0,"I don't know what Dr. Goldberg was like before  moving to Arizona, but let me tell you, STAY AWAY from this doctor and this office. I was going to Dr. Johnson before he left and Goldberg took over when Johnson left. He is not a caring doctor. He is only interested in the co-pay and having you come in for medication refills every month. He will not give refills and could less about patients's financial situations. Trying to get your 90 days mail away pharmacy prescriptions through this guy is a joke. And to make matters even worse, his office staff is incompetent. 90% of the time when you call the office, they'll put you through to a voice mail, that NO ONE ever answers or returns your call. Both my adult children and husband have decided to leave this practice after experiencing such frustration. The entire office has an attitude like they are doing you a favor. Give me a break! Stay away from this doc and the practice. You deserve better and they will not be there when you really need them. I have never felt compelled to write a bad review about anyone until I met this pathetic excuse for a doctor who is all about the money."
0,"I'm writing this review to give you a heads up before you see this Doctor. The office staff and administration are very unprofessional. I left a message with multiple people regarding my bill, and no one ever called me back. I had to hound them to get an answer about my bill. \n\nSecond, and most important, make sure your insurance is going to cover Dr. Goldberg's visits and blood work. He recommended to me that I get a physical, and he knew I was a student because I told him. I got the physical done. Later, I found out my health insurance doesn't pay for preventative visits. I received an $800.00 bill for the blood work. I can't pay for my bill because I'm a student and don't have any cash flow at this current time. I can't believe the Doctor wouldn't give me a heads up to make sure my insurance would cover work that wasn't necessary and was strictly preventative. The office can't do anything to help me cover the bill. In addition, the office staff said the onus is on me to make sure my insurance covers visits. Frustrating situation!"
0,"Owning a driving range inside the city limits is like a license to print money.  I don't think I ask much out of a driving range.  Decent mats, clean balls and accessible hours.  Hell you need even less people now with the advent of the machine that doles out the balls.  This place has none of them.  It is april and there are no grass tees yet.  BTW they opened for the season this week although it has been golfing weather for a month.  The mats look like the carpet at my 107 year old aunt Irene's house.  Worn and thread bare.  Let's talk about the hours.  This place is equipped with lights yet they only sell buckets of balls until 730.  It is still light out.  Finally lets you have the pit to hit into.  When I arrived I wasn't sure if this was a driving range or an excavation site for a mastodon or a strip mining operation.  There is no grass on the range. Just mud.  Makes it a good tool to figure out how far you actually are hitting the ball.  Oh, they are cash only also.\n\nBottom line, this place sucks.  The best hope is that the owner sells it to someone that actually wants to make money and service golfers in Pittsburgh."
0,"This place is absolute garbage...  Half of the tees are not available, including all the grass tees.  It is cash only, and they sell the last bucket at 8, despite having lights.  And if you finish even a minute after 8, don't plan on getting a drink.  The vending machines are sold out (of course) and they sell drinks inside, but close the drawers at 8 on the dot.  There are weeds grown all over the place.  I noticed some sort of batting cage, but it looks like those are out of order as well.  Someone should buy this place and turn it into what it should be."
0,"Used to go there for tires, brakes, etc.  Their prices have gone way up-$400 for 4 mid-level tires for a Toyota.  Plus, 1 of the new tires went flat within 3 weeks.  Since they don\""t make appointments,  the wait to get the tire looked at was ~2 hours.  Sorry--can't wait that long to get a warranted repair,  They lost my business for good."
0,"Terrible. Preordered my tires and when I arrived they couldn't find the order anywhere. Once we got through that process I waited over 2 hours for them to be put on... I was originally told it would take 30 mins. Slow, over priced, I'll go elsewhere next time."
0,"Last summer I had an appointment to get new tires and had to wait a super long time. I also went in this week for them to fix a minor problem with a tire they put on. They \""fixed\"" it for free, and the very next morning I had the same issue. I called to complain, and the \""manager\"" didn't even apologize!!! So frustrated. Never going back.  They seem overpriced, too."
0,"If I could give this place less than one star, I would. I have no idea who gave this place high reviews but they must either own the place or be time travelers from back in the day when this place might not have sucked. The decor is tired and grimy, the place reeked of smoke, and the bartender/server was surly, to put it mildly. We went there on a Saturday night with a mind to try the Irish food. Apparently, we were out of luck. I've always thought that the secrets of restaurant success is to actually stock food for people to eat. He told us before we ordered that they had no \""pies\"". No chicken pot pie, no shepherds pie, etc. So, we gamely tried to order other things. We placed our order. My wife, for example, ordered the Irish stew and he came back 5 min later telling us they were out of that and even more things for several people in our party. At that point my wife picked out a third option, ham and cabbage, only to be told again that \""they were out\"". At that point, realizing that the only food to be had in the place was what was crusted on the menus, we asked to pay for our drinks and left. They actually then gave us flack for not having enough to put it on a debit card. In short, unless you like your dinner with a side of disappointment and depression, I'd probably avoid this place like the plague. Speaking of the plague, I suppose we should thank Mr. Surly for inspiring us to walk out. I only have two bathrooms at my house and would've been hard pressed to accommodate several violently ill people at once."
0,"The delivery driver mistakenly rang my doorbell, having confused 133 and 113.\n\nRather than taking a step back and analyzing the situation, he begins to accuse my wife and I of ordering and refusing to pay for this pizza.\n\nThe driver then gets on his cell phone and rather than calling the number than was given when the order was placed, begins to call his bosses and starts threatening me with felony charges. \n\nSo I take the initiative and ask the fine upstanding gentleman what the phone number of the order-er was, phone my neighbor and discover the mistake. Rather than a thank you or a sorry, he just speeds off (breaking the speed limit on our block) to reach his destination 50 feet away.\n\nI would call to complain, but based on the other reviews, its clear the owners do not care about Carnegie or it's residents, and its pretty well known around town just how awful their food is, so it would be pointless to boycott a place I'd never order from again anyway.\n\nDo yourself a favor and order from ANY other establishment in town."
0,"Some of the worst pizza I've ever had.  We used a coupon from the paper for a 2 topping 8 cut Sicilian. First of all the pizza wasn't even cut through, and the sad attempt at cutting was so uneven that 4 of the slices were about an inch wide, while the others were about 4\"" each. The toppings were scarce, they used mini pepperoni and put maybe 8 on the whole pizza. The onions were huge chunks and the mushrooms were straight from a can. The worst part though was the thick doughy crust that tasted more like a fishy sourdough roll. I'm serious... It was so noticeable that it made me wonder if the dough was bad or if they for some weird reason put fish sauce in it. It was gross. \n\nWe also ordered steak and Italian hoagies. The veggies were old and wilted, and there was no dressing on either. The Italian had deli meat that was clearly bottom of the line and not very generous. The \""steak\"" (if you an call it that) was greyish instead of brown and looked like it was a processed meat chopped into pieces. No flavor or seasoning and the texture was reminiscent of spam. It was so bad that I only ate 1/4 of it and tossed the rest. \n\nI have ordered from here in the past and always been disappointed. I thought I would give them another try since I'd never ordered a Sicilian pizza from there. What a mistake. I will never order from them again!"
0,By far the worst most unprofessional dentist I have ever experienced her staff is too busy watching soap operas on all the TVs in each room instead of cleaning and she gave me a filling which was too deep which could have been understandable as her son had his pictures delivered from Hawaii and she had to stop 3 times to pay for them and show her whole staff all of them must be nice to have a 14 year old go to Hawaii on her moms dime and have her patience wait to see all of this happen I had to have oral surgery and have the tooth removed because she put the filling in too deep an abscessed tooth was the result I wouldn't recommend her to an ex girlfriend or someone I hate because of the three months of extreme tooth pain I had to deal with because of her lack of care and follow through even after I called and asked them for advice and follow up they simply could care less and did not even offer to reschedule an appointment other than prescribing me vicodin and antibiotics do not recommend and do not go to her license should be pulled!!
0,"In all fairness - I did not see this dentist but did schedule an appointment and waited 15 minutes for them to open.\n\nWhen I look at Yelp reviews, I usually weed out the outliers (the best and the worst).   Unfortunately, there are only two reviews.\n\nIt was my first time at the office.   The office admin (very nice) asked for me to come early (before 9am) to complete paperwork.   I arrived at 8:50.    I waited.   I watched 2 employees walk by me (unlocked the door and re-locked it).    They did not acknowledge me.\n\nThe door I was at had signage (open hours).    I decided to leave because of a review where the staff seemed distracted or disinterested in my presence.\n\nThe office admin (very nice) called me to inform I am missing my appointment.   I explained to her that there were too many indications where this was not going to be a good fit and wished her the best of luck.\n\nI recommend if you see this dentist you go to the front door (furthest away from the parking lot) for the entrance.\n\nPoor recommendation because the staff who walked by me seemed to be distracted which was pointed out in a previous review."
0,"I've been to this office a good amount of times.  Each time the receptionists give of a vibe of entitlement and it is very uncomfortable.  Dr. Weinberg herself is very nice, but I doubt her ability. Every procedure she has done to my teeth has backfired. The third and last issue I have is that i always paid cash at the end of my visits and somehow I have received an invoice for $55. I called and of course the receptionist was sassy and rude so I gave up. Will never go back or refer anyone else"
0,Take it from me; avoid this place at all cost.  The only time I go is when I am starved and don't have the energy to cook or get edible food.  And then after I have been kicking myself.
0,We went on a weeknight.  Place was not busy waited over 20 minutes for drinks and to have our order taken.  We ordered an app and it came out with the meals and that was another 20 minutes or so.  Food was luke warm at best.  I would not go back.
0,If you like being greeted in the morning by a gym worker slopping down eggs from a frying pany instead of working....this is your gym....complain to the manager and she gets nasty....try getting in touch with the owner....impossible!  Most unprofessional gym ever!!!!
0,"Terrible service.  Food unremarkable.  Waiter disappeared for 45 minutes to serve larger group due to staffing mismanagement.  Saved his tip by discounting meal after I complained.  All and all, a very crude and unpleasant dining experience for me and my guests.  Not to be repeated, never again!"
0,Terrible service...terrible food...this place smells like rotten wet wood
0,"Absolutely Awful Service.  Went to Papa J's awhile ago and the service was bad - the waiter was surly, rude and unhelpful..  Decided to try it again since it is close to Stage 62.  Big mistake.  Greeted by a dour manager that seemed mad that we had a reservation. 30 minutes to get a glass of wine.  At one hour and 45 minutes complained to the manager that we still had not received out entrees.  He said 'What do you want me to do about it?\"" and said they had a busy night.  This is when tables around us sat empty. I then had to go back to the manager to give us our bill so we could get away from this ruined evening.  The bill was prepared incorrectly. If you want average food and terrible service, this is your place.  We will never go back."
0,"We stopped at Papa J's last Friday night (8/1) for a round of drinks. There were 7 of us altogether and we had eaten at another restaurant earlier in the evening.  One member of our party walked up to the bar to let them know we were sitting on the couches along the wall, as it was fairly busy that night. In the short time that he was there, a man who was behind the bar looked at him and then turn away without saying a word or notifying anyone else. He then turned to a waitress who had approached the service area of the bar and asked her if  we could have a server take our drink order. She said \""yep\"" and then abruptly turned and walked away. At that point, he asked to see the manager  who came a few minutes later. When my friend told him of what had occurred, the manager said \""What do you want me to do\""?\n\nMy friend said \""An apology would be a good start\"" whereupon the manager looked back at him and said \""Get out and don't come back\"" ???????? Are you kidding????\n\nMy friend is well traveled and frequently stays at higher end hotels and dines at quality restaurants. He was not screaming or belligerent in any way, shape, or form; simply informing the manager of what had occurred. \n\nThat being said, we left and went back to 131 East, where we had previously eaten. The service there was fabulous, as was the meal and the drinks creative and exquisite.\n\nThere are new restaurants that have opened in Carnegie as of late. Papa J's is no longer the only game in town.  Obviously this is the way a simple complaint is handled by management. Appalling!!  Do yourself a favor and frequent any of the other restaurants that are within walking distance of Papa J's. They understand the concept of  customer service."
0,"I've decided where I stand with Emmert Dental. They are unprofessional, rude and have no clue what they're doing (behind the desk). I will not be going back nor will I have nice things to say about them."
0,"THE WORST DENTAL EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE.  THEY ARE BUTCHERS!  My husband and I went to Emmert Dental in Bethel Park for a routine cleaning and check up.  I had one tooth that I had a recent root canal on and a few small cavities that needed filled.  After the so called dentist - Dr Carnavali - did my exam, I needed 3 additional root canals and an extraction! An extraction on the tooth that just had a root canal. I was told that part of the tooth had broken off and that a crown was no longer possible.  I didn't know any better, so I agreed to schedule the extraction for a few weeks later. The \""dentist\"" wanted to extract it that day, but I had plans for the weekend and was not about to be in pain. So, 2 weeks later, I went in for the extraction.  After they gave me novocaine they get me with \""you need a bone graft also in that area since we are extracting that tooth\"". I have never had any issues with bone loss with previous extractions so I didn't feel it was necessary. I had 3 employees surrounding me, pressuring me for this bone graft. So, I reluctantly agreed. I had to pay $259.00 for this \""bone graft\"". So, I signed everything. I wasn't even given enough time to read the document, so I should have known and got up and left right then and there. The \""dentist\"" started the extraction. I have never been so uncomfortable in my life. He pulled on my tooth, used a metal instrument to pound on my tooth and was pulling so hard that my head was coming up and slamming back down against the head rest.  Finally, after a good 15 minutes of this torture, he ripped the tooth out of the side of my jaw. I was literally ganging from all the blood running down the back of my throat. He then stuck some pink powder up in the extraction area. I'm assuming this was the bone graft.  I ended up with many stitches. I was given an antibiotic and instructed to schedule an appointment for the following Saturday so they could start the bridge. Then I was hit with a bill of $569.00! My insurance covers 100% of extractions.  I was in so much pain for 2 weeks following the extraction. Pain severe enough that I had to call off work and I couldn't sleep at night.  I refused to go back to Emmert Dental.  And after a visit to a very reputable dentist, an endodontist and an oral surgeon, I have to have oral surgery to try and repair the damage Emmert Dental has done to my mouth.  They caused a very large deformity in my jaw and I am at risk to lose additional teeth.  Save yourself a lot of time, money and pain.  Emmert dental only cares about the money, will over charge you and leave you less than happy with the dental work.  They are butchers and should not even call themselves dentist. And if you have an issue with their billing practices, don't expect to that resolved easily.  I have called numerous times and I am always told that the manager and or billing department is not in.  I have contacted the BBB and a lawyer.  I expect and want a full refund.  No one should have to go thru what I am currently going thru.  They do unnecessary extractions so they can do a more expensive procedure such as a bridge or an implant.  Now I have to go thru oral surgery, more pain and suffering and more time missed from work because of Emmert Dental.  And the root canals they said I needed, my current dentist and my endodontist both agreed that I do not need tooth canals.  In fact, the teeth are perfectly healthy.  They are crooks and butchers."
0,The worst dental office I ever been. No one can beat it!!! You should avoid it at any time.
0,"Eat at your own risk. The service is terrible, the staff seem to be generally clueless, the management is inclined to blame the staff for their own mistakes, and there's no sense of FAST in their fast food. When we came, half of the menu board was still on breakfast, and it was 4:30p. The only thing they have going for them is that the food is hot and tastes just like McDonald's should. \n\nThen again, the franchise is owned by Rice, and I've come to take terrible service is their MO."
0,"My expectations for McDonalds are t rarely high. But for one to still fail so spectacularly...that takes something special!\nThe cashier took my friends's order, then promptly ignored me. I had to force myself in front of a cashier who opened his register to wait on the person BEHIND me. I waited over five minutes for a gigantic order that included precisely one kid's meal. After watching two people who ordered after me be handed their food, I asked where mine was. The manager started yelling at the cashiers for \""serving off their orders\"" when they didn't have their food. But neither cashier was anywhere near those controls, and the manager was the one serving food to customers and clearing the boards.\nThe manager was rude when giving me my order. She didn't make sure that I had everything ON MY RECEIPT, and never even had the decency to apologize that I felt I was getting poor service.\nI've eaten at various McDonalds restaurants for over 30 years. I've worked at more than one location. I expect bad days, bad moods, and the occasional mistake. But I have yet to have a decent experience at this store. It will remain a place I avoid unless someone in my party needs to avoid illness from low blood sugar. Perhaps I should go back to the racially biased service of Steak n Shake instead!"
0,"I've tried to give this McDonalds a chance but my patience has run out. The only reason why I came here as much as I did is because I like the $1 iced coffees. But it's not even worth it. This McDonalds is poo and so is most of the staff. \n\nWhenever I want to go through the drive-thru I can't because there is a line of cars wrapped half away around the building. And even when the line is shorter there's always a hold up of some sort. So most of the time I just park and go inside the restaurant. \n\nToday was a horrible day. I ordered an iced coffee (no cream or sugar) and a chocolate chip cookie. It only takes 30 seconds to fill a cup with coffee and 30 seconds to take a cookie out of the case. I waited 10 minutes!! Sorry but that's too long just to get a coffee and a cookie! It's not like I ordered a meal! During that time I saw people come in after me and get their milkshakes and iced coffees within two minutes! WTH?! I told the petite sleepy eyed cashier I wanted my money back! Her eyes opened wide in surprise, like I really woke her up or something. She said,\""Youre the one who ordered the iced coffee? I can get it for you!\"" For real? She was the one who took my order! I told her I waited too long and I just want my money back. The manager offered to make my iced coffee, but  I refused because I had just had enough.\n\nThere are *few* employees there who work hard but everyone else is dragging their feet. There is no organization or teamwork, everyone is scrabbling. It looks like none of them want to be there. I used to work in fast food and I know it sucks, but come on!\n\nI'm sorry but I can't recommend this Mcdonalds. It's poo. I'm not coming back here anymore. Guess I'll be going to Starbucks- and their iced coffees taste better anyway!"
0,"This McDonald's is so bad it's amazing.  \n\nOrder:  Big mac, large fries, diet coke.\n\nThe soda machine was broken.   No sodas.\n\nThen I got to the window.  \""We rang you up for medium fries.\""   (Not what I asked for)  \""Well, if you want a large, you're gonna have to wait 4 minutes.  We just started a new batch.\""\n\nLeft with:  Big mac, medium fries, no coke.\n\nActually, now that I think about it, this was one of my better experiences there..."
0,"We had the worst possible experience at the Eat N Park at Waterfront on 2/12/10 at around 10pm. Our waitress (Annemarie) was inattentive and got us the wrong order. We ended up with a dish we had not even ordered and still got charged for it on the check. \n\nOne of my friends ordered a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, which according to the menu description, should've had lettuce and tomato in it. But the sandwich that arrived on our table had none of those ingredients. When pointed out to the waitress, she just brought some lettuce and tomatoes in a plate! How crude! \n\nSpoke to the manager after paying the full check and first of all, she did not even offer to re-imburse for the item we did not even order, and that had been forcibly thrust upon us. \n\nWhen I asked the manager about the Buffalo Chicken sandwich not having any lettuce and tomato, she said they just got new menus and that description is not correct and that Buffalo Chicken Sandwich is supposed to be without lettuce and tomato! What a lame excuse! Even your online menu says under the description for a Buffalo Chicken sandwich that its supposed to have both those ingredients - \""Served with lettuce and tomato on a fresh-baked Kaiser roll.\"" - That's what the last line in the description of Buffalo Chicken Sandwich says. Shame on you Manager for lying! Instead of admitting her fault, she was blaming it to a new menu!\n\nNot only did we have to pay for something that we didn't order or eat, but we got sub-standard food that was different from what was described in the menu, and had to deal with a really bad waitress and insensitive and deceitful manager to top off the whole experience. \n\nI am never going to come back to any Eat N Park location ever again, and will never recommend one to any of my friends either. What a waste of time and money! Plus dealing with callous and lying people - my goodness, I surely had my patience tested this evening!"
0,"This is the absolute WORST Steak N Shake I've ever been to. \n\nThe bf and I got lost around Pittsburgh for 40 min. trying to find this location and on top of the unnecessary 1 hour wait for our food, the food itself was just so crappily made. It was so bad and we had waited a ridiculous amount of time (c'mon, Steak N Shake is basically a glorified McD's), our waiter comped our WHOLE MEAL.\n\nIf not for the compensation, I would have been pissed that we had to pay for such a crappy meal. The bf, on the other hand, was more upset about the principle of the matter... we had trekked all that way just to get our Steak N Shake fix (since both of us haven't had it since our undergraduate days) and it was a major fail.\n\nI think I'm good with my Steak N Shake craving for a long time now...\n\n\n\nPS. The whole joint smells like major B.O."
0,"I went here at 3 PM between the lunch rush and the dinner rush, and the restaurant was maybe 20% full. I ordered the Chili Mac Supreme to go. I thought I would be in and out within 5-10 minutes. Keep in mind that this restaurant even has a drive-thru; the expectation is quick service.\n\nLong story short, my food never came... the waitress told me (after I had been sitting there waiting for thirty minutes) that the kitchen hadn't even started on my order yet, so I told her to cancel it and walked out. Now I see that others on Yelp have warned about the slow service at this location. Wish I had looked it up earlier."
0,The only thing worse than the food is the service.
0,"Terrible wait staff  couldn't even seat us. Before we, and another party walked out without even being greeted properly, I observed several employees traipse out the front door, several tables who were waiting for their food for a long time,  several employees just standing around out of direct view of the tables, a morbidly obese hostess that could barely physically walk from one end of the store to the other. I think one server was high. \n  \n  Going there was a  special request by a 7 year old getting over a long-ish illness, so that makes the shabby treatment more enraging."
0,"Food is good, what you'd expect from Steak n Shake. THE SERVICE IS AWFUL. so incredibly awful. expect to take at least an hour for your meal, even when it's slow. I've been going here for years when I want a cheap meal, but the service is so so so awful. Go to McDonalds."
0,"The service was fast but the food was terrible and so was the service. I had a bus to catch so I couldn't wait around waiting for the check so I went to the counter to pay. She never brought my check, never checked to see if my drink needed refilled, she just mopped the floors. \n\nThe burger was really greasy, the fries were Luke warm and the cheese on them wasn't as flavorful as it should be. As a new Pittsburgher I'm not impressed."
0,"I should have known better than to stop here, but I was nursing a hangover and just wanted something quick and simple.  I should kick myself for thinking of this place.\n\nGranted I decided to go to the drive thru and knew there would be a wait.  The sign actually says that the food is prepared when you order it.  I sat for almost ten minutes at the window while my food was prepared.  During that time I wished I could have taken back my order and also wished that I hadn't paid already.  \n\nWhile sitting at the window I decided to just stare inside and watch some of the employees doing their job.  What disturbed me the most was watching the employee making the milkshakes.  Making a milkshake isn't that hard or glamorous of a thing to watch.  What disgusted me was that the guy actually lifted several of the containers for the milkshakes and smelt them.  I mean smelt them to see if they were clean, instead of actually taking the extra minute or two to clean the container.  After witnessing this my food was finally ready and I drove away.\n\nWhen I finally got to eating my food I was underwhelmed.  The fries had no flavor and with the size of the cut it appears you get more than what you ordered.  The \""steakburger\"" really, they should just call it a burger, was overpowered by the BBQ sauce on it.  It was all I could taste.\n\nAll this has cemented me in not wanting to ever step foot in one of these establishments ever again."
0,"You know what you're getting with a Steak N Shake: it's about one rung up from a McD's in quality, and about two rungs down in quickness. At least, you think you know. \n\nI used to have a small place in my heart (though the salt and fat weren't very kind to said organ) for Steak N Shake, because hey, who can argue with beef and drinkable ice cream? But after my last trip, I can think of nothing more disgusting than having to eat here, this location in particular. I haven't been back in over year, and I will never step foot into a Steak N Shake as long as I have an immune system that I care about. \n\nAfter having eaten here, I hit the restroom on my way out (along with my two friends....hey, we're girls, it's acceptable!). One stall was already taken, so two of us are stuck waiting while this occupant does her....shall we say, business? After a few seconds, we realize that she's not only there to relieve herself, but to also take drive-through orders. Yes, that's right....\""You want fries with that? *flush* Okay, that will be $5.50\"". I have never, ever witnessed anything so insane as a drive-through restroom. To top it off, after finishing her \""bathroom break\"", she walks straight out of the stall and into the restaurant. I guess she was in too much of a rush to complete the order she had just taken that she didn't have time to wash her hands. And I was in too much of a rush to choke back up what I had just eaten before it wreaked mayhem on my stomach."
0,"I love Steak N Shake. This one, however, leaves a lot to be desired. The food often comes out cold and the servers are apathetic at best. Most of the time, they're downright rude. I highly recommend avoiding this location if possible. There's one on Route 51 that's worth the 15 minutes it'll take you to get there."
0,"Every time we come here the service is laughably bad. On this visit a tabe which was sat after us had their food before our server graced us with her surly presence. Good restaurant elsewhere, just avoid this location if you want to get your food inside an hour."
0,"Wow. Dirty and slow.  The floors felt like they had the days burger grease spilled all over, and it took 30 m8n to get our take out order."
0,"This location is terrible. The drive-thru workers are rude and they give you crap food. I waited 5 minutes before being able to order, even when there was only 1 car ahead of me. Then the lady proceeded to ask me if I would like anything on my burger, and (thinking the pictures on the menu are what they're supposed to look like and they would never false advertise) I asked \""doesn't it come with the fixings like in the picture?\"" she then told me it only comes with cheese. So I then went on to tell her what I wanted on my burger. Pulled around and got my order pretty quick, but later when I open my burger its just meat and cheese. The meat is badly burned and cold. It was clear to me this burger was not fresh. I didn't even attempt to eat it, what a waste of a place. They definitely need better workers."

Does the name on account match name on check?  Nope, but mistakes happen at those pesky check companies.\n3. Does the account number on the check match the account number on the screen?  Why should it, those computers are always making mistakes.\n\nNow that we have verified that all the information is correct, we can process the payment.  The customer will be so happy that we didn't have to bother them with any silly questions.\n\n******\nI am sad to say that this is an actual occurrence.  What was originally an average Lowe's has turned into Lowe's Hell.  If the associates do not have basic logic comprehension, how do they survive?"
0,"Would like to give NO STARS.  bought all new kitchen appliances there.  Refrigerator is defective.  They\nsend an outside company to repair.  Man arrives with NO TOOLS and wrong size seal for freezer.  not once, twice.  The first time, he tries to use my spoon from counter to install it!  I complain, too bad...they have to comeTHREE times before replacing it!  NEVER AGAIN."
0,"Before today I probably would have given this place three stars based mostly on their beer selection; however, today the service was terrible. We waited two hours for a pizza sub, French onion soup, fries, and buffalo chicken tenders. About an hour and a half in we finally got the small pizza sub and the wrongly made buffalo chicken tenders (ie, no hot sauce). We were told by the waitress that she realized it was wrong, but decided to still bring it out to see if my gf would eat it. She sent it back. By a half hour later, we still had not received the buffalo chicken tenders, nor the French onion soup (which should have been mostly made already), and no fries.  We were told the chef was new, but no effort was made really to make the situation better. No quick and easy app or beers on the house. To boot, the beer was pretty expensive. I will probably give the place another chance based on their beer selection, but it won't be for a while. The food has always been average at best, and the pizza sub was no different. We ended up leaving after two hours without receiving 75% of our order."
0,"The food was absolutely gross! I ordered a turkey club which comes on a wheat bun with avocado, bacon, and turkey breast. What I got was TOTALLY different from the picture! First of all the sandwich was on sliced bread (lame)! There was no avocado, 1 slice of bacon, no lettuce, and to TOP it off instead of turkey breast they used freaking LUNCH MEAT! lol No, not the kind that you get from the deli, the other sweaty nasty looking stuff! Gross! \n\nOur waitress was awful but they were extremely understaffed so I would have a bit of an attitude if I had to wait 10 tables without assistance too.   \n\nThe manager was really nice... Of course that disgusting sandwich that I didn't eat was free."
0,Mediocre service. COLD food! Our food waited so long the lettuce & pickles wilted. Bland food. Crazy overpriced. Long waits in the arcade. 1 beer per hour maximum.  Avoid at all costs. Fair manager.
0,This place just plain sucks\nBad management lost them biz\nDumb arcade drama*\n\n* they have recently changed their under 21 policy so no one underage can even be in the arcade or restaurant after 10pm despite having a guardian over 30 years old
0,"Visited the Dave and Busters in Homestead, PA last night. Waitress mixed up our credit cards and gave my brothers credit card to someone else and he theirs. Charged them already too - both incorrectly My brother had to walk around and find out who it was. Waitress never apologized. GM was extremely rude and refused to give my brother his original receipt back saying they had thrown it out. DID NOTHING TO REMEDY the situation and ignored us the rest of our visit - not even a refill. After spending over $300 plus games, we will never go back. Whatever happened to the customer is always right? HORRIBLE service"
0,"Most of the games were out of order and I had to find one of those referee looking people to fix 2 of them that took some of our credits.  Apathetic service staff all around, the Peanut and I were really disappointed.  Won't be back."
0,"I was here on 10/3 and I have to say this was a horrible experience.  Me and a friend went here to eat and play a couple games afterwards.  It took the waitress at least 10-15 minutes to greet us and by that time we knew we should just order then because we might not see her again.  We ordered and got our drinks and well let's just say we didn't see the waitress again until she was giving us our check (some manager delivered the food to the table).  No refill on my beverage, no how is your food, no ketchup for my burger or fries was offered.  Lots of people running around like crazy and if your understaffed hire more people!  I will not be back again to eat."
0,"Horrible beer, horrible service, horrible menu"
0,My friends got everyhing from steak(they didn't even get a well done steak right) to mahi tacos and the only great menu item was the seasoned vegetables- give it a miss. Sing sing next door is awesome but get dinner somewere else. After we were done the waiter asked if we were ready for the checks and I had ordered meal that came with a desert! Really dissapointing all around.
0,For a brewery who is attempting to take advantage of Oktoberfest you wonder how at 7 pm they could be out of mashed potatoes & sauerkraut then a sausage platter with sweet mustard guess they have not been to Germany. Not worth $5.95 unfortunately the sausage platter was $15.95.
0,Came with my BF we started with the crab artichoke dip. It was very greasy and had virtually no crab. The wedge salad was good and crisp. I had the hazelnut crusted chicken. This has to be one of the worst dishes I've ever had it was like pancake syrup over breaded chicken. To finish the meal we had the homemade chocolate chip cookies served with hot fudge. Well there was no hot fudge it was chocolate syrup the ice cream was so crystallized from melting and re-freezing all around disappointing.
0,"Poor service and food. I waited 20 minutes at the bar for someone to just acknowledge my presence. They finally brought my food out and left it without asking for me to pay.... So I had to wait an additional 15 minutes to find someone to pay. Yes, I had to TRY and give them money.\n\nOn to the important part... Food was terrible. I had a burger and it was pathetic."
0,"Be careful. The servers can't pay attention to save their lives, and the management cares even less. I want to make sure people know how careless the management is, particularly Mark who seems to let his staff run around."
0,"My friends & I all purchased Groupons  for the Pittsburgh Improv on or around March 22nd, 2012. At that time, only a few big name comedians were listed on the Improv's website as Special Events. You can use the Groupon on anything that isn't a Special Event. That seemd reasonable. The day the Groupons were purchased, my friend Katrina called & reserved two tickets to Jim Jeffries for 3/30 at 10pm. They allowed her to use her Groupon & gave her a confirmation code & everything! Shortly after, they changed many of the comedians on their website, including Jim Jeffries, to Special Events. When I called I was told I could not use my Groupon. The same thing happened to many of my friends. It's a classic bait & switch. These comedians were NOT Special Events until after the Groupon came out. In addition, other restrictions, such not being able to use the Groupons on Saturdays & having to use the additional four vouchers for one show, were NOT listed under the restrictions when the Groupon was for sale. \n\nSo tonight, my friends & I had pretty much resolved ourselves to the fact that we were not going to the Improv because they wouldn't allow us to use our Groupons. But I walked over to the Will Call window with my friend Katrina so she could at least get her tickets. Big surprise - she was told they didn't have her reservation or her name in their computers! They wouldn't give her the tickets. It's an absolute joke of a deal. How is everyone going to use their Groupons by Sept. if all of the shows are Special Events now? \n\nIn addition, no one at the Improv answers the phones or responds to emails. \n\nMy friends & I (about 10 of us total) are all getting refunds through Groupon and/or our credit card companies & we are all reporting the Improv to the Better Business Bureau, etc. \n\nThe Pittsburgh Improv is extremely shady & does not care about their customers."
0,"This review is specifically for the DFS cleaners at this Giant Eagle location.  I dropped clothing off for the sake of convenience once (I really should have known better).  Never again.  My items came back completely covered in lint.  I could let this slide, however my pencil skirt was safety pinned to the hanger.  The weight of the skirt caused even larger holes than what were placed there by the pins.  Being that it's a pencil skirt designed to have a blouse tucked in, there's no way that I can wear it again.  This was an expensive skirt, completely ruined.  Very disappointed.  Again, this review is just for the dry cleaners.  The rest of the store is actually better than a lot of other GE's I've been to in Pittsburgh.  Just don't take your dry cleaning here."
0,"We were going to see a movie that started at 9:40pm. The 2 of us got to Bar Louie at 8:30.  We sat outside, and it was nearly 30 minutes before the waiter even stopped to get our order.  I tried stopping a waitress but was told 'this isn't my table'.  Finally the waiter took our order.  1 Sam Adams light bottle, and one Pineapple Juice+Vodka.  After about 15minutes another waiter (maybe the manager I don't know) asked if we had been waited on. We said yes, and told him we had been waiting.  He left, and another (different) waitress came to bring us our drinks.. they were wrong.. My date was given vodka on the rocks. and I was given a Sam Adams.. \nThey took these back, and another 10 minutes before the correct order was served.. We told them to bring another round and the check.  It was 20 minutes before they returned.. and they forgot the check.\n\nBy this time we had to go to be on time for the movie.. my date asked for the check again so we could leave.. finally they brought it and I gave him my card, when he came back we signed it and left in a hurry to catch the movie.\n\nfor 2 bottle beers, and 2 pineapple juice + vodka I was charged $31.03. I didn't have time to complain or ask. I won't be going back."
0,When the ratio to wait staff to diners is 3:1 you'd think you could get service!!!\n\nNothing erks me more then seeing idol wait staff and hungry patrons. I very rarely walk out of a restaurant with out having eaten first. I came here on Saturday ay 6pm. Almost none of the diners had food on their table and many of them didn't have drinks in the 15 minutes I was there I counted 9 waitress again I counted 9 waitresses and not a one of them came over to our table to get even a drink order. Just from the looks of it I could tell staying any longer would be a total train wreck. So after 15 minutes of waitress counting we left with empty bellies.
0,"I came here last night to get a few appetizers before a movie, and was hoping to be able to write a review on the food. Unfortunately, I cannot because the service was so bad that I left before I had the chance to order. We found seats at the bar behind the taps. After sitting there for 5 minutes and not being acknowledged, we thought that they might not be able to see us, and so we moved to a different pair of seats in the middle of the bar, grabbing a few menus on the way so we would be ready to order. It was fairly busy, but it is not like there were people standing at the bar trying to get drinks - everyone was seated and I'm sure they face much busier times. We sat in our new seats for almost 15 minutes (I timed it - I am not exaggerating), and were not even acknowledged. You would at least think the bartender would acknowledge us and tell us he would be with us when he could, but despite staring him down almost the whole time, we could not even make eye contact. I hope this is a fluke but will probably not be back to find out."
0,"The absolute worst service I have ever had at any bar or restaraunt.  And, in looking at other reviews, I am not the first.  There are many options at the Waterfront, and I would suggest you try any of them; but stay far away from this place!"
0,"Servers are chatting, not paying attention to tables. I can see my salad is ready at the window. Worst serves ever."
0,"Meh, I just don't see the appeal Bar Louis has to Pittsburghers. I guess this particular restaurant benefits from people who work at the Waterfront stopping in after a shift. It's always packed. Being so close to the AMC theater, they get traffic before and after movies. \n\nIt's expensive, the food is so so. Before I get ahead of myself, I had the BBQ ranch chicken salad without chicken. The BBQ ranch dressing was very good, but it's very easy to duplicate at home. It's equal parts ranch dressing and KC Masterpiece hickory BBQ sauce and a drop or two of Worcestershire and a drop of franks hot sauce. \n\nTuesday is dollar burgers 5 until midnight, daily drink and happy hour selections, but even that's not enough to get me here. Skip it. One caveat for this location, free parking. At Station Square's location you gotta pay to park the jalopy.\n\nI'm eager to see if this place sees a huge drop in business when Burgatory opens across the street."
0,"We stopped here to enjoy a drink before our movie. Our server, was friendly. My husband had a margarita and my server suggested a berry mojito to me.\nBoth drinks were overly sweet and barely any alcohol.  After I finished my drink, I used my fork to dig for the blackberries at the bottom only to find (to my disgust), a decent sized piece of clear saran wrap! Ugg! Did they muddle the mint into the saran wrap?!!! She comped the drink but we won't be back.\nCan't speak about the food since we didn't have any but atmosphere was loud and it was difficult to have a conversation without repeating yourself."
0,"I can't even review this place. We sat ourselves and waited for a waitress to take our order, and we waited and waited until we got tired and just left. And I have to be clear it was a Saturday afternoon, maybe like 10 tables with people at them and I saw 3 waitress walking around. I think it's probably a bad idea to ignore people that come into your restaurant, especially since burgatory just opened across the street."
0,"Other people may have had a better experience with this company but that was not the case for us.  We had rented a limo/bus for a bachelor party.  Our driver Scott, was completely clueless in navigating the city. Constantly making wrong turns and missing exits. All of this after very thorough instruction as to where to go. Each destination took 3-4 times longer to reach due to his incompetence. This caused us to have to skip a couple of our originally planned stops. After returning to the bus after one of our stops we were informed by Scott that the police had come onto the bus and searched it with dogs. Really?!??!  Why??!!  How??!!  We found that our bags had been rifled through and we all felt a little violated and confused. By this point we decided to call it a night. More than half of our passengers didn't care to step back onto the bus and took cabs home. \n\nJust when we thought the worst was over we were wrong. As we enter the highway we realize that Scott has driven all the way up the ramp and onto the highway going THE WRONG WAY!!!  He starts slowly reversing down the ramp while oncoming cars honk and swerve all around us!  Truly terrifying. After that, we were very upset and just wanted to get home. So after several more wrong turns we finally get home. Absolutely terrible night. \n\nSo if you'd like to book a party bus that will include a geographically blind driver, unecessary police involvement, a near death experience and just an overall sense of frustration mixed with panic then go with these guys. Otherwise, I would suggest staying far, far away!"
0,"The worse \""Chinese food\"", even the white rice which came with the ogle sweet and sour chicken is really bad.  Please don't eat this food."
0,Boo!  What happened to this location?  It used to be happy and fun!  It just feels depressing and nearly everyone there is just doing the bare minimum to get by?  So sad.
0,"Awful everything. From the bad service, to the diluted soup, to the lame-no chicken on the chicken salad, to the PRE-fabricated pizza. AVOID THIS PLACE!"
0,"Well, it started well. Food was okay. Deep dish pizza was good. But the salad we had - too tiny portion!!!\nWe were greeted and seated well. But later the service was not all good. Bad bad service. First of all we had to ask for everything we wanted. The server didn't even had courtesy to ask if we wanted anything more or would like to go for deserts. She just handed over the check when we even didn't ask for it (we wanted to order more).\nLater when we talked about this in the front, the girl there also just listened and said \""okay\"", not even a sorry once!!!\nI would not like to go there again... :("
0,Nope!
0,"Interesting the reviews here are less than stellar already. I would normally not review a chain retail store, but the service I received today just really got my blood boiling.\n\nI will state, as I always do in these types of situations, that I have worked many years in retail. I know what you're supposed to do. I know the ways I've displayed exemplary service and I know the ways I've slacked off. I get it, I really do.\n\nSo I'm in the store early. Hardly any people in there. Weird for the Semi-Annual Sale time of year. Usually it doesn't matter what time you're there during the sale, it's always busy. \n\nI went through my usual bins and picked up a mess of undies and bras. Since no one was at the check out counter and I needed a spot to go through things, I set them down and started to try and chat with the sales chick. I actually always like to do this, just to shoot the breeze, but also to get their opinions on items I'm buying. \n\nThe girl behind the counter was having non of this though.I asked her about a bra and she said she didn't know about that one, but said it should work. I understand, you can't try them all. But the thing that really irked me was that she was definitely not hiding her annoyance at me setting down my things on the counter. I even looked back to make sure there were no people checking out behind me. Ghost town. Tumbleweed rolled by. No one.\n\nSo I'm going through my stuff and separating what I want and don't want and she's sighing and grabbing things saying \""Soooo, you DON'T want these???\"" Um, I'm not asking you to help me sort things. I'm not holding up a line. I'm just trying to not spend $$$ on an accidental XS pair of undies that got mixed in! \n\nAfter that, it's not exactly what she said, but how she acted. I have never felt more uncomfortable in a retail store before. I ended up grabbing my discards and putting them back myself (which I really don't mind doing, but after she huffed and puffed, I didn't even want to deal with her). \n\nThe thing is, I was nice the entire time. I don't expect you to sit there and be sugary sweet either. Just do what you were hired to do. Be nice and sell some bras. If you come to work in a bad mood, the real world is not going to give you a hug. Suck it up and do your job or work where you don't have to talk to anyone else ever."
0,"Honestly, I'm furious. I enjoyed PF Chang's restaurants in the Chicago area, and my wife and I have eaten a few times at this Pittsburgh-area location. Over the last year, we have tried repeatedly, but the 90-120 minute wait for dinner is unacceptable. We tried going early, late -- it never made any difference. The front staff was rude, and the wait was too long.\n\nTonight, we had a special date planned, and made reservations a week in advance. We came in the door exactly on time, waited in the line to see the front staff, and we were promptly handed a pager. They couldn't tell us when we would be seated.\n\nI imagined a short wait, so we went outside, crossed into a store to wait (since the entrance of this location is so packed, it's impossible to wait at the bar or in the meager seating).\n\nAfter 20 minutes we gave up. We went back to PF Chang's and the front office staff still couldn't tell us when we would be seated. I saw open tables.\n\nWhat on earth is the point of accepting reservations if you do not honor them?\n\nThe food here is good, but certainly not great. We went to a local Thai place and were seated with no problem in 5 minutes. The food was much better, the service was good even in a crowded busy restaurant. Oh, and the local place was a much more reasonable price.\n\nWe certainly will never visit PF Chang's again."
0,"This was my first time at this PF Chang's and I was not impressed. The service was extremely slow even though it was a Sunday night and the restaurant was not very busy. The portions were small. \n\nThey were also playing 5 year old pop music really loud. Pop music?! Come on--this is an \""Asian Bistro.\"""
0,"Walked in tonight, Wednesday, at 9:50, the place was empty. Asked for a table, the hostess told us one moment when she finds one for us, then proceeded to walk to a dirty table and clean it!  The phone rang and she answered it as we stood at the door. When she hung up the phone she walked back to the table and proceeded to clean it again!!  Didn't say a word to us. Unbelievable!  Will not be back there-- rude hostess!"
0,"We went last night Saturday night to P.F.Chang located at the Kierlands in Scottsdale. Terrible Experience!!! after waiting over one hour to be seated, we ordered calamari for appetizer which came with a horrible strange salty sauce and salt and pepper mix on the side. then I ordered beef and broccoli and my husband ordered a vegetarian dish with peanut sauce . After a long wait my food came so salty that I could not even eat and as much as I hate to complain but I had to let the waiter know, so he went to get me one with less salt. My husband's dish was OK. then the second one was a bit less salty but the meat had a terrible liver kind of taste which totally turned my stomach. I feel the reason they added so much salt was to hide the bad tasting rotted meat. Very bad experience. Our waiter was kind and sympathetic. ruined my evening out :("
0,"Let me start off by saying I have mostly simple tastes, and my favorite lunch spot for Chinese has been the New Dumpling House in Squirrel Hill. But since that restaurant is undergoing renovations, I was forced to try something new.\n\nSo... I thought I'd try the chain PF Chang's Chinese Restaurant at the Waterfront. Wow, what an unsatisfying mistake that turned out to be.\n\nI started with a cup of their Wonton soup. At $2.95 it wasn't too outrageous of a price, the broth had some flavor and there was much more in it than I was used to, including three giant basil (I think?) leafs that covered everything beneath. In the broth were chunks of chicken, two shrimp, some sliced water chestnuts and two \""pork\""-filled wontons. As I said, the broth had decent flavor, but the wontons were thick, doughy and under-cooked, and the chicken chunks were dry, which is amazing since they were drowned in broth! On a scale of bad to good, it was kind of meh.\n\nNext came my \""lunch-portion\"" order of Chang's Kung Pao Chicken (the dinner portion is $5 more). \n\nAt the New Dumpling House, this dish is served with a delectable dark, rich, tangy sauce, which I was really hoping for... Not at PF Chang's. \n\nOn my plate I received about 8 quarter-size chunks of lightly breaded and browned chicken, 7 hot Chinese red chili peppers (mostly inedible unless they are diced into a sauce), a handful of blanched, unsalted peanuts, a few sliced scallions, and a bed of the most bland brown rice I have ever encountered. Uncle Ben would've been ashamed if that stuff came out of one of his boxes.\n\nGlaringly, there was NO SAUCE!. None at all.\n\nI've had Kung Pao Chicken in New York City, San Francisco, and even from a hole in the wall in Bethel Park, PA that was much, much better. Never have I had it served in such a bland, skimpy, and overpriced way! The \""lunch-portion\"" cost was $9.95.\n\nAt The New Dumpling House, I could have a delicious lunch, with soup, entree and complimentary hot tea, and I could leave satisfied with just $8 out-of-pocket -- and that includes the tip.\n\nThe service was decent. However, lesson learned. One and done. Never going back to PF Changs."
0,"The food was fine. It's a chain. I'm not rating it. \n\nThe service was absolutely horrible. It started well enough when we ordered lunch, but ended horribly when my daughter said we should get a treat for my husband. \n\nBetween being ignored by the girl at the counter, her not listening to the order, then arguing with me when I told her I did not ask for what she brought me, I really can't decide which is worse. I rather spend my money somewhere local where they appreciate my business, rather than take attitude from Panera employees."
0,"Let's start this review by saying that when we are at that point, my girlfriend and I will be going to Jos. A. Bank for mine and my groomsman's suits.  Allow me to give you a numbered breakdown of the issues we encountered when renting from Men's Wearhouse to be the groomsmen in our friends wedding.\n\n1- They never contacted us after the fitting after saying there would be a followup call.  The other groomsmen and I had to follow up repeatedly to get an answer as to when our tuxedos would arrive and the staff were very short with our honest questions over the phone.\n2- They sent two of our tuxedos to Homestead when we asked for them to be sent to Ross Park Mall during the fitting.\n3- When one of us called two days prior to the wedding to ask if our tux's had arrived the guy answering the phone said \""Oh... I don't know\"" (insert an awkward, pregnant pause here while waiting for him to say \""Let me check that for you\"") he instead said \""Well, I'm going to hang up now.\""  And he made good on that promise, and hung up.\n4- Despite saying we'd get a call a few weeks ahead of the wedding to be resized in case one of us gained a few lbs over the winter, this call never came so we basically had to hope that everything fit as it needed to.\n5- We were at one point informed that MW had our emails on file and that when our tuxes arrived at the store we would receive an email letting us know.  Not a single groomsman received any such email to that effect.\n6- One of the groomsmen randomly received a black tie while everybody else had white.  Another received no studs.  We discovered this approximately two hours to show-time while relatively far from civilization.\n7- On picking up my tux I informed the associate \""I'll be unable to get to a Men's Wearhouse for a few days after the wedding, is this alright?\"" to which she responded \""Yeah that should be fine\"" so when my girlfriend graciously dropped off my tux for me a few days later and learned of the $100 late fee, I was totally caught off guard.\n8- My girlfriend was also caught totally off guard by the associate at Ross Park Mall who was incredibly rude to her when  he informed her of said late fee.\n9- As the Best Man I was given a coupon card for $50 off my next rental at Men's Wearhouse.  Since I am in another wedding next month with rentals from MW I figured this would be an opportune time to use it.  Imagine my shock while paying for the next weddings rental, when I presented the coupon and was told \""Oh, that isn't for this.  That is intended for YOUR wedding.  Oh and it expires on December 31st of this year.\"" \n10- The groom himself decided to use a coupon to purchase a suit for the wedding and to own, rather than rent a tux for the occasion.  He was ensured by the Homestead staff that the coupon would be fine for this purpose and got fitted for it.  When he went to pick up his suit and pay with the aid of said approved coupon he was instead forced into an argument with an associate who insisted he could not use the coupon towards the suit that an associate a few weeks earlier had insisted he could use.  Granted, now I am speaking for another person so take that with as much salt as you may, but he reiterated this fact to me several times prior to his wedding last week.\n\nOver my friends wedding weekend, any time anything even went slightly wrong at and around his wedding, the joke between the Groom and his Groomsmen was \""Effing Men's Wearhouse.\""  For example, at a restaurant, \""Wait I asked for no onions on this sandwich. - Effing Men's Wearhouse!\""  \""Noise complaint at the hotel room? Men's Wearhouse.\""\n\nAnother groomsman looked at me when we discovered the wrong color tie one of us received and said to me \""I hope you're taking notes for your own impending wedding\"" to which I replied \""Perhaps I could find better service from GoodWill of Western PA\""\n\nCongrats Men's Wearhouse.  You became the butt of every joke for every mishap for an entire weekend around a wedding to which you provided the suits.\n\nTL;DR - 10 mistakes, several rude associates and 1 future groom going to Jos. A. Bank."

0,"I'm not a mean reviewer, if you look at the other places I've reviewed, but this was just so so so disappointing. The Shanghai style Merlin was very poorly done. The meat was extremely bland, with very little seasoning. I have a very low sodium tolerance and yet I still found this fish to be made too bland. The rice was entirely uncooked and it made crunching sounds as I took my first bite. I talked to the waitress and she offered to bring out another side. It wasn't the same. The whole dish was a fail and I don't think I am ever coming back again :("
0,"Will I come here again?  Yes absolutely for drinks, they knocked the Ketel One extra dirty blue cheese olive martini outta the park.  The ambiance is very nice.  Of the 4 types of reviews I give (awesome, OK, bad where they get slammed and bad where I hope they improve) here I am giving the heartfelt \""bad where I hope they improve.\""  Our waitress was very friendly and did a good job.  I mentioned the gritty redskins of the mashed potato.  We went with appetizers she recommended.  Not good.  \n\nSeared ahi tuna: horrible flavors mixed with the rub, the prep, the tuna wasn't cool inside, the chips were not good, there was no soy sauce but there was wasabi.  NOT good.  With heartfelt advice, compare this against Outback's ahi tuna appetizer and it's no contest.  The chef should do so.  (He's a nice guy like me I hope.)  \n\nBBQ shrimp: go try Redstone's (Philly) buffalo shrimp appetizer.  It is chilled, very delicious.  This appetizer was recommended and was garbage.  The barbecue sauce was horrible, overwhelmed and left an unsavory aftertaste in both my and my clients' palate.  Gordon Food Service or Sysco BBQ sauce.  A real \""must-miss\"".  \n\nCod entree was OK.  The skillet beans were too firm, too mature, they need petite green beans.  Potato skin had grit in the mashed.  Why 1 star?  The price was close to Capital Grille, but far from the cuisine.  I hope they spruce it up.  The place is nice."

0,A group of us traveld here to go kenneywood park across the road but we decided not to after what we drove throuhg to get there so we atleast decided to get somthing to eat and man where we happey to get out alive. We where the only normal people in this place. The kids next to us who where only 14 where bragging and saying that they went to jail 2 times in their life. You had people selling their food outsdie the resturant. after seeing that we quickly left and hid in our cars with the doors locked. While we where in there my friend got hit on by 2 girls and they gave him there numbers while the other young guy across the table yeld dont do it dont do it. Must I say more? bottom line is dont go if you are normal and get the hell out of that area cause if you call a shank a happey meal toy then that is the resturant for you.
0,"By far the worst McDonald's in the world.  Employees are to busy playing grab ass behind the counter, to get your order correct.  Ninety percent of the time you receive the wrong order, after waiting what seems an eternity.  I've even enjoyed the experience of going through the drive thru, only to get home and find no beef patties on my Big Mac.  Save yourself the aggravation, and do not go here."
0,"By far the absolute worst Mcdonalds in the\nWorld. You can pretty much rest assured that, after your long wait in the drive thru, your order will most definitely be wrong.  Calls to the owner go ignored. Rice Enterprises own a majority of the McDonalds in the South Hills.  They have all gone down hill in quality, service and cleanliness.  The owner has to be the problem."
0,Well for my first time here I was way less than impressed. The lady at the front counter was a crab and  the Pierogies really weren't that great. Rather than be kind and answering my questions I settled with the potato and cheese pierogies. I guess Bloomfield Bridge tavern or Mrs. T's is still my go to place. And plus this place is way out of my way to be treated poorly. I wouldn't go back

0,"I have never gotten an order correct from this specific McDonald's. I'm not sure what the problem is, but it is never, ever right. It is never quick. The staff is always rude. After trying at least 12-15 times over the past year, I've finally given up hope on this place. Do not recommend."
0,My orders have come out bad pretty much every time I have ordered from here. The chicken nuggets come out under par. I'm lucky if the fries come out right. My last experience is the last straw. I recently posted a photo of my Chicken Ranch Club. That has no chicken. This is ridiculous. I am done going to this Mcd's.
0,"Delivery is slow and not even close to the best Chinese in the area.  No matter if it's rice or noodles or chicken or pork, everything tastes off--like it's been overcooked in mop-bucket-water.  Try House of Lee instead."
0,"Wow. What a shame. My family just moved to the area and have been sampling the local cuisine. We are a very large family and love foods of all kind. We've eaten Chinese food from a hundred different places in a dozen different cities. Hands down, this was the worst we've ever had. Cold, tough, congealed, and tasteless - that's the only way to describe it. I'll never order from here again. Quite frankly, the fact that I took time away from my kids to type this out should tell you how awful it was. My complaints fell on deaf ears. I guess they were shocked that someone thought that they were serving low grade dog food. I understand that sometimes restaurants crank out bad food. It happens. But when it does, you bend over backwards to make it right. Not at this place. I was told that he would have to speak with the owner in order to help me. I guess that's how they deflect complaints - blame it on the owners that aren't there and make the customer for away angry.  Too bad. Because we will be visiting a competitor in the future. This family of 7 won't be visiting China Sea ever again. Oh, and by the way, why can't I give this place zero stars?"
0,"The pros:\nYou get a TON of food for your money. If the food was actually decent, this would have been even better because... LEFTOVERS. \nThey have coupons on their website that you can use whenever. \n\n\nThe cons:\nThe woman who answers the phone is kinda rude. You try to ask her questions and she gets an attitude with you like you're wasting her time. \nMy pork dumplings were \""fried\"" only on one side and were raw in the middle. \nEverything was pretty darn salty. Yeah, I get it. Chinese food tends to be a little salty, but this was unacceptably salty. \nLeftovers... Yes this is also a con because I threw it away. Suffering through it once was enough! \n\nIf you're craving something made fresh that is spicy and sweet, you're not going to find it here. Just very greasy, very salty, poor excuse for Chinese takeout."

0,"OMG who wrote the review below? A big fat liar/someone that was paid to write that! I stayed there for an hour this past weekend (my friend and I were both intoxicated and figured laying down a few hours would get us better suited to finish driving home). This place looks like it hasb't been cleaned (or furnished) since the 80s. Literally there was grime on the walls, and squashed, unwiped bug smears too. Ok, so not the best, but for two hours, we could deal. We looked for bed bugs, and didn't see any immediate signs of them- so we laid down to rest. After about 20-30 minutes, we both started itching like crazy. I ran to the bathroom mirror (there was mold all over the bathroom) and saw bed bug bites all on my shoulders, arms, and legs. HORRIBLE!! PLEASE Health Department, shut them down! It's deplorable in there!!"
0,"I got a pedicure here. Not bad, they were pretty thorough. But two days later both of my big toes were infected and oozing pus where she trimmed my toenails on the sides (which was weird anyway). I hate to rate a local shop down, but man my toes hurt."
0,"STAY AWAY, the owners are so rude, they blatantly say they are not doing well and then try to pretend they have the best hairdressers in Pittsburgh. they make you feel so unwelcome, advertise they offer a bunch of services and then when you ask they snap at you that they only do hair.  it was so awkward and weird .  i received warnings not to get my hair done there so i was going to get a pedicure because i had a gift certificate.  she told me her employees will only take cash if they have to touch a client's feet.  I may go there just to get bangs trimmed since i do not want to completely waste the certificate, but this place gives me the creeps, sounds dirty, and has beyond bad customer service.  They definitely do NOT know how to run a business and it is obvious why they are not doing well. Sue and Kristi pass the phone back and forth because noone wants to take a call.  she reiterates that the business is doing bad and they need more clients.  i have never experienced a ruder salon, or should i say dead beat shack."
0,"I think it is ridiculous that they say they need more clients!  I was all ready to be a new client.  I had a 12:30 appointment with them, and when I arrived at 12:30 on the dot, the place was locked and dark and no one was there!  I waited for five minutes (in the rain), and they still didn't show.  I called and left a voicemail saying that I was still willing to wait, and I understood if there was some confusion, but could they call my cell (I gave them the number, as I had previously given my home number when I made the appointment).  I waited nearby at a coffee shop, went back after another five minutes, and it was still locked and I hadn't received a call.  And I am definitely not estimating the time, either.  I was willing to wait a bit, and I looked very closely at the time on my phone to be sure that I wasn't jumping the gun on calling and then leaving.  Finally, I went on with my day and when I got home, they had left a voicemail on my HOME PHONE, which I had specifically asked them not to call, saying, \""Oh hi.  Sorry you missed me, but I was MAYBE two minutes late at the most.  I hope you haven't left, but you should just call back to reschedule.'  Seriously?  When I was waiting, another woman came to the door.  I thought she worked there, but she was just another client, also trying to get in!  When I told this story at another local business, the women there said that I was probably the fourth person who had had this same experience at this place.  I couldn't believe it.  This place is the worst, and I have never even stepped inside!"
0,"Now I'm picky about my hair, but Mane Attractions was so bad that I walked out after about 15 minutes of watching the stylists work on other clients.\n\nI had desperately needed a haircut and walked in for a major trim and re-shaping of my layers.  First, the girl at the counter said my hair might be \""difficult\"" due to the length (it was nearly long enough to sit on at the time) and that I would probably have to stand while it was cut.  Weird, but okay.  Second, no one there knew anything about donating to \""Locks of Love,\"" and I feel like salons should be aware of things like that.  I needed a cut so I went for it anyway.\n\nI watched the two stylists while I waited for my turn.  One stylist told the client whose hair she was cutting that she was going to do something other than what they discussed because it \""wasn't looking right.\""  Ummm, okay.  The other stylist was too busy checking her phone every three seconds to notice she was yanking on her client's hair so hard with the comb that she was giving her poor client whiplash.\n\nAt that point, I just pretended like I had received an urgent text and said, \""I have to leave, so sorry \""as I bolted for the door."

0,"I cannot imagine a more miserable place to shop than this jam-packed monstrosity.  This is a store that makes me thankful for Goodwill and The Salvation Army resale stores.  The customers and the staff are miserable at Red White and Blue.  The clothes are priced far higher than other such shops.  Merchandise is not refundable or exchangeable, and there are no fitting rooms!  One purchases clothes at their own risk!  What person would buy a suit under these conditions, hoping the pants will fit?  Unlike other stores, there is no senior discount and no credit cards accepted, a rare cash only business.  To the reviewer who boasts that everything is 50% off every day, how is that a sale?  It is bogus pricing.  Red White and Blue, uggh!"
0,"Love the store. Great stuff, High price. Buyer BEWARE of the RUDE cashier SYLVIA, extremely unpleasant, unwilling to help and always with NEGATIVE attitude.

0,This place is overpriced and the service is not good at all.  When we where there children were riding bikes in the lot near the tables.  One almost hit our child.  Another customer said that if the owner had been there she would have not allowed the bikes to be there.  The cone was large to say the least but the taste left something to be desired.  Not the best neighborhood either with a bar nearby.  Our children were exposed to language that would have made a sailor blush.  We will not be back.  Also they will accept a credit card but not a debit card?????  Please get up with the times.
0,"I had a very unfortunate experience with this groomer. My dog  was not groomed to my specifications; infact she was butchered. I went to the trouble of taking a photo of my dog with  the haircut that I wanted, as well as speaking with the woman who assured me she would be grooming my dog. The owner groomed my dog, not the woman that I spoke with and she looked nothing like my dog when I picked her up. The owner was rude and did not even apologize for the horrible service. Do not take your dog there to be groomed!"
0,"They made my Portuguese Water Dog look horrible. \n\nThey actually sheared all the fur from my dog claiming that it was matted and therefore they had no choice. This isn't true as I personally brush my dog every morning. When I complained, the owner said: \""But we did tell you that we will cut the dog's fur short.\""  Yes, they did, and I thought that considering that the days are hot in August, they are proposing a little cooler grooming. I never expected them to just shear the dog to the skin. \nI think they did it because they are hopelessly irresponsible. Although they charged $70 for this brutally simple operation they have not even trimmed dog's ears and tail. Consequently, the dog has disproportionally long hair on its tail and the ears. \nI used Animal Elegance for more than a decade. Long before current management took over. Over all these years I sometimes took in stride their accessional compromise of standards and always paid their exorbitant prices without complaint. However, this fragrant negligence, combined with their total disregard of the fact that I was an old and loyal customer did it. I will avoid this place from now on and would like to suggest that you do the same."
0,"I've been told several times that this place had a great brunch.  Upon arrival, the menu was very limited and the service was abysmal despite a nearly empty restaurant.  We literally waited 15 mins. at our table and then left prior to ordering."
0,The food here is ok but not worth the price. $15 corking fee? $9 a glass of garbage wine? Me thinks not.\n\nWhat really tops it off is the owner is beyond rude and doesn't care about the business. I heard it used to be much better but now I don't know anyone who eats there...
0,"I went to Pino's with my three other friends for Restaurant Week and was underwhelmed and completely disappointed. We chose an option for each course of  the very limited Restaurant Week menu. I selected the baked eggplant caprese appetizer, Lazy Man lasagna Florentine and then the panna cotta for dessert. \n\nBaked eggplant caprese: the breaded eggplant was a soggy mess. \nLazy Man Lasagna Florentine: it was essentially two huge lasagna noodles sandwiching huge clumps of spinach (I'm talking like a 3-inch high pile of clumped spinach) with a few mushrooms peppered in. The spinach ratio was out of control and I honestly ate a few bites and couldn't even continue. \nPanna cotta: this was the most decent of the items we ordered.\n\nMy friend ordered off the regular menu, which she advised not to do since her food would come out at a different time?? Why? \nWe tried my friend's appetizer of the Italian Fries, which are described on the menu as sounding very similar to the amazing fries at Point Brugge...but it was just a bowl of regular French fries, which were lackluster and misleading. She also got the house soup with chickpeas and it looked like Spaghetti-o's and tasted even worse.\n\nI don't know where all the positive reviews are coming from. There was not one thing we ate that was impressive in any way. All of it was overpriced and below mediocre. I wasted my money, and I will never, ever go back there."
0,"I went to Pino's recently, only to be disappointed by the owner himself. I guess I should have read the reviews on here before going, seeing as a lot of people echo the sentiments that I feel.\n\nAfter my mother sent back her extremely oversalted steak, the chef came out to \""apologize\"". It was very embarrassing how he chastised her for not enjoying her meal. He then snidely commented, as walking away, that he would \""never salt his steak again\"". I don't really take kindly to people speaking so rudely to my mother. She was very polite about sending it back and certainly didn't deserve any attitude. We had an event to attend, which we were very clear with to our waitress. So when my mother reordered another meal (a salad), which took another twenty minutes, my mom asked for it to be immediately wrapped up. The chef returned, obviously chewing to make a point, and sneered at my mother, announcing her steak that she refused to eat was actually quiet good. Well, I have never felt more embarrassed in a situation. I said he was being rude to my mother, a paying customer. He proceeded to get heated and tell me it was not his job to make people happy (!??!) and that everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal and we just had to get to the inside of the steak to appreciate it. \n\nThe drama continued when he did not have change for $100 for a $57 bill. Sorry, how can you not have $33 in change?! He ended the night by throwing our bill in a crumbled mess on the floor and walking out. \n\nOverall, embarrassing. It was an embarrassing situation for anyone to witness. Take heed of the negative comments on this site. I certainly wish I would have."
0,"Very disappointing meal.  After waiting for a half hour, my meal arrived and we were told that my friend's meal would be coming in a few minutes. Very awkward.t.  Salad was average at best.  The beets tasted like canned beets and the chicken was covered with blackish oil from a burnt oil pan.\n\n  Then, to make matters worse the chef came out to argue with a patron who returned her food.  The chef came out to humiliate the customer explaining that her returned steak was great and himself was enjoying it.  Eating food from a customers plate was a real turn-off....what else does he do when cooking? \n\nTo make matters worse, when paying the bill, the chef did not have change for a $100 bill for the customer who returned her steak..  It was very uncomfortable watching the elderly customer and her young friend deal with the situation. He kept  loudly requesting a credit card  and the women did not have one.   Another customer provided them with change as the chef crumbled the check. I think I would have just left and not paid....give the lady great for dealing with such a lunatic.\n\nLong story short....if you want to eat below average food and watch a chef loose it....this is your place!"
0,"This was the place I brought friends visiting from out of town when I wanted to show them the classy Italian  spots in Pittsburgh. After my visit last night, I have no desire to ever go again. \n\nI don't know the owner, Joe, personally but he has stopped by our table a few times and said \""dish looks beautiful.\"" He was always confident in his food which I guess is a good thing if the good is delicious,  which it usually is  \n\nThe table next to ours had a two women, a mother and daughter. The mother asked the server for a new steak as hers was a bit salty (I've never had the steak as I'm vegetarian but my guests have mentioned the abundance of salt). The server apologizes and returns to the kitchen. The owner comes out and fakes an apology claiming his steaks are perfect. At this point the whole restaurant is listening it's that crazy.  The  best part? He comes out again and says \""I really enjoyed the steak you sent back.\"" He was eating the steak and had some in his mouth! I can't make stuff like this up!\nAt this point the whole place feels bad for the mother and daughter. Clearly an awkward situation. The owner got so nasty the daughter tried to reason with him and he said \""it's not my job to make people happy\"" that's strange considering he wants our business. \nSo the mother tries to pay the bill with a $100 and leave but he said they can't make change. Eventually another customer helps make change and they leave.\n\nI couldn't finish my dinner I was so mad.  Maybe Joe was having a bad day but there is no excuse for how he treated those customers.  Sorry, we will never step foot in here again."

If they are not available, do NOT risk going.\n\nAlso, the Supercuts Oakland location is horrible at waxing eyebrows unless you are lucky to get the only woman of color there.\n\nWhile it was a $20 cut (after the 20% tip), I know had to buy biotin to grow my hair faster so it is more expensive to me in the end. I hope this proves helpful to all perspective customers!"

0,"We were visiting from out of town and just spent 6 hours driving. Found this place, read reviews on Yelp which were OK, and decided to ordered two slices. Hum...sorry not slices. More like two squares of cheesy bread. When we said these aren't slices, the lady at the register looked confused as though pizzas always look like that. We obviously aren't locals by the way we were dressed so the lady (who talked terribly) should have notified us when we first ordered it! They also have pictures of real pizzas on the wall -_-\nIt also took a really long time to cook those little things because they weren't pizzas. Since I was so hungry, i ordered another square of unhappiness and it was handed to me in the cooking wrapper not a paper plate, ugh. Definitely never going there if we come to visit again!"
0,"Horrible Food don't waste your money\n\nThis is the worse cardboard covered cheese & sauce so called pizza I've ever had, I haven't had this garbage since grade school cafeteria food, Most of the reviews on here rant about what a great place this is how much fun you'll have there. IDK where that place is cuz the one I wan in today in East Liberty by the Home Depot was getto beyond belief the food is bad & the people aren't nice & friendly.\n\nLoudness is an issue there when the lottery area has a sign saying because of back round noise your number may be wrong. Not one person there had decent customer service skills I had to ask the girl 3 times to speak up and I have excellent hearing. I ordered a small pizza I got a medium that was greasy on top but the crust was stale. \n\nI looked forward to getting some great pizza man this place really disappointed me today."
0,"This place has the worst service I've ever seen. I called in two cold sandwiches and was told it would be 15 mins.

Um, okay...then walk over and get it so i can pay for it! So I waited and waited as people who came in long after me got their orders. The \""workers\"" just stand around and spend more time talking to the regulars and trying to act like they are a big deal. I had to leave without my order after 40 minutes. DO NOT GO HERE!"
0,"Please do not adopt any pets from here until they update their standards.  I hate to think of animals living in cages, but...\n\n!! At least two cats adopted from here in September have diagnosed with the herpes virus by the vet, and this is contagious to other cats. !!\n\nAKA, it is likely that the shelter staff is not washing hands between handling pets and they are not testing for a virus that can be fatal in kittens.\n\nI recently adopted a kitten from their shelter--I picked him up from their Pittsburgh Public Market adoption station.  I was told that he had been tested for common feline viruses and up-to-date on vaccinations.  These were both untrue statements.  The kitten has the herpes virus and was not vaccinated against this.  My roommate, who was with me, and I were warned about the upper respiratory infection (URI) that can occur because of this virus and others, but we were not told that he was neither tested nor vaccinated for the herpes virus.  They gave me a paper with his vaccinations, but it was in vet-speak, so I took their word for it. \n\nFurthermore, the shelter staff put my kitten in my roommate's name mistakenly (and claimed that if we just called in that they would fix this mistake, but then wouldn't), so when he got sick, no one from their clinic would return my calls--I'm guessing this was since I wasn't the owner according to their records.  I had to email them to get a response, which basically said sorry that we didn't return your calls but this is your problem now.  They never apologized for the kitten's health or asked if he was feeling better.  Where's the compassion for the animal?\n\nSo now I have a very sick kitten on my hands.  I took him to the Big Easy in Lawrenceville when he stopped eating, and Dr. Ruiz is the best.  She took care of him, but it cost $160 to treat the virus he picked up at the shelter.\n\nThe Animal Rescue League shelter/clinic said that it does not and will not cover expenses for this.  After I had already taken him elsewhere, the clinic staff said that they would have given me a discount if I had waited two days to go to their clinic, but who would wait two days while the kitten wouldn't eat??  And now this virus makes him ineligible for pet insurance.  It  will cost hundreds of extra dollars a year to keep him healthy. \n\nHad I not fallen in love with the little monster, I would have taken him back to another shelter.  That's what the person who adopted the other kitten with virus did.  Whenever he gets an outbreak, he will get another URI.  This means a lethargic cat who sneezes, gags, and coughs because he can't breathe and who won't eat because he's too congested to smell his food.  It's very sad--protect your cats with the herpes vaccination, please!\n\nOh, and in case you were wondering: just like in humans, cat herpes is fo' life.  Poor little guy.  This also ruins my plan of getting another cat in the future.  Bad shelter!"
0,"Staff members here have always come up short. A past kennel worker  sold his litter of pit bull puppies in east liberty and the shelter was made aware of it  but excused it. \n\nThey will lie to surrendering families because they don't  want the cold hard truth, the good, bad and the ugly to leak out to the public. They lie ! \nThey kill many many animals because of a very subjective behavioral test that their dog hating staff performs .\n\nThey kill more pets for space than any other pittsburgh shelter.\n\nMany volunteers walk on eggshells here because they know an animals life is hanging in the balance and they are afraid to speak up or not allowed back in to volunteer . \n\nWeak leadership.

0,"This is a terrible shelter.  It appears that they routinely turn away (or kill, unless you state you will take them back) cats because they are \""overcrowded.\""  They will tell you that your cat has a \"" behavioral issue\"" to address turning said animal away.

0,"Never again. Let me repeat, never again. \n\nThe primary reason I used to visit this store was to fill medical prescriptions. Due to their repeated inability and ineptness in fulfilling simple requests, I cannot continue to patronize this store.\n\nWalking into the store, you are given the stink-eye by a minimum wage security guard, which automatically gives you as a customer the warm and fuzzy \""guilty-until-proven guilty\"" feeling a shoplifter would get, which is what this store assumes everyone is based upon their decision to lock up the mouthwash and shampoo.\n\nThe pharmacy seems to be staffed by high school interns.  They have no concept of customer service, nor do they display any attention to detail, which is quite frankly frightening in a pharmacy.  I really think my chihuahua would make a better pharmacist than the people who work here - my chihuahua lick you to death before you got your prescriptions, but at least you'd get greeted when you approach the counter, and you'd get what you ask for.\n\nThe first mishap was when my wife and I changed prescription insurance providers.  i handed wanna-be pharmacist #1 my new insurance card.  After spending about 5 minutes staring into a computer screen behind the counter, he assured me that they had my insurance information in the computer.  I then returned in the following days to fill a prescription, trusting in what wanna-be pharmacist #1 had told me in the days prior.  When I went to check out the bill came to over $300, which I chalked up \""maybe I have to meet a deductible before the coverage kicks in.\""  Upon further research, we discovered that wanna-be pharmacist #1 had NOT updated my insurance information and had run the numerous prescriptions I filled under my old insurance.\n\nThe latest of many \""adventures\"" involved my wife calling in a prescription refill.  We stopped to pick it up on the way home from work, only to be told when we arrived that the insurance won't cover the refill until tomorrow.  Again, she CALLED and SPOKE to one of them to refill the prescription before showing up.  I guess it's too much to ask to TELL someone you're speaking to on the phone that they need to wait a day for the insurance to work before coming into a ghetto pharmacy to not pick up a prescription.  But hey, at least wanna-be pharmacist #2 behind the counter was dressed like a stripper, which gave me and my wife some comic relief for the moment.  \n\nWe then returned the following day to (again) pick up the prescription we called to have refilled 2 days prior.  We were first told by wanna-be pharmacist #3 that there weren't any prescriptions waiting for us.  After searching around for a few minutes, they \""found\"" my wife's prescription refill, but it would take 10 minutes to be ready.  Yes, the prescription that we tried to pick up yesterday would need another 10 minutes to be prepared.  Hence, I am now here, writing this review.\n\nNever, ever again."

0,"I was just there this morning for a 10am appointment to get my summer tires swapped out for my winter tires.  My regular mechanic was overbooked and there is snow coming on Monday.  Receptionist scheduled me in just fine and the quoted price was reasonable, so I said OK.  Upon arrival, store manager stated that they will not touch the car as it has aftermarket rims and lug nuts.  He did not state any restrictions about aftermarket parts as they could not guarantee the work.  I asked if this was the case for all rims and he became a little snotty.  I had heart surgery a while back and I can't do the jack and tire work as not to tear at my incision/breastplate, if this was not the case with my health, I'd certainly take care of it.  Aftermarket rims are common - should not be an issue.  Last time I ever set foot in that place."
0,"Poor service that leaves tenants to fight mildew on their own. When asked to repair something, Rockwel Realty will do it on their terms and refuse to give you notice of when they will enter your apartment despite multiple requests\n\nWhen asked to clean mildew, they did in fact clean it with bleach while also spilling bleach on my sheets and ruining them. When told about this problem and that the mildew returned they said it was my fault for not turning the heat up and that damage done during service is an inherent risk the tenant is responsible for and nothing could be done. Their solution was for me to clean the mildew instead of properly insulating the unit to prevent mildew. \n\nThe entire building also has severe electrical problems that causes all lights to be replaced twice a month. No permanent fixes are made to existing units, but there is constant construction to expand an old building so they can collect more rent."
0,"Exceptionally poor maintenance service. They refused to start heat before mid-October and the centrally heated apartment grew very chilly as Fall progressed. On another occasion, they refused to change a rusted and weak lock. The lock eventually gave way and I locked myself into the bathroom. After the incident, I requested that the lock be changed immediately, and one of the owners threatened saying that we were in default of our lease agreement for not keeping our apartment as clean as when it had been leased to us. Dealing with Rocco and Elisabeth is nice, but good luck getting anything done with Nick who seems to be increasingly handling the operations of Rockwel."
0,I'm a lawyer in NY and I'm visiting a friend in Pittsburgh. I am blown away by the code violations in this unit. The tenants said they have reported these issues to the owner and to no avail. I am hoping to direct these tenants to a lawyer in PA.
0,"The people who work here are very rude. I have gone back a few times thinking it may have just been the person working that day was just a rude person, but no it happen every time. I am not a young hip person and felt very out of place there. It is like you are walking into someone's house and bothering them. The people working behind the counter act like you are interfering with there conversation. Plus it is very dirty. Perhaps the people working there should try cleaning the place instead of talking to each other. I will not go back again."
0,"This is the worst service (or worst non-service) I have ever experienced. Since I can't give zero stars, I'm giving the service one. We didn't eat anything so I can't comment on the food. \n\nMy husband and I went to Buffalo Blues last night. We stood at the empty hostess stand for a while. When no one came to seat us, and we couldn't find anyone to seat us, we seated ourselves figuring that's what we were supposed to do.\n\nThe bar was full, but not packed. There were only two other tables with guests, one of which had empty plates on the table during this entire experience. After what seemed like forever, my husband got up to find a server. He literally walked around the restaurant to find someone, but couldn't. He then tried to ask the bartender, but she was just as elusive. When he finally found a server,  she acted totally shocked that we were there. Maybe if someone had been doing their job, they wouldn't be surprised to find hungry people in a restaurant.\n\nShe came to our table, got our drinks (a soda and a water) and asked us if we were ready to order. When we said no she said she would be back. We could see her chit chatting with another server, but again, couldn't get her attention to come back to take our order. After another ten minutes of waiting for her to return, we put a few dollars on the table for my soda and we left. We ordered a pizza at a local shop and picked it up on our way home.\n\nTwenty-five minutes passed and we only get drinks? Such a waste of time. It took us 20 minutes just to make the drive there, 25 of waiting, and another 20 to get home. That's over an hour of our evening completely wasted which left us starving after a hard days work. I used to work as a server so I could understand if the place was busy and the staff was short handed, but it was basically a dead night table top wise. I will NEVER go back."
0,"I hate this place. I have been here many times and I am just finally getting around to writing a review.  Let me state that my wife made me go here tonight because my friends wanted to and she said I need to indulge their interests. Even if they suck. \n\nBuffalo Blues is like a Hooters, except the girls where more clothes and are not as good looking. The service is horrendous and the food may be better at Hooters.  The beer selection is decent at Buffalo Blues but it is expensive and they often run out of things that are still on the board.\n\nMy friends like going for all you can eat wing night but frankly I don't get it. You get 10 wings up front they will give more wings 5 at a time. The problem is that you get those wings in 30 minute intervals.  So the max you could eat is 55 wings. Did I mention that  the wings are really tiny and the sauce is tossed on like a Jackson Pollack painting.  They also charge extra for blue cheese or ranch.  The wings do not come with celery. This is a crime against humanity and the city of Buffalo.  \n\nI chose to detour from wings tonight and ordered a chicken sandwich. Apparently this was a bad choice.  It took a full hour to get my food. It was so long that the rest of the table ate their wings and ordered more and the waitress didn't think this was a problem. When my meal did arrive everything was cold. The sandwich was ok, but the fries were just tiny pieces that were limp and flavorless.\n\nI paid $16 for a beer and a sandwich that my friends had to wait for me to eat to leave.  I would say I won't go back, but apparently I like my friends more than I like good food and service."
0,"Went here this past Saturday afternoon, 11/2. My friends and I sat at the pretty much empty bar for over 5 minutes with no service. The bartender walked by us a few times and didn't even acknowledge we were there. As we walked out, we saw the bartender on the phone and other staff members standing in the back chatting. We went next door to Mad Mex and got much better service!"
0,"To be honest, I think this is one of the worst bars in the entire city.  The food was sub-par, even for bar food, the service was awful, especially during a game. I do enjoy a good sports bar, but I think the thing I hated most about this place was the other people that frequent there. It's the quintessential Shadyside bar, equipped with doughebag bros that went to the same fraternity in college and the Jersey Shore bimbos who pine for them. The last time that I went there were two guys throwing up outside of the bar on the sidewalk. I fully admit this is a subjective review, because this bar was obviously not my scene- but I still do not like this place at all."
0,"Unfortunately, the service we were given ruined our overall experience at Buffalo Blues. We sat down and put in our drink order.  My husband was excited about the amount of beers they had on tap. Fifteen minutes later and still without drinks, we saw our server trying to hunt the bartender down. Once the bartender finally started working on our drinks, she realized the keg for the beer my husband ordered was tapped. We were sitting at the booths right next to the bar but instead of the bartender just telling us so we could make another decision and get our drinks as soon as possible, she waited for the waitress to come back to tell her. Then, the waitress came back and did not apologize at all but simply said that he had to pick a different beer because they were out of that one. Anyway, long story short, it took way too long to get drinks and there was never any recognition from the staff of the issue. The restaurant seemed poorly managed and subpar. We will not be back."
0,"I've been to Buffalo Blues a few times at Happy Hour, and met my daughter there last night for Happy Hour specials as advertised on the web site.  First clue:  no Happy Hour promos mentioned in the bar except for the Yeungs and Wings (which was not what we were looking for).  We came close to leaving as my beer was off the draft list, but we decided to stay and were disappointed that my daughter's choice was already gone although still ilsted.  The food was awful, the service worse.  Maybe a busser should clean the table after removing the dirty dishes--our table was a sticky  mess.  The service:  one beer to the table at a time.  Next round I saw two beers go to a three-top, removed and sent to the bar, poured out and the glasses refilled and brought to us.  Someone else's food was brought to our table, our fries came out --lukewarm---but our wing order never went in.  So we got our garlic parm wings which tasted like old overcooked chicken and was way too crispy and greasy for my taste.  We ate two each, then told the server we didn't want them.  She offered to take them off, but we told her that wasn't necessary, so they took off 1/2 the price as a Customer service gesture.  Still, we had a Happy Hour bill for 1/2 eaten fries, barely touched wings, and 6 drafts total of $45 at a dirty table.  At least the place was quiet--there were empty tables everywhere.  I think we're done here."
0,"That is a great cat they have working, but they only have 3 brands of cat food, all of them expensive.  Funny enough though not as expensive as what I was looking for.  They followed me around like I was going to stuff my pockets and that just ruined the whole mom and pop thing."

0,Made an appointment for 3:30. They completely forgot I was coming but said they could start on my car in ten minutes and be done in an hour. Came back an hour later only to see my car in the same spot. They said it would take another two hours to start work. Completely unhelpful and unapologetic.
0,"I came in with a flat.  They said they couldn't repair the tire because there was cracking on the edges.  True there were cracks, but they were hairline cracks and superficial.  The diagnosis was done just from examining the exterior, which I discovered, is not sufficient to adequately judge if the cracking is bad enough--you have to actually take the tire off.\n\nCoincidentally, all four tires had the light cracking and therefore all four tires would probably need replacing.  Hmmm....  How convenient for Monro?\n\nWell, even if I give them the benefit of the doubt on the tire cracking, the pricing on the tires was ridiculous.  My tires, which were under warranty, would have cost over $500 to get replaced with crap tires (that's with the warranty credit applied).  Oh but wait, they could make me a deal with some in-house tires that were even crappier for $480.  How did I know they were crappy?  I looked them up online.  Guess what else I found.  Both sets of tires were significantly cheaper according to the Manufacturer's website even when including installation, balancing, and disposal!  \n\nSo no, no thank you.  I don't want to pay $500 to get cheap tires on my car.\n\nFortunately, my tire would hold air for a few hours so I drove to another place.  They fixed the flat no problem for $20.  Guess that cracking wasn't so bad after all."
0,"I came in here to have a diagnosis done on my car because the ABS light was on. \nThey removed all the tires, showed me how the sensor and ABS work, did not perform the diagnosis I originally went in for and told me that I should have the back wheel hubs replaced for a total of $1,222, this with a new set of breaks (that I knew about) and \""without\"" charging me labor. \nI may not know much about cars but I know how to search the internet and ask for advice. I found the cost of wheel hubs, they are no more than $150 each (for my car) and here they said that they cost $550 each (before labor). \n\nI also found out that the sensors get so soiled from all the dirt and salt that most of the time all the car needs is a simple wash on the undercarriage. You should always have your car washed, specially in the winter. It may save you $100's.\n\nThis place will rob you blind.\n\nNever have work done in a place like this until you do your homework!"
0,"I took a subaru outback here for the annual state safety and emissions inspections.  First I was charged more for this service than what was clearly posted on the service station wall.  Secondly I was failed for a lug nut that had rusted to the point that the technicians could not get it off.   I was quoted $425 for them to get it off.  I was able to accomplish this with a $6 bottle of penetrating oil and a breaker bar.  \n\nWhen I returned to have the reinspection I was charged for it (their policy posted on the service wall clearly states you get a second inspection within 30 days of initially failing free of charge).  This time they were able to get the lug nut off but supposedly could not get it back on.  This was odd as I had taken it off and put it back on numerous times to ensure it was okay to pass.  They once again quoted me $425, stating they would have to replace the wheel stud.  The new wheel stud cost me $3.50 at the local parts store and I did the job in under an hour without a single power tool.  \n\nThis shop is not following the guidelines they have clearly posted on their wall and are fabricating problems in an effort to overcharge you for simple repairs.  Avoid this shop."
0,"Have taken my car here a few times because there's a bus stop out front so it's convenient to drop my car off and get to work. But after what happened I will never be back. They just cost me money and lost my tires. \n\nIn March I blew a tire on a pothole (naturally) and they replaced the two front tires for me. The second tire was fine but you have to replace both, I kept it so that I would have a spare if another one blew out. Put the tires in my basement, no problem. Saved for a rainy day. \n\nThis week I ran over a nail and the tire wasn't fixable so I had to get it replaced. Luckily I've got a spare! I called Monro early this morning to see if I could get in but they said it would be tomorrow at the earliest. I needed my car so I took it to pep boys (three hour turnaround - also the last time I needed an oil change they said they were booked for three days, good lord). \n\nI drop the car off at Pep Boys and tell them the extra tire is in the back. They call me up and tell me the tire is the wrong size. What? Monro gave me the wrong tires back when they replaced them in March. So I had to buy a new tire when I had a perfectly good one that is now god knows where. The tire was the wrong size and definitely didn't come from my car as it wouldn't have fit on the rim. \n\nAfter paying for the tire at Pep Boys I went over to Monro to see what they would do about it. They informed me that because I already had the new tire put on they couldn't do anything but the next time I came in they \""would work with me\"". Why the hell would I come back when you just screwed me out of a hundred bucks and a good tire? Not worth chancing. Because you couldn't fit me in within a day I get screwed? \n\nIf you need tires go to Pep Boys on Milvalle. If you need an oil change go to Midas on Penn Circle they'll be able to get you in and not wait three days."

I was then treated to a relaxing 15 minute wait as nobody moved in line. Perhaps it was the clientele, a 1992 minivan filled with some savvy locals. Perhaps it was the professional waitstaff, whom I could hear laughing and socializing through my window. Whatever it was, the dining experience was filled with culinary magic and spa-like service. After some deep meditation, I realized that perhaps tonight was not the best night to sample such fine delicacies so I pulled away. I cannot wait to return to this location and try my luck at trying these elusive fries. I highly recommend this palace of excellence."

When I unpacked the food and tried a sip of my soup, I found that it was cold and had bubbles in it, as if there was soap in it. I couldn't really taste anything, but my boyfriend said it smelled like dishwater. To say the least, I was disappointed in my soup. When my boyfriend cut into his calzone, he said the cheese was barely melted. We thought it was undercooked and touched the outside. It was cold, as if it was sitting out in the open for a long time. He tried to take a bite, but the dough was barely even cooked and the contents of the seafood calzone was cold and tasted sour.\nThis was our first time ordering from here and it was such a sad experience to have, since our food was inedible. I heard this place was good and had great calzones and tasty soup, but what we received was the complete opposite from the praise I've heard about this place."
0,"I was all set to want to give this place 3 stars simply because another laundry place put me in a bind and this place was open 24 hrs.  I thought the late hours alone should give it a star. Then I had this experience\n\n--Poor ventilation I could barely breath its cramped and small with dryers and washers lining two narrow corridors. \n\n---- misleading advertising it boasts \""high capacity\"" washers an says its air conditioned, well the air conditioners and vents in the ceiling both were dripping in black dust and look like they were installed in 1963. which might have been why I felt an instant asthma attack coming on. \n\nThen the high capacity washers were all of 2.... not great enough to meet demand as it turns out one girl took up both of them while I was waiting. Then another woman waited for hers to wash and took up two again this was at 1030-11:00  pm at night so I can only Imagine what its like to try and get one at other hours. \n\nThen there was this guy I guess he was an attendant or the owner, he was wiping down the machines and dryers. I was moving my clothes out of the dryer and I had put my bras hangers and a few shirts on top of my washer. I was literally loading right in the same area and was heading back to grab my things when he touched them!!\n\nUgh laundry violation ya don't touch someone's wet clothes it feels like that time in college when someone would mess with you and dump your clothes behind the washers if you didn't move them out quickly enough. Sooo that pissed me off...... but I have to get the job done so I load up my clothes. \n\nI come back in to check on drying clothes.... and what do I find but my dryer mysteriously switched from high heat to low heat. Now I am forced to put in another quarter to finish my load. All in all I spent 8$ at the econowash for 2 large loads I wasn't able to do my third load in the washers he had for under that.

I have never seen such expensive rice! Here is the bro-down...\n\nThe food: Plentiful and too expensive to even think of buying. The freshest fish that isn't in the Strip...but you need to take a second mortgage to buy fish for a family. I bought sushi rice, a piece of fish and a salad, my bill: $25! The salad with lettuce, carrots, chick peas, onions and about 5 pieces of chicken was $11+\n\nThe employees: Hipsters with thick-rimmed glasses, tattoos and facial piercings that slack like I have never seen \""workers\"" slack before. In fact there was a sign above some fresh fish stating \""We will prepare you fish any way you want, just ask\"" HA...HA! When I asked to have a tiny fish to be filleted (something that would take me about 10 seconds at home) I was scoffed at by the so called fish monger who was obviously not a trained fish monger, but got his job because of his Progressive music of the soviet era bachelors degree . It took him the better part of 20 minutes to fillet a f-ing fish! All I got was a chopped up piece of crap that was useless. And scoffing is what these people are good at. Pushing your cart down the aisles is like running a scoffing gauntlet. Staff huff and puff when you get in their way?! The cashiers just stand and talk to each other or run to get organic iced tea to drink WHILE they ring you up...they don't even do that at Giant Eagle!\n\nThe other customers: This one is a peach! If you're not pulling in a good $60K a year you are dirt to these people. I was at the salad bar (it is a good salad bar, but expensive) an older woman in a mink coat bumped, no, pushed into me then stared at me and turned her nose up at me, can you believe it? She actually turned her nose up at me! Others in the aisles will grunt like cantankerous old people if they can't get through. They push ahead in line, give you dirty looks, and act like it's a class struggle...it kind of is!\n\nSo unless you have a lot (i mean A LOT) of disposable income, have never needed to use coupons, drive a $50K car (parking is terrible there), are the president of the United States, CEO of Microsoft, a widow whose wardrobe is more extensive than the explanation of the formula explaining an event horizon or a hipster who looks poor, but lives off daddy and mommy (though they'll never admit it) you shouldn't and really won't be able to afford this place...but why would you want to?\n\nI'll stick with Trader Joe's for my alternative market, thank you!

Towed, not for leaving the parking lot, but for legitimately shopping at WF. Yes, this could happen to you too.\n\nUpon contacting the towing company, they demanded $135 (cash only) to return my vehicle. Upon contacting WF (since I was a legitimate shopper there and didn't leave the lot) they just shrugged their shoulders and just told me the name of the company that managed the lot.\n\nAnd that's it?! $135 is no chump change, but it seems like WF wants me to carry an extra $135 every time I frequent them (thankfully, never, since I don't live in Pittsburgh). This whole parking/towing situation is extremely shady, but the only company I'm going to point my finger at is Whole Foods for doing business with such a shady complex and passing the burden on to its customers.\n\nTip: Bring an extra $135 to pay for parking, or just go to Trader Joe's/Giant Eagle for a better parking/shopping experience."

Citing a mix of Mediterranean and Northern African influences with a bargain Piccola Gusto Menu for lunch and the option for indoor or al fresco dining it seemed as if Casbah was a can't miss option...well, sometimes things don't turn out quite as you expect - almost everything that transpired from the moment we arrived until the moment we left was a failure.\n\nWhen our server, a young woman named Amanda L who would prove quite inept and inefficient from start to finish, finally did arrive our menus were delivered with a brief hello before she wandered away - another server later stopped by to fill our water and drinks were never even offered.  When Amanda finally did return she was capable of answering a couple questions about portion size and our orders were placed.  With my mom and sister opting for the two-course Gusto lunch and myself choosing two courses a la carte we sat and sipped our water.\n\nWaiting approximately 10 minutes another ancillary server arrived with bread and butter - a light and airy white bread with a hefty crust paired with a sweet and salted cow's milk butter - decent, but nothing to write home about compared to the myriad bread options at Eleven.  After this point we would not see another staff member for 30 minutes...well, we would see them, they just wouldn't be walking anywhere near our table - instead bussing tables and running around while the hostess flirted with a man at the bar...I'll note that my water glass remained empty for greater than 15 minutes.\n\nFinished with our first courses approximately 10 minutes would pass - long enough for me to actively collect each and every plate and stack them at the empty seat of our four-top - before Amanda would finally return to collect the dirty plates...we'd not see her again until 15 minutes later when she filled our water glasses and told us our main courses would be \""right out.\""  While I guess she didn't define \""right out,\"" what this actually meant was \""in 25 minutes.\""  Starting first with my mother's combo - Jumbo Lump Crab, pepper bacon, avocado, radish sprouts, on a paesano bun and Orecchiette Pasta with grilled chicken, dried cranberries, Riverview Farms goat cheese, sage cream. While the sandwich may not be memorable, the pasta was actually quite impressive.  Using a less salty cheese and mild cream to flavor the al dente little ears of pasta worked wonders while the sweet/savory m\u00e9lange of craisins and grilled chicken were a nice match.\n\nVastly less well done than my mother's plate would be my sister's option - the Grilled Vegetables, portobello, zucchini, eggplant, arugula, chickpea hummus, on baguette and Maccheretto pasta with wild mushrooms, white beans, sun-dried tomatoes, rapini pesto, fontina, walnuts.  Beginning with the sandwich, the bite I had was good in taste but rather mushy in consistency - too many similar vegetable textures and the hummus spread too thickly.  Moving on to the pasta - we all tasted it, but I'm still not sure what we were supposed to be tasting - it tasted like watery cheese...no spice, no salt, and certainly nothing resembling pesto or tomatoes.  For the first time in the meal Amanda actually opted to check on us approximately 10 minutes into our main courses and when told of the watery pasta she did apologize and offered to replace it with something else - more Orcchiette.\n\nFor my main course I received a simple side salad-fresh greens, crispy onion strings, and a pleasant vinaigrette.  The salad, of course, was served alongside Elysian Fields Lamb \""Mac and Cheese\"", tubetti pasta, mascarpone, cheddar, Pecorino-Romano, and bread crumbs.  Piping hot and browned with crispy bread crumbs the dish was a decent Macaroni and Cheese, but honestly the lamb was so scarce and thinly cut that it added little.\n\nCompleting our mains approximately 110 minutes after entering Casbah we again waited nearly ten minutes before anyone would stop by to collect dirty plates-a different ancillary server this time.  With my mother and sister already deciding enough was enough they stood up to use the restroom before leaving-by the time Amanda would stop by to ask if anyone would care for dessert our two course meal had lasted 2:05 and I skipped on a menu entailing bread pudding, carrot cake, and panna cotta with \""just the bill.\""\n\nSettling the bill via credit card no tip was left because no tip was deserved - in reality Amanda may have actually be the worst server I've encountered at a fine dining establishment in the last 2 years.  I will note that when I wrote to Big Burrito was met by a (seemingly) sincere apology without excuses - the Manager stated things don't' normally happen like that and he'd be sure the issue was addressed.  He closed with \""I hope you will join us again.\"" I will not."
0,"Not a good vegan experience.  We were meeting friends at Casbah for dinner -their choice.  Since I follow a version of vegan, I called ahead and was assured that they had vegan versions of a couple of pasta dishes.  Server was very cooperative and said she would instruct the kitchen to omit the meat and  increase the veggies on their cavatelli.   Well, they omitted the meat, but I was left with one of the smallest servings of pasta that I have ever seen.  At about $20, it was close to the price of caviar!"
0,"Three strikes and you're out!  We had brunch there a few months back, and the meal was so salty that we could barely begin to eat it.  That meal was comped and I figured it was an off day.  We went back about a month later for dinner, and that meal was also very salty and we could not finish it.  We were willing to try again, so we went for dinner tonight.  I ordered the filet, and it was like eating a salt shaker.  I was shocked that, for a third time, I had a piss poor meal at Casbah.  I sent that back, and ordered the sea bass.  When I got to the end of the piece of fish, it was raw.  Needless to say, I will NEVER return to this restaurant.  Looking back, what should I have expected from the sister restaurant of Mad Mex?"
0,"I must be a glutton for punishment, because I keep finding myself hungrily returning to the Quiet Storm. The menu has slightly changed, and they are no longer cash only... This time it was the \""8th Ward\"" that inflicted extreme disappointment. Not sure what 8th Ward is supposed to mean, but I will forever associate it with a dry boring place. And I thought we were getting a party platter! This appetizer sampler included THE WORST hummus evaar; I am near positive that they forgot to add garlic, lemon, salt and tahini to this chickpea paste that which was described as \""garlicky\"" on the menu. Sooo wrong. \""The Butter,\"" another WTF of a name, was also very dry and bland. The salsa was good! And there were plenty of dipping accessories, too many really, given the smallness of the unappetizing dip portions.\n\nAt this point, I've tried most of the vegan options QS has to offer and the only luck I've had has been with the B.Y.O.B. Go figure. \n\nI wouldn't care so much about how much of a tease this place is if I didn't REALLY desire a comfortable neighborhood place to eat comfortable food with a comfortable view of a cute waitress who writes fiction. And it frustrates me that few others seem to recognize the culinary (I shutter at even calling it that) mediocrity of \""the best\"" vegetarian restaurant Pittsburgh has to offer."
0,"Well, I think Heidi S. pretty much covered all of the bases here. The lemon-ginger tea that I ordered was weak, perhaps not steeped hot enough? The hummus, wow, definitely the worst; tasted like paste. Yuck with a capital whY. I considered giving two stars because the service and atmosphere were pleasant, but since I do not plan to return, I guess methinks not."
0,"I'm a vegetarian and have lived behind the restaurant for over 3 years. Every time I have ever gone, the service is awful. It's as if they're doing you a favor by waiting on you. I think their breakfasts are pretty good and their lentil loaf is good but usually your sides consist of yellow nacho chips with brown jalopeno slaw. Also, the cooks look like they are lacking hygeine. the one great thing about this place is their coffee, and that's it."
0,"Yes, it is reasonably priced.  Yes, my food was tasty (6 on a scale of 1-10).  However, the place did not look clean to me--I won't be back because of that."
0,"Ugh... I got a plate with seisage, tofu scramble, and sundried tomato toast. My whole plate was entirely dry, chewy, and unpalatable. I had high hopes for the tofu scramble, especially after seeing positive reviews about it. But honestly... It tasted like nothing. I thought it'd be moister with a creamy consistency that might come from silken tofu, but it was hard, dry, and chewy. Hubby got a country burrito that was much better in comparison to my plate... But that might have been due to the fact that his whole plate was doused in gravy. Anything will taste better drenched in gravy. We think the gravy tastes like the powdered packet kind where you just add water. On top of all this service wasn't the greatest. I had to fish around for my own ketchup and they didn't even bother to ask me what kind of toast (3 options on the menu)I wanted when I ordered the toast option for my meal. Then they didn't bother to ask hubby if he wanted anything to drink after he had picked one of the $12 entrees that come with coffee or juice. We had to tell someone else to get it for us. Also they don't really wash their cups. There are 2 sink basins at the front where they just dunk the cups in one soapy basin then dunk the cups in a second water basin and then stack them next to the sink. It made me not want to drink my water even though I was thirsty. Good idea, but poorly executed food. I've had good vegan and vegetarian food before that's consisted of a lot of fresh greens, avocados, and more. For a vegetarian place, there was nothing green on our plates. This experience sadly fell enormously short of our expectations... Could've eaten at kaya or meat and potatoes for the same price."
0,"Worst tofu scramble ever. Days old, cold, hard, inedible.  Sent it back and had no time to wait for another dish. I can't even believe that the server, let alone the  \""chef\"" thought it appropriate to serve. \n\nBrought my 2 year old along, had to get a high chair, I'm able to do this just would have been nice if asked by server if we needed one."
0,"I was pretty disappointed with this place. I thought from the good reviews that the pizza would taste okay. I went here around 12am on a Friday so maybe their ingredients weren't as fresh. I ordered a medium veggie pizza with a side of fries. The fries were super soggy and the pizza was pretty flavorless. There are only about 2 seats inside so you pretty much have to take it to go which was fine with me. \n\nThe people working there are really nice though which is a plus. Overall, i wouldn't go back."
0,"They have inaccurate hours posted. I tried to order at 11:30 pm when yelp says they close at 2am and they were already closed. When I told them they have inaccurate hours posted the guy on the phone said \""oh that's ok....\"" And hung up on me. I will never be ordering from them again, which is a shame since they are so close to me. I immediately called Pizza Parma which gladly delivered to me. I recommend ordering from Pizza Parma since they have similar menu items, they post accurate hours, and they don't hang up on you! Seriously? Why answer the phone?"
0,"The vet met with us for a very short amount of time. She was rushed, seemed distracted, and was abrupt. She very quickly said that it seemed like SCC, or oral cancer, and that there was no cure and the prognosis wasn't good. She left the room seconds after and only came back in to say that they would get blood work and schedule a biopsy. After she said she thought it was SCC, she didn't give us a chance to ask questions or respond. \n\nThe technician didn't have any demeanor with our cat, nor with us as clients. She seemed tired, and overworked.\n\nAll in all, this was a negative experience. I recommend that you take your pets to another vet :("
0,"The blonde woman who tuns the gym was extremely rude to us. First time we went she refused yo.get off the phone on a personal call to help us. Then she gave us the rules for the bouldering area in a rapid bored monotone. Compared to other climbing gyms I have gone to this gym is less safe (no gri-gris), unfriendly, and more expensive. Definitely not worth it. Worst customer service I've seen in a while."
0,"Pros:\n- At least there's a climbing gym in this area\n- Walls get reset often\n\nCons:\n- I've been coming here a couple times a week for the past few months now, and I have felt like some of the walls really need some padding besides the not-so-great spring board they have. The walls are pretty high and the height + lack of mats retract me from climbing certain routes, which is really disappointing because it ruins my climbing experience. \n- I brought up the aforementioned lack of mats to the woman who works here, and she snapped at me: \""Mats are only supposed to be under walls that are sloped.\"" I told her the wall I was talking about was sloped, and she replied curtly \""If you don't feel comfortable climbing those walls without a mat, then you shouldn't even be climbing them.\"" I was in shock. Is this a way you should be addressing your climbers' legitimate concerns? Even if it isn't possible to have mats, she could have at least told me in a nicer way instead of talking to me as if I knew nothing. \n- The gym closes at 11PM on Fridays. I usually go at night until they close, but the staff passive aggressively starts turning off the gym lights around 10:50PM. I get it, it's a Friday night and you want to get outta here. But the business hours are until 11PM, so let me enjoy my last ten minutes of climbing because I am paying for my climbing membership and I want to get as much climbing as I can get out of my sessions at the gym. \n- The holds are old and covered in rubber from the shoes. It would be nice if they could at least pressure wash them every once in a while. \n- The fees are unreasonable for the customer experience we get here."
0,"I was home for the holidays and wanted to take some friends of mine climbing.  They've never belayed and don't have equipment so my hope was that we could go, I could test out of the belay class and we could top rope some easy climbs.\n\nDreams crushed.  Only people that are belay certified can even be in the top rope room.  I would've had to pay $5 to test out of the certification and even if my friends wanted to take a quick lesson on how to belay, its only at very specific times and you need to give advanced notice.\n\nSo we bouldered.  The walls are old, made of smooth plywood and though the walls are a good variety, you eventually end up right on top of one another.  You can only top out on one tiny section, everything else backs right up to another wall or and abyss.  With someone who isn't super comfortable down climbing or jumping from the top, I wasn't always super excited to fall when there wasn't a nice big cushion.  Those were only on the overhanging walls.\n\nThe place was super busy on a Sunday afternoon and group after group rolled in.  I understood why there were so many VB and VB+ routes (easier than V0's).\n\nSide note: cubbies are completely separate from the bouldering area and no food or drinks are allowed inside the bouldering area.  Therefore your water stays in your cubby, plan carefully.\n\nI expected better from Pittsburgh and heard that there is a new gym coming, so I'll be waiting for that one before I try to climb again in da burgh."
0,Don't go. I got more problems and sounds on my car after I spent $800 there. unbelievable!
0,"This place is looking to make money and rip you off.  The door of my car had a dent in it for over three years when I took it here for my annual inspection.  Never before did anywhere else have a problem with it, but this place said they would not pass it.  Weird how it passed inspection 3 times already with no other place mentioning the door being a problem.  Never giving this place any business again, I went to a different Meineke in Homestead where they are helpful and work with you."
0,"I've eaten here once after having it suggested by numerous people, I was totally disappointed with the service, food, and the place itself, I will not be headed back......ever\nSave your money, or starve either would be a better option"
0,"This was the first time for me and my wife at the celebrated Cafe Zinho. Parking in the residential area in which the restaurant is located is next to impossible on a busy Saturday night; the diner should be prepared to walk a distance to get to the restaurant from where he or she is ultimately able to park.  The greatest drawback is that the restaurant is tiny and the seating so tight that at our table, it was necessary to sit uncomfortably in order to avoid being bumped by anyone that walked by, which happened repeatedly as we were in a busy thoroughfare of food delivery.  No other table offered a much better situation and all others were occupied at the busy time we arrived, 6:45 p. m. The online menu boasts of a daily vegetarian and vegan special entree, but there was no such entree on this night.  There was only one non-meat item on the small menu, ravioli.  Our gracious server, Ramon, said that the kitchen could prepare a couscous and vegetable dish if the vegetarian in our party wanted it, and that was what we did.  The restaurant permits customers to bring their own alcoholic beverages, a nice convenience and savings for the diner.  A small portion of bread was served with a tiny amount of rock-hard butter.  My mushroom and cheese soup was a large portion, served piping hot, which was great, but it was a puree with no distinct mushroom pieces.  I would not have been able to distinguish it as mushroom soup.  All of our entrees were attractively presented and were tasty, average size portions.  All were served with a small amount of good, fresh vegetables. It would be helpful if the menu offered some description of the following entree so that the diner with an interest in a chicken dish would not have to inquire about it of the server:  \""chicken maputo\nRoasted w/ piri piri & chocolate scented sauce\"".  Does the average diner know what \""maputo\"" and \""piri piri\"" are? The lemon tart dessert was a small piece not suitable for sharing, served with two minute pieces of strawberries and a small dollop of whipped cream.  It was not flavorful or moist nor worth the calories.  The gracious owner, Tony Pais, stopped at our table for a moment to greet us, a nice touch, and there were quality checks by a manager and Ramon.  I noticed a number of prominent people from the community dining here, individuals whom I was surprised were willing to spend a good deal of money to be packed into a sardine can of a restaurant.  Apparently they consider this to be the only restaurant in town.  The rest rooms are small, one-person facilities, naturally. An unfortunate surprise occurred when the individual that was picking up the check for my party presented his credit card only to be told that the restaurant accepts only cash and checks, this for a tariff of $148 plus gratuity.  It is supposed to be of some consolation that there is an Automatic Teller Machine on site.  I imagine less than 1% of expensive restaurants today are cash only.  Cafe Zinho is a highly flawed restaurant, demonstrating that there is more to a fine dining experience than simply offering fine cuisine.  If one is able to get beyond the feeling one has when visiting the rest room on a commercial airliner, the diner might enjoy it: not us.\n\nI posted comments about the restaurant at its Facebook page, in which I noted my displeasure with being cramped and uncomfortable, and about the restaurant being unique in its unwillingness to accept credit cards for a $148 check.  An individual identifying himself as the manager, who apparently had never received constructive criticism from anyone, initially demonstrated rage, posting a message that I can go to the Oiive Garden the next time I dine out.  He later added with similar condescension that I can use a coupon and a credit card at The Olive Garden.  Later, he thought better of his outburst and removed the comments...along with mine.  He ultimately offered me and my wife the opportunity to return to the restaurant at his expense.  I thanked him for the offer, but told him that one experience at Cafe Zinho was enough.  I had no intention of returning even if he had responded to my comments like a gentleman."
0,"My partner and I were visiting my family in Pittsburgh we live in San Diego. my partner was born and raised in Portugal. My mom heard about this resaurant and was excited to take my partner and I to a Portuguese restaurant in Pittsburgh. We went, looked at the menu and did not find anything Portuguese on the menu. Why does this restaurant promote itself as Portuguese, fly the Portuguese flag and not have ANY Portuguese dishes. We left."
0,"These people could not care less.\n\n I am still waiting for my washer dryer to get fixed -its been almost a month now and I am being told that they don't even know when the technician will return. The technician has been here 4 times already. Each time there is supposedly something else wrong and so they have to order another part. Miraculously the part is wrong (first week), They forgot to order the second part (2nd week), Part comes in but they need a suppossed other part and it will be \""another 3-5 days\""(3rd week), Fourth week rolls by and they \""don't know\"" when its coming in (thats up to the distributor). When I ask for an ETA (because I am wearing dirty clothes, and I am sick of technicians coming back 5 times and I already took off a week of work to meet these people) the cus.t service rep gets mad at me and offers me a refund. (The washer is on warranty) They obviously don't want to deal with any problems they created. So now I have to call the distributor to see when the part is coming in (yup,  thats YOUR job Appliance Service Center!)."
0,"Sadly, the professionalism of the front desk never got better.  Despite Emilio's assurances that changes were being made, my latest visit proved otherwise.  I called ahead and was assured that Marshall was on time...in fact, he didn't have an appointment ahead of mine and could take me as soon as I got there.  I was there a few minutes before my appointment.  I waited.  And waited.  Fifteen minutes later, I asked if Marshall knew I was waiting.  I was told by the brunette that they had been busy.  Odd, she, the blonde and two other employees had been standing there talking for a while.  She went back to notify Marshall.  When Marshall came up front to get me, the brunette admonished him that he should keep an eye out for his clients - she shouldn't have to notify him that his appointment is there.  Wow.  And the purpose of a receptionist is....what?  I'm done.  I'm out.  Apparently nothing will help Izzazu's but getting rid of the front desk staff.  \n\nOn a positive note, it was another great cut.  Not good enough to lure me back, though."
0,"I had an appointment that was made 2 months in advance and when I turned up they told me that the person I had the appointment with quit 6 weeks ago and they didn't have anyone available to take me. They made no attempt to reschedule me with someone else or call me to cancel. To make things worse, the battleax at the front desk had such an attitude. Here's a tip, when you are in the beauty salon business, staff the front desk with someone who looks like they have actually BEEN to a salon. Not with rude women that have hairdos from 20 years ago. Will never go back."
0,"Emailed and called several times to get a pricing on having several services done at once as a graduation present to myself. I was put on hold twice and never picked back up. Emails went unanswered.  :(\n\nI was going to have SO MUCH done, too!! Hair cut, color with highlights, spa manicure/pedicure and an hour massage!

0,"DO NOT BUY CLASSES FROM THIS BUSINESS: After attending a class in Pittsburgh, I purchased Okello's online courses. I did not receive a code for the classes in a timely manner and we agreed to a refund. It has now been months and he has not responded to any of my repeated attempts to contact him through Facebook, his website or the phone number listed. Especially after seeing that he is responding to questions about photos, I feel like this is extremely unprofessional and caution everyone from making purchases from him. Update: 3 1/2 months later, I have had to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau because I still can not get a response from this business. I see he has upcoming workshops and hope that others can see this before making a purchase. I wish I had been warned!"
0,"Unbelievable experience! Literally unbelievable. I waited 50 minutes and finally walked out. Receptionists were beyond awful. I booked 3 style appointments in advance for a wedding. One person was taken right away, 20 minutes later the second person was taken.  I WAITED 50 MINUTES while being ignored by the receptionists.  I can celled because the others were almost done and we would be running late. My stylist finally came out and said he'd quickly do my hair. What !! I'm not paying $100 to get rushed service. We were looking forward to a relaxing, fun experience. More unbelievable, I waited 20 minutes to pay for the two services. One receptionist couldn't take transactions and another was occupied with a wedding party.  I was so close to walking out and not paying. Unfortunately the two stylists didn't get a tip through no fault of their own. I can't give an unbiased opinion of their work as I am still furious in the way I was treated.  I would expect some ambiance at $100 for shampoo & style. I could never recommend Izzazu. Denham & Company is on Market Square, their rates are reasonable and within walking distance of the Fairmont. I am calling the concierge tomorrow informing her of my experience."
0,Horrible - they use chicken that's been out uncover all day . And they smoke around the food.:(
0,"The menu online gives no prices, and the entrees are ridiculously overpriced for what you get - a good meal, but far too much food, and nothing extraordinary. The entrees are $50 - $60. BE WARNED - if you want atmosphere to go with your $60 entree, you'd better REQUEST DOWNSTAIRS! Otherwise you can have your anniversary dinner in a small room in front of large televisions. Who knew? And the staff will definitely not accommodate your request for a more romantic spot - even if they know it is your tenth anniversary! Wow. Should have walked out."
0,"No better in taste than a Fazoli or even an Olive Garden.  Inflated prices, like the cheapest entree was $40, try to disguise this place as something it is not.  Went with a group of co workers, so we pretty much got everything on the menu and not one thing stuck out really good.  Service is incredibly slow.  Not worth it at all.  Even if you tell yourself that atleast the portions are large, the food is just not good enough to warrant wasting a meal eating there."
0,"The first time I went here was with a group - we had reserved the entire restaurant for a retirement party.   I had a horrible experience.  Vowed never to go back!  At that time, I even had a terrible interaction with the owner.\n\nThis time I was invited with a couple of girlfriends because they love it. Decided to try again since it was more about the \""get together\"" than the food/location.\n\nThis time, overpriced food and bad service.  Overall, it was not anything out of the ordinary and not worth the price.   I had the veal speciality.   Large portion, but ok.  Staff was not very attentive for the small amount of customers present.\n\nI am a Pittsburgh native.  This is a bad neighborhood. \n\nI am NOT interested in ever going back!"

0,"I'm in the market for a fun little scooter to have fun and commute on, and at the suggestion of a friend, I went to Bohn Cycle Shop to check out what they had in the shop. Immediately upon walking in, it took 15 minutes for someone to ask if we were helped. When I mentioned that I wanted to learn more about a Zuma over in the corner, the dude at the desk was disinterested and unhelpful.\n\nWhen I tried to pay for the scooter and roll it out, an older woman stewed around and gave me annoyed looks for coming into the store and not calling ahead. When I tried to pay with a bank-issued check, I had to wait around for nearly 20 minutes before they told me that they have never seen a bank-issued check and sent me on my way.\n\nThe entire time I was there, it felt like they thought I just stole a bunch of money and were treating me like a crook. I am definitely not going back to complete the transaction. If I'm going to be buying an expensive piece of machinery, I really expect the service to at least be a little more enthusiastic.\n\nLike Nick T. said, I guess it's a good place if you wanna grab a used bike or know exactly what you want. If you're looking to broker a new bike, go to a bigger shop with salesmen that actually sound like they're living beings."
0,"I am kind to all service workers! always! This place has the worst service I have ever seen. I do not expect four star treatment from fast food but this place is ridiculous. You better check your bag because they are going to forget something. Yesterday my husband went to get a quickie family fish dinner. He was told that no sorry we are out of hushpuppies and Pepsi. Okay thats fine but what can we have to replace the hushpuppies? He was told to go down the street there is a store. This is inside, not the drive thru. It seems that this is a common experience at this restaurant. I already sparingly frequent fast food establishments but this will definitely be the last attempt. And yes I have contacted the corp. I dont want anything from them though, they can keep it."
0,"I developed my 120 film here the other day, and they charged me an extra 4 dollars a roll for no reason.  On the website they say $8 but they charged me $12.  The owner is very pretentious and rude.  When I told him that it says 8 dollars online he didn't care at all.  When I dropped my film off the high school kid didn't even tell me the price because \""it is too much for me to calculate\""  Also, the photo equipment, darkroom equipment and film are way over priced.  I am never going back to this place.  I strongly urge everyone to never enter or deal with Bernie's Photo.  Rather, use the websites of companies like B&H, Adorama, or Calumet.  The have MUCH better customer service and better prices.  Very disappointed that this is the only photo store in the city."
0,"Went in to buy a cold shoe adapter in a pinch on my way to a shoot. He charged me $20 for the same exact item that sells for $6.29 at B&H. I bought it without thinking, as I was stressing on the way to a gig, but was furious when I thought about it in the car.\nUnfortunately, this is the only game in town. Makes me glad I live in New York City. You would think a store in a dying industry would thrive to provide better customer service, pretty much the only reason why I would go to a small store rather than a big one. They don't even offer that."
0,"Just stopped in to see about selling my Canon Rebel T3 to buy a 60D (that they don't have in stock because it's \""old\""). I was offered $50 for my T3, that is currently being sold online for over $300. I asked why such a low price and was told that since it was an older model it wasn't worth as much. Needless to say, I walked out with my T3. Sucks that this is the ONLY camera shop in Pittsburgh."
0,"Despite living in PIttsburgh for most of my life, I've somehow managed to never eat at Max's Allegheny Tavern until recently.  \n\nMy initial impression of the restaurant was positive - the place had an old neighborhood feel to it, a small crowd was drinking at the end of the antique hardwood bar, and the German murals on the walls made me crave an icy-cold German lager with a stout head of foam.  I thought about how well German potato salad would taste with that beer.  So I grabbed a seat at the bar and eagerly awaited the first taste of my beer.\n\nAnd I waited...and waited...and waited some more - for over 15 minutes before someone came around to take the order.  Actually that isn't quite accurate.  Two employees came around - one to the end of the bar, and one behind the bar directly opposite me.  Both of them stared at me.  Neither one greeted me or asked me what I would have like to order.  I stared back, incredulously, and even made a \""what's going on here\"" palms-extended-upward-shoulder-shrug gesture.  Neither one took the hint.\n\nFinally a third employee came around the bar and took my order.  Great, I thought to myself, finally that beer.  She served the beer in a Mason jar.  WTF?!?  Who serves imported German lager at a German restaurant in a freaking Mason jar?  Max's does.  The beer was devoid of its head, likely the result of a bad beer pour and/or a less than perfectly clean glass (an endemic problem with Pittsburgh restaurants, in my observation).  I was sad.  I quaffed my beer quickly in an attempt to salve my irritation and opened the menu.\n\nMy first impression of the menu can be summed as follows: \""Uh-oh\"".  The menu is huge with a number of \""slow-food\"" stews and braises.  The restaurant is more than half-empty.  How can a restaurant prepare such a large number of menu items, including more than a few labor-intensive dishes, freshly every day and still stay in business when the place isn't even half-full?  Answer: They can't.  The food isn't fresh.\n\nI ordered the Wiener Schnitzel.  I love properly prepared Wiener Schnitzel.  Made with fresh butterflied veal breast, slightly pounded and seasoned, well-coated in fresh bread crumbs, and pan-fried in clarified butter until golden brown on the outside and juicy on the inside, Wiener Schnitzel is the ultimate comfort food.  \n\nSadly, Max's Wiener Schnitzel had nothing to do with properly prepared Schnitzel.  The veal was super-thin, had a texture that strongly suggested it had been mechanically processed, and tasted as if it was pre-breaded and frozen.  It wasn't pan fried either.  The breaded, frozen, puck was simply dropped into a fryolater - where the breading puffed out and fell off of the meat in places (which doesn't happen when the cutlet is resting against the cooking surface under its own weight as when the dish is properly pan-fried).  The edges of the sad Schnitzel had curled up and it looked a horrible mess on the plate.  Curly Schnitzel?!?  My stomach dropped.\n\nMy sides, German potato salad and braised red cabbage, were equally awful.  The German potato salad had an unnatural glossy sheen - the kind that typically comes from bottled sauces that contain high fructose corn syrup.  The \""bacon\"" in the dressing was nothing more than tiny flecks of some sort of processed, possibly faux, \""meat\"".  The potatoes were suspiciously uniform in thickness and roundness - exactly the homogeneity that is found in pre-peeled, pre-sliced, vacuum-sealed processed potatoes.  It was a gluey, sickly sweet, mess.  I didn't have more than a bite or two.  The braised red cabbage didn't taste fresh - it tasted like it had been sitting in a steam table for a day or two and my order was its last chance to be eaten.  \n\nMax's Allegheny Tavern bills itself on their web site as, \""The Best in German Fare.  The Best in Service\"".\n\nThat's total bullshit.  It's awful - both for service and fare.\n\nIf you want good, authentic, German fare (in which the Schnitzel is properly pan-fried to order and delicious), join the Teutonia Mannerchor down the street.  \n\nI'll never return."

0,"My husband and I have been to this restaurant many times over the past 20 years and went for sandwiches tonight. Sorry to say it was the worst food we have ever eaten at this place. Reuben sandwich was greasy and had little meat. Sweet potato fries were not edible. We ate at a table at the bar and told Andy our bartender but got zero satisfaction. Since we've had such a bad experience and no effort by the restaurant to remedy a BAD MEAL, be warned!"
0,"I really wanted to like this place. Great reviews and a renovated priory--what a great idea! The pictures on the website are beautiful.\n\nWe found a grumpy old man at the front desk, and he could not have been less interested in our arrival. It felt like we were disturbing him to ask for our room key. But the fun started when we returned later in the evening. We found the rollaway we had requested (and paid for) not present, and I went back down to the old gentleman. He stared at me and then went back to pecking at his computer. I waited. Suddenly he looked up at me and started yelling, something to the effect that there wasn't anything that he could do, and that he would see if someone could do something but probably not. He also angrily admitted that the reservation did show the rollaway.\n\nI slunk away with my guest who had by now come down, too, embarrassed and insulted. It shouldn't be this way. If this is personalized service, I'd rather stay at a motel.\n\nEven without grumpy old man, there's nothing special about this place. The rooms were ok, but the bathrooms tiny (I guess they should be called showerrooms). Everything else was sub-par. The dining room breakfast was served in was tacky and the coffee awful. We did not dare try the free wine. The hotel is in a bad neighborhood.\n\nFor the money, find a special at the William Penn on the Omni Hotels website. If you want a boutique hotel, try the Inn on the Mexican War Streets--a beautiful building with friendly owners just across from the National Aviary and that beautiful park. The Priory does not feel boutique and is not worth the hassle.\n\nPriory, get grumpy old man out of a customer-facing role."
0,"We stayed here and was initially disappointed-- being new to town, our first impression was that Pittsburgh was a very very bad town full of homeless and degenerates (the area, I find out later, is one of the worst spots in the city!).  The hotel is located across the street from a housing authority building.  Projects?  UGH.  Great.  \n\nThen we were put into a \""historical\"" room that was similar to that of a rundown cheap apartment-- old shower stall, moldy threadbare carpeting, lumpy squeaky bed.  \n\nI find out an hour later (after freaking out about the lo-end aspect of this room) that they have new rooms that were just recently renovated.  I asked to see the room, and then ultimately change to that room-- for a fee, of course.  About 50% more expensive.  But I pay more because NO WAY would I be able to exist in this old \""historical\"" creepy room.  \n\nFinally, a regular room-- the \""renovated\"" room was similar to that of an acceptable hotel room.  Why even keep this historical, old, dingy, dirty room?  Do they figure unsuspecting people who don't know any better will just accept it b/c they have no other choice?? \n\nI slept well in the \""new\"" renovated room, and would have been freaked out all night in the old room. What a difference. Actually, the bed and linens were very, very comfortable.  The bathroom was nice and clean.  The room was what I expected a hotel room to be... not high end four seasons, but not cheap and nasty either. \n\nThe hotel obviously had availabilities of the new, renovated rooms, so why put us in an old, unrenovated, ugly old apartment looking room? If they believed in upgrading, then they would have at least gotten repeat business!! For those who are going to book here, pay more for the new rooms, or go somewhere else.  The option of staying in the old room should not be an option at all.  \n\nI don't think I will ever go back here if I ever go back to Pittsburgh.  I will stay at a chain hotel-- marriot or whatever.  What is money except a means to be comfortable and live?  I will spend more next time.\n\nBreakfast was \""eh\"".  It was free-- small stations of some fruit, cheese, small pastries, cereal, yougurt and two hot items:  sausage + bacon.  OJ, Cranberry, Milk and Coffee also available.  Honestly, I felt like I was in college, and watching my pennies (poor), staying here..."
0,"Was at a beautiful wedding.  Staff was terrible, unpleasant, and the two slobs at the front desk need to be in the back with their people skills.  Nice hotel but make sure you take some warm bodies with you because the \""people\"" at the priory are cold, miserable and just plain miserable. I get better guest service at Holiday Inn"
0,"We decided to have a little staycation at the Priory earlier this month.  My husband made the reservation with a special they were having for a dinner date night.  With the special, they give you a few Pittsburgh restaurants to choose from and you get a $50 voucher to that restaurant.  When my husband called the Priory, they said they would make the reservations and call us back on the time.  We never got a call about the reservation time which was annoying.  But the main issue was we checked in, talked to the girl at the front desk about having the shuttle take us to this reservation at Meat and Potatoes, and she set us up with the shuttle.  We go in the room, look around for the $50 voucher, and it's not in the room so we assumed (i know we should never assume) that it was taken care of with Meat and Potatoes when they  made our reservation.  We had a fabulous dinner at M&P, great food, great service, and the bill comes.  We asked the server about this Priory $50 voucher and he had never heard about it so the manager comes over and says they didn't give them anything but to have them call and ask for him and he'll work it out.  We called the Priory and told them this, the girl who answered gave us an attitude and said you should have asked for it.  Then refused to call M&P to talk to the manager.  She just said to pay the full bill and we can work it out when we get back to the hotel.  We gave the manager our phone and he was yelled at as well about this.  He took our word that the Priory would deliver it to him the next day and he deducted the $50 from our bill.  It was embarrassing and it wasn't the issue with the money, just the service with the priory.  This showed us two things: We won't be going back to the Priory due to the lack of service and lack of respect and we WILL be going back to M&P because their service was impeccable."
0,"I really don't know how this place got any good reviews. One big problem is that the place is dirty, the carpets, the lighting above the tables and the furniture. I have tried this place 5 times in the past 2 years and this is how it went. The 1st time I had a burger which tasted funny and I didn't finish it. I got food poisoning and was so sick. This I thought might have been a stomach flu so I did try this place again. The 2nd time I was with some friends from the neighborhood and 3/5 of us had the spaghetti and meatballs and we got food poisoning.Now I'm thinking that they have a hygiene problem with the ground meat. I was going to stay away from the place but a friend from Troy hill liked to stop there because it was close to her home. No problem,next time I got french fries with gravy. How could this be a problem?.When they got to the table they had put cold canned gravy on my fries.When I told the waitress about it she took it back to the kitchen and microwaved it till it was the heat of lava. Needless to say I refused to pay for them. The 4th time my friend dragged me there, I had a salad. I didn't get sick but it wasn't anything special with bagged salad mix and a couple of under ripe tomato pieces and cucumber. The last time I only got a slice of pie and this was good. I no longer have to go to Billy's, my dear friend has passed away and I refuse to go anywhere near the place. To the owner-Please sell the restaurant, you obviously don't care for the place or know how to handle food safely."
0,"How to put this gently?\n\nWhile I may go back to Pittsburgh some day, I will never return to the Carnegie Museum of Art. \n\nIt's not that I mind that its gallery seemed small compared to others I have viewed (sometimes small museums have some hidden treasures) or that one whole gallery was blown glass and I felt like I was at a bong shop on haight st. in sf. \n\nIt comes down to the fact that a docent, while trying to explain a painting with a watchtower in it, told the students it was a watchtower \""from Auschwitz, a place where they basically fried a lot of Jews\"".  Seriously? That's how she chose to describe concentration camps to a large class of what I could only guess were middle schoolers? It sounded like she described a bad breakfast joint...\""oh that place? they basically just fry eggs\"".\n\nOn top of all that, the description of the piece stated the watchtower was reminiscent of those that were spread throughout East and West Germany during Hitler's rule (i.e. not those in Auschwitz).\n\nIn sum, docents are a reflection of the institution in which they volunteer, and this one sucked. So, Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, if you're going to hire racist people to lead your tours, at least make sure they have their facts straight (or can read)."
0,"In response to the response I received from the Museum rep, I called and left a message and never received a reply as of yet, but you reponded on Yelp. This week is the 3rd week. your response stated that my refund was sent this week, if you are speaking about this current week, today is the 14th, monday and the week has just begun. If you are talking about last week, can you please tell me what day since leaving messages do not gain a response except to be contacted here on Yelp. Thank you."

0,"If I could give this restaurant a zero, I would. We were just asked by our waitress to leave because someone with a reservation was waiting for our table. My father and father-in-law were still finishing up their coffee and we had not yet finished our dessert! I've never been so humiliated. Do NOT go to this restaurant!\nTheir food was mediocre at best. If you want excellent Italian in a small intimate restaurant, go to Dish on the South Side. I will not be going back."
0,"The best thing about this place is Sam. The worst thing about this place is also Sam.\n\nWhat was great was that Sam made me feel at home and treated me like someone he had known for a long time. He took me to the back of his warehouse, gave me a free beer to drink, and engaged me in plenty of conversation. At one point, though, he said, \""You look oriental, but you also look American.\"" I'm pretty sure he wasn't meaning for it to be offensive, and I just discounted it as his being an old man who didn't know it was no longer politically correct to say things like that.\n\nThis is not why I recommend against Caruso's, however. The reason why I'll never go there again is because Sam knowingly sold me expired beer.\n\nI was on my way back from the North Side to the East End where I live and after seeing these good reviews, I decided to stop by. I wanted a case of Yuengling, but Sam said, \""Why don't you try this instead,\"" and popped open a fresh bottle of Castello, an Italian beer. He had me drink it, all the while espousing its comparative taste to Yuengling at a cheaper price point. It certainly tasted alright, and a case of it was a couple dollars less than what Yuengling was going for.\n\nSince the Castello tasted fine, I ended up buying a case of it on Sam's recommendation. A few days later when I opened the box and drank a couple of the beers, however, I noticed that they tasted funny. That's when I looked at the label and saw how each of the bottles had its \""sell by\"" date marked out in black Sharpie. You could see the numbers underneath the Sharpie, and the dates were for well over two years ago. So basically, Sam had convinced me to buy something he hadn't been able to sell, knowing that I lived in the East End and probably wasn't going to visit again anyway.\n\nStale beer aside, there's another big reason not to go to Caruso's: Their prices are steep--$24 for a case of Yuengling. While Sam might be a more charming character than the young folks at my neighborhood distributor Pistella's, at least I know that Pistella's has significantly lower prices and actually has enough customers and product turnover that they won't purposely sell me something that's not fresh."
0,"Awful.  I didn't know how bad it was until I went to a different GE and saw how good it could be.  The lines are long, the produce selection is minimal, and the store is overcrowded.\n\nThe last straw was yesterday when the cashier blew her nose, stuck kleenex up her nose, then put it back in her pocket and continued to scan groceries.  When I complained to the manager, they denied any of their employees were sick.\n\nI'm done shopping at this store."
0,"Scariest/shadiest grocery store experience in my life. Hubby and I pulled in only to see a few cars down, people selling who-knows-what out of their car trunk. Also this is the only Giant Eagle tht gives you a really hard time if you ever forget your advantage card and give your phone no instead (it works at the other ones just fine). Then we leave by waiting for a really dazed/swaying woman to finish wandering around back and forth in front of us, and pass by a drive-by fat cash exchange (drugs?) on our way out of the parking lot. We are definitely scared to return, and will never need grapes (or any other groceries) so desperately again."
0,"The store reeks of rotting fish, the security guards watch you like a hawk and the food selection is the worse I've seen in any Giant Eagle in the city.\n\nOne plus if you must shop here there are plenty of jitney drivers waiting for you to come out to offer you a ride.  That can be a big help if you are like me and don't have a car. \""Need a car\"" haha some things about living in the hood just never change. \n\nWith this being the closet G E to Downtown and PNC Park and Heinz field I would think they would renovate but it's been years and still no change."
0,"Awful.  Worst grocery store I've ever been to.  To make it worse, they are supposed to open at 7.  At 7:10, I was told they were \""still getting ready to open\"" and I should come back \""around 7:30\"""
0,The store has a weird rotting meat smell sometimes. The selection isn't amazing but there are a few interesting items here. As other people commented there are always people hanging around outside.... But they are friendly at least to me! One thing I like about the store is the proximity to my house. The biggest let down is the sky high prices that I think GE is notorious for... I miss Kroger
0,"Zero stars? Really terrible store. High prices, THE WORST PRODUCE EVER (And no, it isn't the lighting...) and rude employees. \nNever mind the people hanging out out front and in the parking lot, who cares. What I'm truly concerned about is the vast discrepancy between this store and very nearly all of the other Giant Eagle locations in the Pittsburgh area. One would assume that there would be some quality control within their chain of stores. Truly sad that the North Side has so few options at which to shop for reasonably priced, fresh food. \n\nAlso, enjoy getting followed around by the walleyed \""undercover\"" employee. Looks like Lurch from the Addams Family. Good riddance."
0,"So I got a call from Giant Eagle asking me to give my opinion of this store. My recommendation was to burn this place to the ground. Buckle up for crappy produce, rotten fish, old meat, and security guards that speck you be stealin! This is the Gh**to Eagle!"
0,The problem with this dry cleaner is poor counter service.  I have never been treated in such a poor manner - and the sad part is that this SERVICE provider doesn't care.  I recommend going elsewhere.  They are not worth my money.

0,"STAY AWAY...\nWe've been 3 times over the past few years, each time we say \""let's try it again\"" followed by \""wish we'd done something else\"".\n\nReminds me of the movie line \""Run away, run very far away\""\n\nLast nite after Steelers/Jets was last straw. I hope the owner or general manager reads this. And think the health department should too.\n\nService is mediocre and slow. consistently. Waitress was ok in attitude.\n\nAfter our soup starter (good french onion soup) we waited and waited and waited and waited for our mains. Noticing us staring at her, waitress stopped by, went into kitchen, came back and said we were next. my watch said 8:31. Then her manager came by and argued with me and said we were next, then at 8:52pm the horrible food finally arrived. That's 21 minutes to be next. In that time we watched 4 tables turn from being seated to drinks to mains to check down while we waited for our main. \n\nManager embarrassed himself. Said they were busy and working our food and he had checked and would come soon. I told him about the 4 tables turning and he said no they didn't. then I said I used to manage restaurants and know what customer service and ticket times are and he challenged me and said no I didn;t and I had no idea what I was talking about. What an idiot! First rule of restaurant business is the customer is always right.\n\nThen the food arrived. How hard is it to do chicken marsala with mushrooms, seriously? It was two soggy fried chicken tenders from the deep fryer (not pan sauteed) over a bowl of bowtie pasta with shrooms and a sauce. While the sauce did have some marsala in it, it was full of sour cream and tasted like stroganoff and a little funny. The Penne ala vodka was sauteed canned tomatoes and no flavor. We were so hungry we ate most and left.\n\n1 hour later I was sick on the side of the road from the dinner and still feel really rough this morning."
0,"My husband and I are Cubs fans and flew into Pittsburgh to see Friday and Saturday's Cubs-Pirates game this past weekend (7/7 & 8).  We got to PNC Park around 5 p.m. and since the gates weren't open we decided to sit and have some drinks before the game.  We stopped first at Atria's.  Although there was only one other table occupied outside, we were told if we weren't going to order food (just drink) we would have to give up our table if people, who were eating food needed it.  This was RIDICULOUS  to us so we left!  We were paying guests just like their other guests!!  Anyway we went a few businesses down and drank at Dominic's.  We went to Dominic's both nights and probably spent close to $100 AND did up getting FOOD.  Atria's better rethink how they treat guests...."
0,"Ugh, I hate this place.  People from work drag me here to lunch more often than I would like.  The food is overpriced.  The service is snotty and slow.  I can barely get free in under an hour-and-a-half.  The food is forgettable and the menu sparse.  They're terrible for pick-up too - even when you call way ahead, you're made to wait, and they're surly about taking care of you when you arrive for your food.  You can do better for lunch on the northshore pretty much anywhere.  Try SoHo or Finnegan's instead."

0,"ok, i don't want to judge all atria's by this one. in fact, i wouldn't even judge this atria's solely by this one experience. but let me tell you, i was highly disappointed.\ni will point out the good parts of the night first. we arrived to see a band play. the entertainment was great, didn't cost extra (although there was a $20 minimum per person), and i liked the set up in the room where they played. also, the soup i got (crab bisque) was delicious!\nok, now, for the rest of the experience. first of all, our service was AWFUL. i don't know our server's name, and i know some of the wait wasn't his fault, as there was a large party upstairs. but it took at least ten minutes to even order our drinks, another 15 before we even got them. ten more minutes before we could order our food, and after the meal, we must have waited at least 15 if not 20 minutes for our check before one of the members in our party finally had to go up to our waiter and complain. i saw him checking on other tables, and it didn't seem like he had many tables to keep him so busy. as a server, myself, i always give my servers the benefit of the doubt, but it really got to be too much. the one thing i will say for him though, was that he was very nice. but for how much we waited, we should have had something comped or at least got some sort of apology BEFORE we had to complain.\nthe rest of the food and drinks were okay. good, but not enough to make up for the service. i had the berry mojito to drink and the greek salad to eat.\ni'd try another atria's before i'd go back to this one. but now i'm weary of the restaurant all together."
0,I came here on the Fourth of July after getting off of work. My friend and I stopped for one drink before the fireworks. Let's just say I will never return. I stood there for a good 15 minutes with maybe 5 people tops at the bar. The bartenders never once acknowledged me yet they did manage to make eye contact. They then all walked out from behind the bar and went outside. It took another ten minutes until finally the manager came over and served me. I am a bartender and I am appalled to see such people being employed at what seems like a decent place. I am a phenomenal tipper being that I am in the industry and sadly I didn't leave a single dollar. Hopefully they can learn from their mistakes instead of probably losing more potential customers.  What a shame.
0,"After eating lunch several days a week at Atrias PNC Park restaurant for many years, I have finally decided that the price has just lost any relation to portions/quality and will not be dining there anytime in the near future.\n\nGradually, over the past year, the prices have continued to increase to the point of being dinner menu prices for lunch size meals.  Recently, the portion size has significantly diminished, to the point of being almost comical today.\n\nThe fish \""special\"" today was BBQ salmon with asparagus.  It consisted of about 3oz of salmon and four spears of asparagus.  It actually looked ridiculous on the plate.  The specials used to have 5-6 oz of fish, included a decent portion of vegetables, and rice, all for a dollar or two less.  While a bit more than I wanted to spend for lunch, at least the quality and size of portion made some sense.  Today, I spent $15 plus tax and tip and left feeling like I had eaten an appetizer and still hungry.\n\nThey have pushed it too far, I am no longer willing to waste my money at Atria's.  Too bad, we used to really enjoy lunch there."

0,"Ugh!  Another losing season.  WTF man, weren't we in first place at the All-Star Break?  What happened?  I wasn't expecting a World Series Champ or even a Pennant winner.  But was a winning season too much to ask for?  This marks the 20th anniversary since the Pirates' last winning season.  That's right folks--it's been since 1992.  Let's take a look at the world of 1992.\n\nBASEBALL:  The Pirates' roster that year included Stan Belinda, Doug Drabek, Zane Smith, Denny Neagle, Jay Bell, Orlando Merced, Andy Van Slyke, and of course Barry Bonds.  All have since retired.  The only new ballparks were New Comiskey Park (now U.S. Cellular Field) and Camden Yards.  No stadiums had corporate names.  The Arizona Diamondbacks, the Colorado Rockies, the Miami Marlins, and the Tampa Bay (Devil) Rays didn't exist.  The Washington Nationals were the Montreal Expos.  The Milwaukee Brewers were in the AL.  Both the NL and the AL only had two divisions each.  The minor league Washington Wild Things didn't exist either and nor did their league.  KBL was the big cable sports channel.\n\nTV:  \""Saturday NIght Live's\"" cast included Dana Carvey, Ellen Cleghorne, Chris Farley, Tim Meadows, Mike Myers, Kevin Nealon, Phil Hartman,  Chris Rock, Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, and David Spade.  \""Seinfeld\"" hadn't become a huge hit yet and no one knew Kramer's first name.  Monday nights on NBC included \""Murphy Brown\"", \""Evening Shade\"" and \"" Northern Exposure\"".\n\nMOVIES:  The top movies included \""Lethal Weapon 3\"", \""Basic Instinct\"", \""Hone Alone 2\"", \""The Bodyguard\"" and \""Aladdin\"".  When you wanted to watch movies at home, you had to rent them from the video store and you watched them on VHS tapes or laserdiscs.  \n\nMUSIC:  Bruce Springsteen released \""Lucky Town\"" and \""Human Touch\""  on the same day.  R.E.M. had \""Automatic for the People\"".  Gin Blossoms released their first album \""New Miserable Experience\"", which stayed on the charts for almost two years.  Bare Naked Ladies \""Gordon\"" featured the cult classic \""If I Had a Million Dollars.\""  You either listened to albums on cassette or CD and you bought them at record stores like National Record Mart.  Doug Hopkins (Gin Blossoms), Kurt Cobain (Nirvana), Shannon Hoon (Bline Melon) and Jerry Garcia (Grateful Dead) were all alive.\n\nTECHNOLOGY:  Few people had internet access.  You also used pay phones because you didn't have a cell phone.  You watched movies on a VCR.  You met up with your friends without texting them.  You ordered merchandise by \""sending in\"" or by calling an \""800\"" number.  You had to buy tickets by waiting in line.  \n\nAnd OJ Simpson was still a football hero.\n\nSo that's it, Pittsburgh Pirates.  I feel like telling you I'm done with you guys.  I'm no fair weather fan, but 20+ years of losing is enough."
0,"I was raised Catholic (but no longer practice), and have always been fascinated by relics and the stories of saints--so I was really looking forward to our tour of St Anthony's. BEWARE: I can't speak for their other guides, but the gentleman (a lay person, not a priest) who \""led\"" ours was far more interested in haranguing the crowd on the nature of TRUE believers, the infallibility of the Catholic faith, and whether we'd all found our \""charisms\"" - the gifts we needed to be using if we were going to be saints, too--than showing us any relics.

0,"So, this is what happened.\n\nI went their complaining about a possible over heating and requesting a change of oil. This was my first visit there. They topped off my coolant for free and changed my oil. I had a check engine light on for which I knew the code and was holding off on repairing it. \n\nThey charged me $20 for reading the check engine light code and turning it off. I didn't want that. I pointed this out on the bill and he said that, its fine, I can just pay for the oil change (~$42). He asked me if I had $42 cash on me. If I did, I could have paid and left a happy customer. But I didn't, so I gave him my card and he went in the back and swiped it for the full price ($42 + $20 + tax). When I was signing the transaction receipt, I told him that he swiped for the full price. This apparently pissed him off a lot, he very rudely handed $20 from his pocket and asked me to \""Get out of there\"" - and walked out. I tried to talk to him and explain my reason of asking - it not being the matter of $20 but of the principle that he said he wasn't going to charge me for what I didn't want. But he wouldn't listen, was very rude and said \""You're Done\"" and \""Get out\"" more times. I left. \n\nI ain't going back where they treat customers like that."
0,"Ordered a lg pizza for pick up, 30-40 min wait. Went to pick up my pizza and I arrived to have no pizza at all. They told a driver must have taken by accident. The skinny, is it took an hour for a new pizza, and they offered me nothing"
0,"Terrible. I lived about 2 blocks away - and with no other options - I still can't bring myself to order from here. Ordered twice in the last 90 days and both times it was terrible. Ended up waiting over an hour each time. First time I got home to find a totally different order; the send time waited over 1.5 hrs for a pizza. Both were crappy, at best. Staff was really rude both times."
0,"This place has THE WORST customer relations I've experienced in Pittsburgh since I moved here two months ago. My boyfriend was about to order a gyro, I was waiting for him at the table outside near the street with a drink and hotdog I had gotten elsewhere, there was absolutely no one else in their establishment. The person behind the counter then told my boyfriend that I was not welcome to sit at their outdoor seating area with him while he enjoyed his gyro. He canceled his order and we sat at the friendly place next door. Not only did Knossos lose my boyfriend's business that day, but they also lost both of us as future customers. What a petty and pathetic place."

0,"I bought a latte.....no wait! Actually, I bought coffee and espresso and two lattes and something to munch on (not all for me I had a friend with me). When I ordered the 2nd latte I sat down and realized I didn't have any foam so went back to the counter to ask for some and and she wanted to charge me!? Really!? Maybe it sound petty to you but I like my lattes fixed a certain way and foam is the best part! It's all about customer service and considering I had just spent over $25.00 a little foam wasn't much to ask. Good coffee. Bad customer service."
0,"This was my second visit and alas, my last. \n\nOur first visit was at lunch and it was just OK. We weren't blown away nor were we impressed. But I will always opt to support a local Mom & Pop shop if all things are equal. This last visit was the pits.\n\nIt was 5:30pm on a Saturday night. We were one of two tables. This is usually an indication of something fishy (excuse the pun.) Appetizer was edamame. It was overcooked and left uneaten. I am not the adventurous sushi order-er; I had California rolls and spicy tuna. The tuna rolls were mostly spicy sauce then fish, very mayonnaise-y and unsatisfying. As for my CA rolls, the avocado was all brown! Not just the parts on the top (because I checked!) all the way through. When I brought it to the staff's attention her response was \""Oh, yea. Avocado is like banana. They get brown very easily and we cut that yesterday.\"" WHAT?!? They did bring me another batch (that was part brown, part green) but it was too late. This was my first sushi restaurant EVER that we left half the rolls on the plate uneaten. Since we were all still hungry, my daughter picked up the table tent listing all the desserts. Yuck! Filthy. Not wiped down in a long while or perhaps ever. When I set it back is when I noticed the wall also needed a good wipe down. Needless to say, we skipped dessert. \n\nOur first visit deserved a 2.5 but this visit was a 1."
0,Pool hall and pretty crappy bar. Not much else to write home about. Was not a fan and won't be back here.
0,I've given this place enough 2nd chances and have had my last meal at this DIVE.\nFood is mediocre at best and you can't get any service because the \nwait staff is always outside having a cigarette. Very unappetizing to watch\nthem and the cook smoking then come back inside and NOT WASH THEIR\nHANDS. DISGUSTING !!!!!!!!!!!!!
0,"Read my first review... loved this place... Today I stopped in to look around,my niece was with me and I remembered that they had help wanted postings somewhere.. she inquired and the teenage girl behind the counter was SO rude, full on glaring and rolling of the eyes! NO JOKE. I wish that the manager had been in but hopefully she keeps track and knows what her counter staff is like when she is gone! I will go to party Cake shop from here on...There are too many great places to put up with attitude!"
0,"Pastries are nice but I bought a cake for my sisters bridal shower and they PUT THE WORDING ON THE CAKE INCORRECTLY! it was a Saturday and \""could not call a baker in to fix it so they could refund me the cake and just take this one, go somewhere else to buy a new cake, or try to fix the writing ourselves and just remove the word that was INCORRECT.\"" I spent hours on the phone with the manager and she was not very helpful or empathetic to the situation.  \n\nI then went to go pick up another cake for my sister for her husbands birthday and THE CAKE TOPPLED OVER IN THE BOX IN THEIR OWN FRIDGE!  I asked the lady if this happens often and she goes nope your just \""special\"".  Being really rude about it.  They patched the cake up and THEN showed me the cake and THERE WAS A WOODEN STAKE IN THE CAKE to \""keep it together\"".  I then said that there is a hole in the cake now and the counter lady said, \""Just smooth the hole over with your finger a little bit.\"" \n\n\nThe counter girls are always rude.  I honestly think they don't like me because they are nice to everyone else but myself. But if I would suggest I would NOT go here."
0,"We were having a Gender Naming Party for our first baby and we were excited to share this moment with friends and family. When we went to pick up our cake we were extremely disappointed in the way the staff handled our order. The mother to be on picking up the cake found out the gender of the baby! Without her husband! This was supposed to be a surprise at the party but it was on the receipt. How terrible! They knew when we placed the order that this was supposed to be a secret. When confronted with their error they were dismissive, condescending, and there was no effort to compensate her for her pain in finding out the gender at the bakery. We have done wedding cakes here, and many special events over the years. Never again!! Potomac Bakery you should be ashamed."
0,This was the worst hotel that I ever stayed in. my hubby and I  took the smoking room and it stunk sooo bad that I wanted to throw up. I was afraid to sleep in that nasty bed. in the morning at 5am I wanted to leave the room cuz smell was sooo gross that woke me up! I felt so dirty that I took two showers AT Other HOTEL. I never thought that I will have nightmares bcz of bad and stinky hotel.
0,"I've never been to Pittsburgh before and I planned on doing some heavy partying and needed a place to crash that was not on the floor so I booked this hotel the day before I drove up. I saw the reviews & ignored them because I figured I'd be drunk and happy enough to dive into a bed.\n\nI checked in around 2am, the girl who checked me in barely said anything to me besides \""initial here and sign here and your room is over there\"". The room smelt like hot dogs, the AC wasn't working at all so I was dripping in sweat all night, none of the lamps worked at all, there were holes in the pillow cases and bedding, there was a tiny blood stain on the sheet, I went down for the continental breakfast at 9:30am (it ends at 10am) and they already stopped serving, the shower was ice cold. I then checked for bed bugs after realizing the shithole I spent the night in last night (coast is clear). I checked out and went back to Baltimore, which seems like heaven on earth compared to Shittsburgh."
0,"BED BUGS!!! Horrible place! DO NOT STAY HERE!! Stayed here for a wedding we attended. Woke up in the middle of the night with bites all over my legs, arms, and back. We flip a pillow over and there it was. BED BUGS. We had to cut our trip short. The man at the front desk apologized and gave us the managers name and number and told us to call back later that morning. We have been calling since 8/10 and have yet to receive a call back. Such disrespect. We risk bringing back bed bugs and spending hundreds on extermination fees and no has the decency to call back."
0,"From reading other reviews and dining guides, it looks like this is very much a hit or miss place. Either you love pizza with toppings thrown on after cooking, or you don't. I fall into the later category: I didn't like it at all.\n\nI ordered a slice of cheese pizza and a grilled chicken salad. For the pizza, the crust was salvageable after I pushed aside a good quantity of cheese (most of it). The salad was...nothing short of horrific. Overloaded with fries and (big surprise) more cheese, getting to the lettuce and other toppings took some digging. Eventually, I found bland tomatoes and shredded iceberg lettuce hidden far below.\n\nI don't get this place."
0,"This \""pizza\"" was the worst food I have ever eaten."
0,Worse than store freezer pizza. What with the cold cheese on top of hot pizza? Terrible. If you want quality; Fiori's is a few miles away.
0,"My husband and I had this pizza for the first time last night.  He suggested it after hearing recommendations from friends.  This was the most disgusting excuse for a pizza I've ever had! We ordered pizza for pick up.  The girl told my husband 20 minutes and he picked our pizza up in a timely fashion.  The best thing about this pizza was the crust.  That was it! It was cold! It was not even warm like it had been warmed up before my husband picked up our order.  We got two extra toppings, which were just heaped in a pile on the middle of our slices.  These were cold too. And mushrooms from a can!!! Why am I paying extra for disgusting canned vegetables.  The sauce had absolutely no flavor and was completely cold. I would never go to this place ever again.  It was a lazy excuse for a pizza.  Who gives someone a COLD pizza for pick up?!?!?"
0,"I've never, EVER experienced such poor customer service before at any beer distributor.  Yes, I called them and asked for a price on ordering a case of import beer.  When they called me back with the price, I decilned purchase.  I was talking at the same time to another distributor who was doing a lot more leg work for me tracking down the supply chain.  When he informed me he could have a case shipped to wherever I bought my beer, I gave him Banksville Beer's name thinking I was giving them some extra business.  I don't normally get my beer from there.  When I stopped into Banksville to pick it up, a person who I assume was the owner got immediately defensive with me, raised his voice saying \""You told me you didn't want it.\""  I tried to explain what had happened, but he continuously interupted me with a constantly rising voice level barely allowing me to get a word in.  He claimed he did not speak to the guy I had spoken to, which was obviously a lie since he referred specifically to \""that person you (meaning me) talked to.\""  I finally had to cut him off and say, \""Listen, do you have the case here or not?\""  He said they did not, so I left.\n\nI can understand his frustration if what I did caused him any loss or inconveneince, but he did not need to take the majorly unprofessional approach that he did.  I honestly had no idea that I did anything wrong, and on the contrary thought I had actually done them a favor.  Had he explained the circumstance, it would have been no harm, no foul and lesson learned.  And I just would have asked them to order me a case straight out and would have returned for more cases to be orderd in the future.  But because of that reaction, I will NEVER step foot in there again under any circumstance.  No beer is worth dealing with a world class A-hole like that."

The waitress tried to make us feel welcome so we thank her for that but the feeling was uneasy and on top of all that, the food wasn't good it lacked lots of flavor \nI wouldn't recommend this spot to anyone keep driving"
0,"This store will not let you photograph their lighting fixtures. We browsed for a while and found a chandelier we liked, and my husband took a picture of it on his cell phone. The salesclerk told us that was not allowed. We were dumbfounded. We are renovating a house and need a number of light fixtures, plumbing fixtures, etc.-- the only way we can keep track of them all (and check if they actually might look good together) is to photograph everything we're seriously considering. We tried to explain this and the clerk said nope, not allowed. We asked why. She said, \""I don't know-- they just don't allow it.\"" Well I bet I know-- they don't want you going online in search of better pricing. But hey, NEWSFLASH-- that's how things work in 2012. I'm not going to drop $1,200 on a chandelier without looking it up online. (For the record, I understand that local businesses aren't usually going to have the lowest price available. I don't mind paying a bit of a premium to support a small business in Pittsburgh that gave me great in-person service. But like hell am I going to spend that kind of money without making sure I'm not getting completely ripped off.)\n\nWe tried to press further, though-- what about matching finishes or colors to other fixtures? The salesclerk said, \""Oh, people just tell us what colors they have in their room and how big the room is and we tell them what works.\"" I'm sorry, but unless you're omniscient, this is not acceptable. \n\nThe most insulting thing, though, is the clerk telling us \""I don't know\"" about a policy that's so clearly the exception to the local norm. If you're going to have a ridiculous, anachronistic rule, at least have the guts to explain why to customers when they ask."
0,"This place is another that is undeserving of your hard earned money!! The following is an email that I sent to the owner, it will shed a little light as to why I feel this way...I will also share his response, and what ultimately became of the situation. I know this one is long winded, but you should be forewarned about giving them your money!\n\nI have been to your bar many times, and I have had both good and less than average experiences, but this past Saturday was terrible! My girlfriend and I came to have some dinner around 9 pm. We knew it would be crowded due to the Penguin game, and that wasn't a problem. When we arrived, there were no seats at the bar or tables available anywhere. We decided to have a beer and wait. After the game was over, some tables opened up so we sat in an empty booth in the back and waited. After about 5 minutes, a waitress came over, cleaned our table, and made notice of the fact that we still had drinks. Sadly, this was the last time that she ever came to our table. We placed our closed menus at the end of the table...nothing, we put our empty glasses at the end of the table with the menus...nothing. We sat and waited for more than 15 minutes. All the while we were waiting, another group of four sat the table next to us, they were never given any attention. They got up and left after being completely ignored. I understand that the restaurant was busy, and that service and wait times may be impacted, but the way we were treated (or lack of being treated) was appalling. It was especially annoying to watch the server that initially cleaned our table giggling and carrying on with two other booths that appeared to be friends with her on the other side of the dining room and then when she was done she just casually walked over to another empty table picked up something off of it and went into the kitchen without even taking a look around the dining room. At this point we were disgusted and got up and left, I was annoyed and made mention of how awful the service in the back was to the doorman. The waitresses in the back were terrible and seemed to have no sense of urgency or seem to care about most of the customers, with the exception of the few tables that they were more interested in socializing with. This seems to be a problem, because on some of my past less than stellar experiences, the disappointment was again with the service from the back servers. On those occasions it was the same thing, they seemed to be more interested in being social butterflies than providing any sort of service. You don't need to improve your wait staff, you need to replace some of them, at least the people working the back dining room on this past Saturday, they were completely useless! Will I come back to your restaurant, I'm not sure. The food is good, but I work hard for my money, and I expect to receive more than good food in exchange for it. \n\nSincerely,\n Matt K.\n\nHere is the response that I got\n\nPlease give me a call (412)555-1212 to discuss the matter. I'm sorry & will make every attempt to make sure this doesn't happen again.\nThank you for making me aware of the situation.\nJoey DeMarco \n\nI promptly called him as soon as I got this email. It went to voice mail , so I left a message. That was it, the guy didn't even have the decency to return my phone call. It is amazing that this is how business owners expect to keep people coming through their doors and handing over their hard earned money. Support local businesses, but make sure they are deserving of your money!"
0,"Guy's Jumbot Plate O'Crap - Made a special trip in with my son this morning to enjoy the food at the Dor-Stop.We both made the same order Guy's Jumbot. When the order arrived mine was over cooked , the egg portion resembled the dry pressed paper used in the egg carton. My serving was served without cheese. My son's was fine. When I went to pay and said something I got a vacant stare and I am so sorry. I ended up with a take out for my dog to eat. teh toast was perfect though. I started makeing this hour long trek with family members about a year ago. We would come out about every 4-6 weeks. The last two trips the quality has started to slip a little...but never to this extent that it really mattered.Save yourself the effort ....This is not a Diner, this is not a drive-in...this does not even rank high enough to be a Dive. Denny's would be a better choice."
0,"For what it's worth, dor-stop isn't good as people say it was. People are fanatical about this place and its food. Is their food really tasty or they're popular because the network show? From my perspective, I detest their service, the service is notoriously horrible and unacceptable. Also the food was unpalatable. I order pumpkin flavor pancakes and side order scramble eggs. I was too full and their portion is huge so I left two pieces of pancakes. The waitress don't even bother to ask me if I need a box to take it home or if everything is good. Although she did refilled my coffee once, I barely see her stop by and there wasn't too many people in the diner is isn't likely she is occupied by that amount of customers.I think the waitress was rude because she never say thank you during the entire breakfast even when I tipped her. I should have known, I just feel like they treated me differently that's all. This review is based on my dinning experience and the service. Seriously if they mean business they should improve. Especially waitress was lack of enthusiasm. Do I want to come back? Never ever."
0,"I really, really wanted to try Dor - Stop, but it wasn't open when I went! My wife and I woke up early just to go there, and the diner was closed for the next few days, EVEN THOUGH IT DIDNT SAY THAT ON THE WEBSITE! Such a waste of time. If you're going to go, make sure you call ahead, just so you don't get screwed over like we did."

0,Compared to the original Don Campiti Pizza of the 60's and 70's this is not even close. The legacy of a superior pizza in Dormont has lost it. No longer up there with Beto's and area best. Sad to say this pizza was so bad. I have been a diehard customer of the 60's and 70's. Crust was like cardboard. Toppings were worse. What happened to the legacy Don Campitis Pizza ?
0,"When my car died, I originally had it towed to Ruffing because it was close to where my car broke down.  After I saw the good reviews, I figured it'd be worth a shot, and was surprised at how awful the people were.\n\nRuffing originally suggested I take my car to a dealer, since it's an uncommon model and they didn't know what the problem was.  I asked if I could just pay for a vehicle diagnostic, since they're more likely to be honest than a dealership. They said it would take around a day-and-a-half to get to it.\n\nAlmost three days later, I hadn't heard back from them.  Since I need my car on a daily basis, it was frustrating that they were well past their quoted time with no updates as to what was going on.  The repairs are what should take time - not a diagnostic.\n\nMy biggest issue was the attitude I received when I called.  When I called to see why there was a delay, the mechanic became agitated.  His tone became condescending when he told me it's my fault for leaving the car with him -- that I just HAD to have him look at it and I was SO against going elsewhere.  He said he had cars sitting there for weeks that he hasn't even touched yet (?) so he can't bother with mine. Ultimately I had to get my car towed to a dealership anyway, since I couldn't afford to have my car sit at their shop for \""weeks\"".\n\nI wished they were more up front with how back logged they were, rather than trying to give me a schedule they couldn't abide by, and then take their stress out on me when I followed up with them.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this mechanic to anyone.  You're better off going somewhere that has realistic wait-times and up front communication.  And you definitely don't want to deal with a mechanic who is going to lose his cool with you at the drop of a hat."
0,"You know it's bad when you get in your car practically in tears because of how bad the haircut is. Having curly hair, I've had my fair share of terrible haircuts. The one I had at this salon was among the worst. I explained to the owner of the salon how I wanted my layering, but apparently because I didn't tell him exactly how to cut my hair - since after all, I figured he's the one who should know how to cut hair, including curly hair - it's my fault that I received such a terrible haircut. Sorry, I guess I was too busy watching in horror as he blunt cut horizontal layers into my hair (exactly the opposite of what you're supposed to do with curly hair). The owner clearly has no idea how to cut curly hair. And he's overpriced to boot. The other stylists may give better cuts, but the owner's attitude (\""It's not my fault\"") suggests this salon deserves no one's business."
0,"Short of getting on my hands and knees and begging the stylist to cut ONE HALF of an INCH, I don't know what else I could have done.. \n\nBefore every haircut I explain that I am very particular about the length of my hair -- I want to keep it long, it grows very slowly, that it is IMPERATIVE to only cut a TINY AMOUNT off, etc, etc. I made this extremely clear to the stylist. She promised that she \""wouldn't do anything crazy..\""\n\nLet's just say I am using this as a cathartic outlet for my experience because I went in for a trim but left with FOUR INCHES missing from my hair. I'm still recovering aesthetically and emotionally from this trauma! It just doesn't make sense to me why a stylist would do exactly the opposite of what was requested. I think maybe she is used to cutting children's hair and not listening to them. But either way, what should have been a really quick/easy trim, turned into one of the most extreme haircuts of my life. It all could have been so easily avoided. It doesn't feel fair. \n\nProceed with caution.."

0,"I have dined at Namaste for the final time.  I am tired of being served by an individual that does not speak: who treats the customer with disdain and indifference.  The words \""thank you\"" and \""how are you\"" are not part of the lexicon here.  The buffet items reflect economizing.  Virtually no cauliflower is used, thus my favorite dish, aloo gobi, is never offered..  There sometimes is no rice pudding, and in place of the India staple buffet item, chicken tandoori, the cheaper and less appealing chicken wings are offered.  It is s shame that such a beautiufl, comfortable restaurant space is being wasted.  For a mere $1.01 more, I can receive a spectacular and delicious array of the finest Indian food in the lovely atmosphere of All India, North Craig Street, Oakland, where I receive gracious, personal attention from the owners."
0,"Here is our experience on my friend's daughter's birthday party:-\n\nI and my wife attended my friend's daughter's birthday party here recently. My friend mentioned that they finalized the menu for the lunch buffet a week in advance. The restaurant chef at the last moment on the day of party, just one hour before lunch, told that they did not get the \""PANEER/cheese\"". They can substitute it for \""MALAI KOFTA\"". It was unbelievable that they changed the dish at the last moment requested by my friends as 50% guests were vegetarian and hence need a cheese / \""PANEER\"" entree. On the other hand the \""MALAI KOFTA\"" was just \""POTATO\"" in the gravy. The quality of food in this party was awfully bad. \n\nThis is a humble request to all INDIAN Americans and all NON-INDIAN Americans that please don't throw your money by going to this restaurant. We are not here to misguide you or someone from a competitor restaurant. You can confirm these details with me anytime, I am engineer by profession. I was thinking to host my son's birthday party over here next month but I am lucky to get an experience before hand. I will NEVER NEVER recommend this place EVER."
0,"Shockingly bad.  I know it's Pittsburg so my expectations were low, but there is no call for rudeness.  The old lady should retire.  The young waiter was ok but clearly  scared of the woman.   I went to the dinner buffet at 530 pm, the food was obviously left over from lunch, the rice was so old it was crunchy, all other food was very low quality and mostly cold. I always like to say something nice so the sweet carrot dish was not horrible.  My search for quality Indian food in the 'burgh continues."
0,"I cannot believe how anyone can like this place. May be the service was bad the day I went. I walked in .... then found that the place had a smell that was not pleasant. But, I got adjusted to that in a few moments. I found only 4 or 5 items in the buffet. None of them looked fresh. I tried this place only because of the other yelp reviews. I would never go there again."
0,"Maharaja is located in the Days Inn on Banksville Rd, and we tried it one day for lunch. Not really understanding the positive reviews here, but to each his/her own. I found the food watery, overcooked (even by Indian food standards) and tasteless. There seemed to be no care in preparation of the dishes, so that the vegetables weren't cut into the same sizes, each dish tasted much like the other, and the food didn't even look attractive. I don't mind divey surroundings, but I abhor a smelly old carpet, and they have wall to wall carpeting that was around before most of us were. They offer mango lassi which they keep in the original gallon plastic jug that they bought it in...at least pretend that you made it. There are 2 better Indian restaurants a stones throw from this place...Namaste and Mintt, both across the street."
0,"I actually don't mind the Arby's chain; I certainly don't go to one on a regular basis, but when I do I usually enjoy the treat that is a nice giant sandwich and a side of curly fries. Usually what I get from an Arby's is an a-ok fast food variety sandwich that, while greasy, is still very tasty and doesn't leave me feeling sick to my stomach.\n\nThat said, I never enjoy the food I pick up from this particular Arby's. Firstly, often when I've placed an order in their drive-thru I've found that I've had to sit and wait for my \""fast food\"" for 10 to 15 minutes. After waiting for my food - on the days that I didn't leave the line in frustration before placing an order at all because I couldn't even do so in a reasonable amount of time - I've found that what I've gotten has been mediocre compared to what I've experienced at other Arby's. Common issues I've come across include the lack of sauces when I've asked for them, overcooked food, and so much grease that the sandwich begins coming apart AND after eating I begin to feel sick to my stomach.\n \nSorry, guys. I may not expect a lot from a fast food joint, but this Arby's just doesn't impress me."
0,"Hostess was very awkward when seating us. Sat us in the corner in a small booth with a broken seat right up against another large party. The place was by no means busy. We sat and waited for someone to acknowledge us. We watched 4 members of the wait staff each attend to the 4 other tables and not one of them ever acknowledged us or came over. After 15 minutes of being ignored by staff, we got up and walked out. It's a shame too... we liked the looks of the menu and the bar list and specials. Don't think we'd ever come back after that. There are plenty of other places."

0,one of the worst steak sandwiches i've ever eaten. there were 7 of us and the only people who liked their food were the kids and the one who had the pizza. \n\ni would never eat here again
0,"We just ate there on a Friday night and the whole experience was a disaster. Rude, unfriendly, just a miserable male server. Drinks were lousy , service was lousy, food just o.k., nothing to write home about, and at 9:00 on a Friday night they were putting chairs on the tables and vacuuming, hinting it was time for us to leave. The whole experince was horrible... and the bill was outrageous.  Save your money and Go somewhere else!!!!"
0,"I am not being hyperbolic when I say that my last experience here was the worst food experience I have ever had.\n\n I have eaten at Bado's before and have had pizza that was pretty tasty. So when my roomate wanted to go there, I was pretty excited. There were 4 of us. Two of us had burgers while the other two ordered wedding soup and shared potato skins. My burger was delicious. It was juicy and smothered in bleu cheese. \n\nWhile my food was really good, there were some issues with the other items ordered. Two of my guests cited that the wedding soup had a metalic taste to it while my other friend with the burger found a hair. Being a hairdresser and understanding that it does happen sometimes, she disregarded it and continued to eat her burger. Unfortunately, the hair did not stop there. Another guest found several hairs in their meal as well. We decided that we should let our waitress know. I stopped the waitress and explained how there was hair in two people's food. The waitress got upset and was very rude (it's not like we accused her of planting the hair herself). On top of this, she mistakenly took my burger and walked away with it, leaving the sullied food on the table. When she came back I told her that my burger was not one of the items with food on it and she instantly became defensive. At this point we asked for a manager (who never came) and insisted our meal get comped. Considering she threw out the only good food that we ordered, we didn't feel like that was asking too much. Luckily the waitress did not put up too much of a fight. \n\nI will never eat at Bado's again. A good cheese burger and a decent pie isn't enough when the staff can't even accept their own (human) mistakes. I have been places where there have been food issues before and I have also worked in a restaurant. I completely understand that mistakes happen. However, the reaction that we received was unacceptable."
0,Had the gnocchi delivered. Absolutely terrible. Gnocci's had to have been 2 years old. Delivery guy was shady too.
0,I don't like this place at all. The staff here is always rude and has no sense of care at all for their business. A couple years ago I had heard they smoke over making their pizza. All of their employees tend to be shady. I don't recommend at all.
0,"I wish there were negative stars I could put for this place.  One of the most unprofessional experiences I have ever had with a business owner, not even a worker.  I was yelled at, mocked, and generally treated like crap for checking up on a remounting job that was supposed to be done within a week.  Emotional mess the rest of the day.  I have never been treated that way with any owner of a business.   I work with restaurant owners for god's sake!   Unbelievable.   If you want the full story, email me and I will tell you the whole thing.  As it is right now, DO NOT patronize this business.   There was absolutely no excuse for his attitude."
0,"An abomination....the billing department is run by a level of incompetence of which the likes have never been seen.  Ever get a bill 2 yrs late, then pay over the phone with a credit card, only to have the payment never recorded and then receive harassing phone calls?  Well I just did...."
0,"Absolutely wretched and incompetent billing department.  Overcharged four months in a row, called every month and was repeatedly told it would be fixed.  I went to American Express to file a dispute and at least they were able to reverse the four overcharges.  Even after that, I was randomly charged for a system upgrade that never happened.  I am considering filing a complaint with the better business bureau and the attorney general."
0,"I tried to go here for the second time today.  I say tried because I sat at the bar for about 7 mins with 3 people walking around behind it and no one even acknowledging I was there.  I ended up going next door to The Map Room for lunch.\n\nThe first time I had gone I had a server come and take my order, a kitchen guy ran it out, and then no one ever came back for 45 mins.  I went to the counter for my check and thought that I wouldn't give it another go.  Well, you can't say I didn't try.\n\n I had the barbeque chicken pizza the first time and it wasn't bad, but its not a place I'd make my go to pizza place."
0,"While awaiting the arrival of your wedding dress, you should feel excitement and joy, not desparation and hopelessness.  The delivery date was \""pushed back\"" many times until it finally came in over 3 months after they said it would, and gave me the run-around throughout the entire process.  I didn't think my dress was coming at all to be perfectly honest.  I had un-returned phone calls and was lied to by Donetta, the owner.  Janie was the consultant I worked with the most and she was always pleasant and helpful; however, the store overall struggles and I would never go back.  If you are shopping for a wedding dress run far far away from this place.  Seriously, take my word for it.  I ordered my dress well in advance and no one should go through what I went through wondering when you were going to get a straight answer and if your dress was ever going to come.  I have read many negative reviews for this place and still gave them the benefit of the doubt. Shame on me.  Check out the Better Business Bureau (BBB).  Brides by Candalina is rated an F.  They have unresolved isssues with customers and unfortunately they really don't care. Shopping for a wedding dress should be one of the most exciting times of your life, not a nightmare.  There are many other bridal shops-avoid this one."
0,"I went to pick up my wife's bridesmaid dress (she was the maid of honor) on a very boring Wednesday afternoon around 12:30. From the outside the place looks like a bomb shelter with dresses in the window.\n\nThe show room is upstairs, but you would never know it from the drab, basement-like entrance. As I walked up the stairs I notices ZERO customers in the store, however; two employees were working on the sales floor. I stood there like a jerk for a bit while both employees (one was the owner) kept to themselves. The owner did not respond to me for, at least, 10 minutes even though the store was empty and another employee was just walking around \""dusting\"" (the store smalls like the inside of a mascot costume).\n\nWhen the owner, finally, saw me she made a little annoying noise like \""What the hell are YOU doing here!!\"". She walked over slowly, like a zombie looking for fresh brains and giving a crap why I was there. She asked me to follow her as she took me downstairs to an absolutely empty storeroom (by that I mean: what was she doing that was was so important that she couldn't wait on a customer) and took her sweet-ass time to get the dress which, by the way, was a second alteration. You see, they screwed up the first time they altered the dress (even after my wife tried it on there and markings or whatever were made!). So everyone is entitled to a mistake even a business that claims perfection; it's important to give them a chance to redeem themselves. But, to my surprise, she handed me a bill for the second alteration!!!!!! Are you kidding me?!!!\n\nI argued a bit, but then gave in; what was I supposed to do? We were leaving to go 200 miles away the next day for the wedding. So I paid. Do not go here ladies!\n\nOh, if you think I'm exaggerating, feel free to Google this company and read the many reviews that make mine look like a compliment. If you have ever needed a dress for a wedding or YOUR wedding, these reviews will scare you!"
0,"Last Friday I dropped off my best interview suit at Regency Cleaners and verified that I needed it back by Monday because of an interview on Wednesday. They assured me I could pick it up on Monday morning. \n\nMonday afternoon I stopped by and was told the suit wouldn't be there until 5:00PM. When I insisted that I had been told morning, she went into the back and came out with what I first thought was the suit but turned out to be only the jacket. She told me to come back after 5:00PM. When I asked to speak with the manager, she informed me that she was the only person there. I asked her to have the manager call me - she said the manager wouldn't answer the phone and reiterated the 5:00PM time when the last delivery came and petulantly informed me that none of this was her fault.\n\nAt 5:30PM I called and was told that the last delivery hadn't come yet and I'd have to call later. I again asked them to have the manager call me and she told me she couldn't give me the manager's phone number - which I hadn't asked for. I was again told this wasn't her fault. As of 7:00PM, the delivery finally arrived but not my pants.\n\nI was told the manager would call me after she arrived in the morning. I finally called at 9:00AM and was criticized by the manager for demanding her home phone number and told that there was never any guarantee about when clothes would be returned even when a rush was placed on them. \n\nApparently a *lot* of clothes were missing from the Monday delivery so I wasn't the only person upset about this situation.\n\nWhen I told them they'd lost my business for good, I was told that was fine and hung up on, forcing me to call again to find out exactly *when* I might be able to expect my missing pants.\n\nAt this point I'm still waiting and will be for the next three hours. In the meantime, I have to go out and try to find a suit that I can afford as a replacement just in case. \n\nI absolutely cannot recommend Regency Cleaners. They leave high school kids with no customer service experience or training in charge of the store with no manager available for unexpected situations. And there is no guarantee about when or if your clothes will ever come back.\n\nThis was my first and last time dealing with them."
0,"Worst dry cleaners EVER.  \n\nNot only do they do an incredibly poor job on the clothes, but the staff are particularly nasty and rude.  The kids who work there are fine, but the older ladies are just plain miserable.  I would rather spend more money someplace else than go back to this hell hole."
0,"I have been in this bar many times with a friend of mine (who has been a patron for decades) and I thought the owners were really nice people but now I wonder.  My friend is now confined to a wheelchair and still likes to frequent this bar, however, there are a couple of steps that lead into the back rooms where there are pool tables, dart boards, etc.  She cannot get to this area and has a ramp that she would give to the owners so she can access this area.  They refuse to put in the ramp.  I thought all public businesses had to comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act as long as it does not create an undue hardship.  Tell me, how is putting down a ramp that is given to you for free a hardship!  SHAME ON YOU CATHY!"
0,"Let me start off by saying, I HATE the dentist.  It is my worst fear.  I came to Edgewood Dental after stellar reviews.. and let me tell you my first impression was amazing.  They were professional, so nice, easily scheduled me in and numbed me so much that I didn't feel a thing.  Although I had 7 cavities filled (my teeth are horrible) I felt good that they did a good job.  Flash forward 3 months later, I received a bill in the mail because my insurance downgraded and no longer covered white fillings.  First, I was very upset that I was never told of this downgrade.  I was given an estimate and paid on time in full - not sure when this changed or why I was never told by the office or insurance company.  Regardless, I called over 5 times to discuss a payment plan with the office.  When I first emailed them, I was told I could choose the amount with which I wanted to pay to cover the amount owed.  Then, I was told my amount was too low and would get a call back.  NEVER HEARD FROM THEM AGAIN.  I was very upset.  I emailed, and called so many times.  Meanwhile, I have always paid everything on time and as an upstanding person would never not pay a bill.  I have been sending them checks and they are cashing them and just not even saying a word.  Jerks."
0,This place continues to be a joke.  The service is bad and the attitude of the workers is worse.  \n\nMy order is never right and yet I still go...never again.  \n\nI officially deem this place the worst restaurant in Pittsburgh.
0,Worst service.  Dirty.  Slow.  Ignorant by the strictest definition.  Do not go here.  Bad!  Real bad.
0,"Inattentive staff.  Dirty tables, I agree with the other reviews here.  I think the \""Manager\"" only hires other smokers, and they spend 90% of their time sitting outside smoking, instead of being prepared to serve customers.  \n\nI go there because sometimes it's convenient, b/c of the location, but last week they left their A/C broken for over a week (in 80+ degree weather).  No additional fans, nothing.\n\nThen when it was fixed, I went in, ordered coffee and an order of hummus/carrot/celery (prepackaged).  Not only was the hummus watery from sitting in that container for several days, but the celery was rotting at the ends, yes brown and rotting.  I showed the kid working there, who was probably jonesing to have his next cigarette, and I asked for another one.  Without opening it I could see at least 2-3 of the other servings of hummus were also all watery and had celery that was starting to rot, just like the one I was given.  I asked for my money back.  You know what was the worst thing, though?  The kid (he knows nothing about customer service let alone food service) put the containers with the watery, rotting celery back in the case, to serve to other unsuspecting customers!  Hello, Allegheny County Health Department?....\n\nThen the ultimate insult: 2 kids came in selling candy bars.  I've seen this there before, but this time, I said to them: \""You know, this is a business, you shouldn't be here.\""  Well, the older of the 2 girls (probably 11-12 at most - where is her mother?) put her hands on her hips and said in a smart-ass tone: \""We asked da owner, we is allowed ta be here.\""\n\nWell, that coffee I spent $2 on?  That is the last money I will spend in that place.  Disgusting."
0,"I really want this place to be awesome, because, yet again, I want Regent Square to be an up and coming area.  This place has been here for years, and as I sit drinking my bitter, bitter coffee, and smelling the overwhelming scent of (I believe) dog pee, I wonder how it's even possible.  \n\nThe three times I've been here, I'm greeted as if I'm a colonial space marine trying to fish a child out of a vent.  They always sit in the corner peeking over the top of the counter as if I am terrifying to them, then duck out of the way.  Then grudgingly come when I peek around the counter at them.  If I didn't, I'm convinced that they would just sit there, as if they're not certain of what position they hold in this place, or what the next step should even be.  This is what I like to call, \""The Dance of Shitty Customer Service.\""  \n\nToday (and I write this longingly looking over at Square Cafe) I decided to give it a chance because it never is crowded, and I figured the quiet would be a good thing.  The girl at the counter was on the phone, and that's the way it stayed for two minutes until I said 'excuse me?'.  The charming reply: \""Yeah?\"" She grudgingly got off the phone, and after accomplishing the Herculean task of handing me a cup, I pumped this swill that I'm currently drinking.\n\nShe's currently muttering under her breath back in her corner.  I'm not sure if maybe she's having a bad day, or she's just an asshole, but...if I had to bet, I'm going with asshole.\n\nThis place has pretty expensive coffee for how awful it is, and the food...Just don't eat the food.  \n\n(side note: this place isn't quiet at all when somebody orders something.  She stomps around like she's being sent to her room.  Then continues muttering)\n\nOkay, so this place is a travesty.  Bad coffee, bad odor, bad lighting, unbelievably bad, grudging service.  I would beg the owners to put any effort into this place.  As it is now, it's cornered the market in Regent Square, and sits like a middle finger boastfully pointing at the people of Braddock Avenue."
0,"Is it possible to give zero stars?  If so, Katerbean would rate a zero.\n\nBad atmosphere, unfriendly employees, slow and reluctant service, pump your own coffee, dingy interior, dirty tables.

0,This place is now closed :-). Best thing that could've been done with it.  Going to opn in a couple of months under new management as the 61B caf\u00e9. I look forward to seeing what some new life does to this place!
0,This store is so gross that I was almost sick! Onions peeled and half-rotten. Squishy garlic. Dirt everywhere. I will NEVER step foot in this place again.
0,One of the worst Wendy's I've ever experienced.  Every morning there was a 30-minute wait - after ordering - for food.
0,"Wow. I hope that the one experience I had here was unique and not the norm for frequent customers. All I wanted to do was to buy some thermal socks (which they didn't even have any for men!  ???). I just ended up grabbing the next best thing (Oddly, they did have thermal socks for women which I almost purchased). I go stand in the check out line, and I don't think I've ever dealt with slower people than those who work here (and that's saying something). Not one, but two of the registers I stood in line at froze, and the women had to wait for the manager to fix.  They didn't seem to mind at all, which leads me to believe this happens all of the time. I waited for my beau who bought something after I did: another 15 minute wait.  Needless to say, I will not go here again."
0,"First off, I like family restaurants and avoid chains when possible. Sometimes that's not possible - in the future I'll avoid this one no matter what.\n\nIts always a zoo, the servers are not interested in what they are doing, and do it poorly. Food comes out of order or not at all. The managers don't care. \n\nWe actually had a waitress spill the soup, catch most of it in her hand, and dump it back in right in front of us. Then she gave it to us before thinking to ask if we wanted another. \n\nJust go anywhere else, it can't be worse!"
0,"Normally one would think, one chain restaurant is just like the rest but I have had nothing but problems here. The staff appears to be constantly changing as does the managers which should tell you something. I've been there for lunch and dinner and continue to have issues. Here are just some of the problems that we have had: a co-worker had an entire glass of iced tea dropped on him and nothing was comped on his check; we have had to wait a very long time for our orders to be taken; I ordered the pick 2 and was told that the soup could not possibly come out first(even though I've done this before); they have argued with us over what the meal is supposed to come with to the point of us showing them a picture; and staff does not appear to be properly trained."
0,"Another overdone steak and utterly inattentive staff! Still sitting here waiting for someone to give a care.\n\nSo, we finally got the attention of a server who was not our server, Michael. She was kind enough to take my steak back to the kitchen. Michael, our server, finally shows up 10 minutes later with a half-hearted apology and to let me know that my steak was being prepared again. He does not offer to refill our drink glasses that have now been sitting empty for 20 minutes. The manager makes an appearance and brings me a strip steak that looks rare from the sight of it. He informs me that my steak is on him and apologizes. He goes away. I cut into my steak and it's, you guessed it, Pittsburgh Rare. I asked for medium rare. He returns and I tell him that the chef needs to go back to culinary school and learn how to prepare a steak. The manager apologizes again and asks me if I want to take this pathetic piece of beef home with me! Not only is it rare but it's a cheap cut of strip steak that is loaded with connective gristle. I said no thanks. He comped my husband's meal and we left. I never hope for people to lose their jobs but the cook and the server really need some serious retraining! I will never go back to this Applebee's again."
0,"Benihana.  It's just rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?  No, unfortunately not.at.all...anymore.  From hence forth, all mentions of Benihana are likely to cause anxiety in my usually calm heart.  I hate complaining like this. I really do. But sometimes, you just have to, ya know?\n\nTuesday evening I met a group of friends for a birthday dinner.  The reservation for our party of nine was for 7:00pm.  All but one of our party arrived prior to 7:00, but the hostess was curt in explaining that all party members needed to be present before we were seated, as our chef would be ready to begin meal preparation as soon as we were seated.  Fortunately, the final member of our party arrived shortly and we were seated at 7:05pm.  It was not until 7:40pm that first contact with our server was made. Without any apology for the delay she took our drink orders.  She (name withheld because I don't want to be rude) returned more than 10 minutes later with our drinks, but waited another 10-15 minutes after that to take our dinner orders.  As I was waiting I looked over at the table next to us, who were also clearly celebrating a child's birthday.  At one point the mother (I'm assuming) smiled at me and said, \""I hope you get out before midnight. We've been here over two hours.  We're taking our cake and getting out of here.\""\n\nUpon taking our orders, one of our guests explained that due to a shrimp allergy it was necessary to cook any shrimp ordered by our group in another area (a neighboring grill, etc.).  Our server said that she would have to ask the manager, who came to our table shortly thereafter.  When the manager arrived at the table my guest explained her allergy and his response was that it might be in her best interest to leave.  I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt that he meant leaving the table, not the restaurant, but I'm not certain of this. Following this recommendation he mentioned that she could wait in the bar as the rest of us dined table-side.  I asked him why it was not an option to prepare the shrimp at a neighboring table, but he expressed concern that other customers may require the use of the other available tables.  I understand his point, but the restaurant was near-empty as the hour quickly approached 8:30pm.  Finally, he offered to prepare the shrimp portions of our meals in the kitchen.  I'm not sure why this wasn't initially mentioned as an option, but I'll leave it at that.  \n\nOur chef Tom eventually arrived at our table. He was very pleasant and efficient during the course of our meal preparation.  During his time at the table my Emperor's Salad was delivered, as were the majority of my table's sushi orders.  However, two of our guests that ordered sushi were not served at this time.  In fact, they were not served until a full 10 minutes after the rest of our party finished our meals.  At one point, they inquired about the delay to she-whose-name-shall-not-be-mentioned, who responded that they were \""waiting for the rice.\""  When she delivered their food there was not a single mention of the delay.  \n\nTwo hours and thirty+ minutes after we arrived at Benihana, we left.  From start to finish, the entire evening was a terrible experience.  It was ridiculous to the point that there was not even soap or toilet paper available in the restroom.  Were it not for the kindness and professionalism of Tom (and the awesome company of friends), the night would have been a complete waste.  \n\nMy final thought is this. The food was fine, but because I was feeling particularly piggish on this Tuesday evening, I enjoyed two California rolls from my stash of Costco sushi at home before departing for the restaurant. The difference between Costco's rolls and Benihana's...a toss up - just sayin.  The good news is, this will give my friends something to whine about for YEARS to come..."
0,"Many great memories and great experience at Benihana BUT last night WAS NOT! Horrible service! Took 15 mins to even take a drink order...then when I had a question about a speciality wine the waiter says he didn't know so ok no big deal, could he go find.. NO! Told me to go the bar and ask the bartender. Really?!? Then the chef came out and was pretty good although cooked everything separate starting  with only onions and zucchini, where's the veggies?? From start to finish it was about half an hour! If we ate the dinner as a whole it would've been cold.. So we ate as we went. Also drink refills were a tough task too.. the chef had to keep asking other servers to assist. few and far between!! We had 3 birthdays at our table.. Not one song , which I didn't care, not one complimentary picture, no dessert was offered until another customer said something. Then the bill.. Oh the bill... That took another 15 mins!! At this point I told my family to go ahead home and I will wait considering this overall experience was almost a 2 hour ordeal. I was double charged on two items. At this point I was DONE dealing with this incompetent and appethetic waiter!!! Went to settle my bill with the manager who was nice and accommodating. Rectified the errors. And was generous with a $20 refund! I told him about the experience and all he said was \""I can take picture now for you\"" UM... I was by myself!!! No thanks! One last thing, the male greeter needs some drug intervention.. He was high as a kite and made my daughter & I feel very uncomfortable to the point of invading our personal space and staring with those glazed over eyes as he staggered to and from his post. WOW & BOO!!! And sad : ("
0,"This is by the far the worst hibachi restaurant I have eaten at. The food is very bland from the onion soup to the fried rice (which basically was white rice with chopped onions) to the chicken (which was so pale it looked like it was boiled). Hibachi food typically has tons of flavor and tastes good because it has some grill marks and char, which none of our food had. I question whether it was even cooked on the hibachi table (we ate at a regular table but ordered from the hibachi menu). Not only was the food bad but the service was terrible. Our waiter didn't even know that hibachi dinners should come with the two sauces, he acted confused when I asked for them. Additionally, we ordered a sushi roll for an appetizer and instead of getting it before dinner, we received it after our dinner even though we saw it sitting at the sushi bar for a good 15 minutes beforehand. This restaurant may have been around for a long time but it doesn't even compare to other hibachi restaurants and was more expensive than any other I've eaten at."
0,This place is crappy the only veggies u get is onions and zucchinis took the server 30 min to serv us drinks then took them 20 min to take orders by the time the chef comes out already an hour just for the food and the show after we ate our waiter didnt even recommend anny desserts just gave us the chek and leave with out saying anny thing els o i for got we were still eating like wtf im still eating and so was mi family and u just give me the check the chef just left like five min ago . I recamen go sime where els n eat
0,"This is the WORST Hibachi I have ever had.  We came here for a friends birthday, and I will never be going back. Service was mediocre, but the food was the real travesty.\nYou go to Hibachi for a show, but it's not fun when the cook makes the SAME Giant Eagle joke the entire time.  He also couldn't perform all the tricks that are pretty standard from Hibachi chefs.  The food. Not good.  My boyfriend ordered tofu and it was cold in the middle.  He didn't bother to have the guy heat it more, b/c it would have just been a hassle.  The chef forgot one friends meal completely and got rude with the server.  Then after everything was cooked, he looked at me and asked did you eat all your shrimp. I replied \""no, you never served me any.\"" (I had ordered the chicken and shrimp.)  He then sends the server back into the kitchen to get more. By the time they were cooked, everyone was finished eating.  Come on.  To make matters worse, when we left we saw that he was the head chef. That doesn't say too much for the rest of them. \nI don't know how people keep coming here.  There is WAY better hibachi in Pittsburgh, for a lot less money.  I mean honestly, I paid $9.50 for a glass of Kendall Jackson. No. \nThe best part of the meal were the cupcakes that my friend brought.  Do your wallet and your stomach a favor and go to a different Hibachi place.  Benihana is not worth your time or money."
0,"We went to the Mad Mex in Cranberry Twp and won't make the mistake of going back. \n\nThe food was horribly hot, like they just toss in heat for heat's sake, rather than for taste. I ordered the mole chicken enchiladas and that was NOT any kind of mole I've ever had. The sauce was more like a weak, thin ranchero sauce and both the sauce and the chicken was too hot. Even the guacamole was too hot. \n\nI recognize this restaurant chain is trying to be a trendy \""fusion\"" of Tex-Mex and CA, but they failed. Luckily, they are in the same parking lot as a pharmacy so I was able to walk straight over for some Tums.\n\nIf you want GOOD Tex-Mex, go to El Campo in Monaca or El Paso Mexican Grill in Chippewa. Both restaurants are excellent examples of good Tex-Mex, similar to the styles typically served in Central California."
0,This afternoon I took my 4 year old to this mad mex for lunch after a great morning swimming and doing a yoga class.  We had to send back our food because the chicken was stone cold (even though surrounded by sizzling veggies on a skillet).  It seemed like it was yeterday's chicken.  They brought out fresh food and I'm kicking myself for having eaten it.  The rest of our day has been spent cleaning up food poisoning accidents and in the bathroom.
0,"While I LOVE Mad Mex, this one is to be avoided.  For whatever reason, they always seem to manage to mess up orders and on a couple of occassions, I've just not felt well after eating there.  Because it's a BB, I just keep thinking I had to be wrong about that.  But after waking up in the middle of the night with all sorts of unpleasant stomach issues, I've had to write this location off.  Go to Robinson instead... (Or BB, please, please get a new KM for this location!)"

These limitations can be overlooked. What can't be forgiven, however, is the shabbiness of this place. It looks like it gets vacuumed once a week, and the bathrooms are disgusting."
0,"Stopped for dinner there while traveling on business.  Greeted by a friendly hostess, seated and ignored.   After 25 minutes without a server, I left.  Will not recommend to anyone else passing through.  I don't know if all the wait staff didn't feel like serving one person because tips are smaller for one than a group or if they were just incompetent or just rude.  Extremely dissatisfied."
0,Went there on my first day in Pittsburg. Wasn't the best experience. My waitress was to busy talking to her coworkers that she couldn't even give us any sauces. The food was ok but nothing to great. When I go back to Pittsburg I will not be going there again!!!!
0,"Absolutely horrible service, when we entered the hostess gave an audible sigh like we were inconveniencing her with our presence.  We were seated for over 10 minutes and never had a server come to even take drink orders.  Needless to say we left, and we will not be going back."
0,Frequently get take out from this place. Food usually fairly decent. Except we found some type of flying bug in the bottom of our rice container. Called to complain and they offered 20% off our next bill and did not sound surprised by our find. Considering the money we have spent there over the years I was highly upset. But they seemed to care less. Guess I have to drive to sesame next time.
0,Consumer alert... rats!
0,A while back my Mom bought some donuts from here and they were really stale by the next day.  She called and mentioned something about it to them and they didn't even seem to care.  I like to try and support local business but with an attitude like they showed I have no use for them.  Doesn't seem to be any real set hours so you never know when they will be open.
0,"Darren's recent review of Kmart got me thinking about this place. I was out this way recently and I stopped to look for a place to eat. Man, talk about a dead mall! Parkway Center Mall even has its own listing on www.deadmalls.com I'd only been here once or twice back in its heyday. Back then it had Chi-Chi's (where thankfully I never ate. A hepatitis scare did them in), David Weis, Pharmor, CompUsa, Syms, etc were all here. \n\nNow the mall is mainly deserted. Only one floor is still open, and even that's got a vacancy rate of about 50%! Surprisingly what remains seems to be doing good business. Kmart is doing okay as is the Giant Eagle. Phantom of the Attic is alive and well and so is Pittsburgh Sports Deli. That's not an eatery either. It's a sports memorabilia store. \n\nThere wasn't much reason for me for me to linger here though.  I soon left and went over to Olive Garden for lunch."
0,"What a depressing shell of a mall... \n\nI remember when it was *the* mall to go to... CompUSA, Pharmor, Kmart, Playless, Joann Fabrics, ChiChis, Giant Eagle... \n\nHell, CompUSA, ChiChis and Pharmor don't even exist anymore... I'm not sure if Kmarts are still in business. \n\nDead malls are sad, for some reason. Walking through this mall just creepy though."
0,"Truly the worst mall in America.  Going here is like being in a time machine though.  There is a store called \""90's Nails\"" for goodness sakes.\n\nHow is this place even still standing?  For one, I'm pretty sure it's built on an old mine or dig or something.  My mom has told me you can feel the ground move when you are here.  Yikes!\n\nThe Sports Deli is actually a gem of a store though.  Man, the rent has to be so cheap!\n\nI got to give a shout out to Petland (I think that's what it is/was called) the pet store in this mall where we got our Maltese pup Sno-Flake 17 years ago!  What a great dog!  :)"
0,"Honestly I don't consider this place a mall. I consider it to be the entryway I have to use to get into K-Mart. Sadly there are a few stores left still lingering around but hey, I'm sure the rent is reasonable considering the land is falling apart. Calling it a mall is like calling me an athlete it simply isn't true. When you can lists off the name of the stores on your fingers and still have a few left over then you need to go somewhere else."
0,"Oy vey! Stay away, there's nothing here to see. Kmart, Phantom of the attic and a lottery place. This mall is dead! Deader than dead, dead dead!"
0,I ordered food that I believed was gluten free.  Within twenty minutes I started to have symptoms and was sick for two days.  I believe that my food may have been gluten free but that cross contamination caused my problem.  I had the same experience at another Pittsburgh Olive Garden restaurant and so am concluding that they may not be careful with cross contamination.
0,"Avoid at all costs!  They diluted my wine with water, the food was mushy, they charged me $3.25 for marinara sauce from A CAN (without informing us beforehand this injustice would be taking place)!  Typical big corporation: cut costs down to last nickel and inflate the prices so the CEO can fly in his private jet (after landing, eat at a REAL Italian restaurant) and purchase a new Bentley each year.  \n\nVisit DeBlasio's Restaurant for twice the portions; it is MUCH CHEAPER, as well.\n\nWorst experience at a restaurant... EVER!"
0,Ten minute wait and easily most tables are open!!! Surprise it's lunch time!!!! I just passed six tables empty and clean. Beyond me...
0,"This used to be the Holiday Inn and now it is the Clarion Hotel & Conference Center.  We needed to find a place not too far from Heinz Stadium for a reasonable price. We paid about $90 per night for this place, and the experience started poorly. We walked in and the two lobby TVs were tuned to Judge Judy (for the front desk employee's viewing pleasure). Employees watching reality TV during business hours really puts me off. It was hard to get the attention of the front desk staff because they were in the middle of a pizza order.  Two of the staff was working the front desk with a third suggesting toppings. It was pretty funny as one of clerks started to set up our room while another on the phone to the pizzeria kept interrupting the process with pizza questions. To the side the third clerk assisted with the pizza order. My wife pointed out her extreme cleavage, but I did not want to get lost there. We had a hard time understanding our clerk setting up the room. She tended to mumble, but did assert herself better when responding to pizza order questions. We finally got our room and headed up the very scary elevator to the 4th floor. In a way I felt as if we were at some sort of slum. I kept looking for gang tagging. The room was adequate (and I believe this was a renovated room), but a Motel 6 would be an upgrade. Whoever is doing the renovation has really poor taste and the quality of work is terrible. The swimming pool was a swamp (I am not kidding), but I am sure the frogs living in it were having a good time. The next morning we went down to the front desk again. This time the morning clerk was on a personal call and gave me an angry look because she felt that I was interrupting her call.  She did not even hang up; she just put the phone to her side, answered my question, and then continued her conversation. \n\nPersonally, I think this hotel would be great for a horror movie and Hollywood should contact this place. It needs to be knocked down, or management should tighten up the staff and improve construction quality. If construction is on track (and I suspect something is wrong), get staff that really is gracious to customers. There are people that need jobs out there and I assure you with proper management they will do a great job. Don't stay here for over $45 per night (the price is due to the breakfast offered). Personally I would not stay here until they fix the place, but for some reason I don't feel that it will ever happen. Something just feels wrong. Perhaps Clarion has stopped the remodel due to the economy."
0,Umm lol so seriously I read some reviews about this place and was like NOOOO it can't be that bad. HA HA....DUDE! So this spot is like mad cheap but REALLY? \n\nFirst we check in and notice the are undergoing some much needed renovations. Checkin was seamless as it should be. We get to out room #122 and after reading the reviews I know to check the beds immediately. The first bed legit has hair under the sheets...strike 1. As I'm pulling the covers back on the second bed I find two quarters...that's right folks! Obviously left by the last guest intentionally to warn the next occupants that the SHEETS HAVEN'T BEEN CHANGED...let alone checked. I mean really? You couldn't at lease have made it look like you did your jobs?\n\nWe go to the desk and make them aware of the issue. They apologetically get us another room. This room is better its evident by the way these beds were made that the room has been cleaned. The elevator by the desk is stuck on the 3rd floor lol death trap so we take the stairs. Thank God for yelp....You've all been warned lol SERIOUSLY!
0,"This was technically the Clarion hotel so I think the name is wrong on the page. \n\nI'd like to start by saying that I'm not much of a complainer, but if could have given 0 stars, I would have. \n\nSo we are on our way up to room when we passed a vending machine with water underneath it. I assumed it was leaking and brushed it off. I don't care that much about little things like that especially since we were just sleeping there. After a great hockey game and a bar crawl, we came back to the hotel and got ready for bed. There was absolutely no hot water for my shower. So cold I wouldn't even consider hopping in really quick. It was late so I let it go and decided to try again in the morning. When I woke up it was the same thing. At this point I was fuming. I NEED a shower man!\n\nSo I put on my angry pants and headed down the hall towards the elevator. Right in front of the elevator door there is a water fall pouring out of the ceiling from the third floor. \""What the hell....\"" is pretty much what I was thinking at this point. Well there was my shower considering I had to walk through it to continue on my quest. As soon as the elevator doors open to the first floor, I see the hallway is flooded. The carpet is squishing beneath my feet all the way to the front desk where other angry people had beaten me to. Apparently a pipe had burst the day before and they had neglected to tell us that when we had checked in. I was so mad. I managed to get 70% off our bill and I made her call to check us in at another hotel. I would have insisted the whole bill be paid for but I'm really bad at being mean to people. All in all, I will never stay here or any other branch of this hotel again."
0,"we checked out 4 rooms just to see what it was like, moldy ceilings,  musty smells, unclean rooms, and such a huge renovation job it should be shut down or discounted by 99%! thank god hotwire gave us a refund."
0,"Nightmare.  It's a ghost town. Needles in parking lot. \""Lobby\"" is a hotel room with undesirables hanging around. Asked to see our rooms before checking in, given the key, room was filthy.  Saw a sticky note re: bedbugs.  Bolted, as fast as possible."
0,"I'm not sure I can even give this place one star. To be fair, the room we had was clean and comfortable. It did seem as if we had entered a time warp, though. Furnishings and bedding from the 70's...if not 60's! I've seen this place rated up to 3 stars on some websites. I'd like to know their qualifications!!\nWhen you first approach the hotel, it looks closed down. (And write obviously, it should be!!) You enter through a side entrance with hand written signs. The\""office\"" is a room right inside the doors. The hallway looks a wreck! (Oh yeah...they're under construction!!) Dirt, filth, and stains everywhere. Electrical wires exposed, smoke detectors hanging down. You look at all this and wonder how in the world are they passing codes?? (Or are they?!? Hmmmm)\nLike I said...the room was better..although not without faults. The lights over the bathroom sink did not work, and the shower did not work well. The tv was definitely a 1980's model. Wireless internet?? What a joke!! \nWhen we reported the bathroom issues, they said they would move us to another room. Since we were only staying 2 nights, we thought we would stay and just have maintenance look at it in the morning. We were informed maintenance would not be in tomorrow!! (Our ever??)\nWe told the lady working the \""front desk\"" that this hotel was pretty scary. Her reply was, \"" yeah, we get that a lot!\"""
0,"Ah, yes, what has yet to be said about this Clarion in Greentree, which is commonly known as the hotel of perpetual construction? Check the reviews folks (I sure wish I had) and you'll see that this place has been under construction for at least four years!\nMy family, and I'm sure countless others, initially had trouble even finding the place and had to humble ourselves to ask directions at the nearby Doubletree Hotel. But even with directions, we drove right past the Clarion because: 1). There are no hotel signs; 2). We were arriving at night and the building was completely dark; 3). There were no parked cars visible from the road; and 4). The entire front of the building was boarded up.\nWhen we located the correct driveway and approached the construction zone, which once represented the entrance to the hotel, we saw a tiny sign directing us to the \""Temporary Lobby\"" in the back of the hotel. The makeshift lobby consisted of a hotel room with a clerk sitting at a desk. The clerk initially could not locate our reservation on her computer, but found it as soon I had dug through my luggage to find a copy of the confirmation email.\nWe were given a room on the second floor, thus we walked past stairwells that were closed (because of endlessly drying 'wet paint') and an out-of-order (and leaking) ice machine, until we located the elevator. Well, let me tell you folks, Disney's Tower of Terror ride is less frightening than this elevator. It looked like one of those service elevators that the public never sees. The floor was covered in dead bugs and the ceiling had holes in it, leading to the conclusion that someone must have taken the globes off the ceiling lights and just dumped the dead bugs onto the floor.\nWhen we got to our room, the carpet was so covered with nasty grease stains that we wanted to keep our shoes on. We did the preliminary check of the beds and found some stained sheets, but thankfully no bugs. We also checked for the free Wi-Fi signal and found that it was completely useless (maybe that's why the desk clerk couldn't locate our reservation).\nFinding the complimentary breakfast in the morning was like a scavenger hunt, where you look for clues on small paper signs in the hallways. The adventure actually took me outside of the hotel and then back into another part of the building (thankfully it wasn't raining like it had been all night). I then realized that I had just entered the main construction zone and the outside route must be the only passable route to the dining area.\nThere was yet another sign outside the dining room which said something about Complementary Breakfast and the strange phrase \""Gratuity Included.\"" But inside the dining room there were at least two clearly-marked 'Tip Jars.' Now, I've been at some pretty trashy hotels in my travels, but I've never seen a tip jar in the dining room. I've also never been in a hotel dining room where it looked like a bomb had gone off, but there were drop cloths, power tools and all sorts of debris everywhere.\nWhen I got in line for the grub, I learned how the attendant earned her tips: she was there to help patrons identify the food. The person in front of me inquired about the gray-looking sausage-like links and was dutifully informed that they represented turkey sausage, adding, \""Because Clarion cares about your health.\"" I'm not kidding (who could make something like that up?). Anyway, I tried this so-called health food, because the only other hot alternative was French Toast and I did not want any syrupy food that morning. Guess what? The sausage had some kind of sugary additive to make the links taste like syrup! Real healthy, right? Thus, I ended up just getting a cup of coffee and returning to my room to pack up. The coffee was okay, by the way.\nIn conclusion, I would not have stayed at the Greentree Clarion had I not made prior reservations and had not been coming back after midnight following a music festival where it rained all day. Plus, we used our loyalty points for this room, so I couldn't even request a discount.\nBelieve me, HUD would shut this place down if it was an apartment building and the Dept. of Homeland Security would never even consider housing immigrants there. But, of course, you and I are welcome to pay upwards of a hundred bucks a night to stay there."
0,"This was by far the worst hotel experience I've ever had. It wasn't just that there was MASSIVE construction going on, but they did nothing to accommodate for it. They put us in a dirty floor with exposed ceilings, spackle, and sheetrock everywhere. The lights were broken and the room was filthy. \n\nThe second room they out me in had an air conditioning unit that wouldn't reach the outlet, rendering it useless in the middle of the summer, had no toilet paper and water all over the bathroom floor. \n\nThe CHILDREN working the front desk, which was located in a hotel room, gave the worst customer service, greeted me with an attitude, and couldn't manage to pull themselves away from their own conversation long enough to even check me in in a timely manner. \n\nThe worst. Do not stay here."
0,"Wish I could give this place negative stars. Where to begin? It begins with no signs saying where the hotel is at. And then it goes into their \""temporary lobby\"" which is a room turned into an office. The whole place is under construction which wouldn't be so bad, but my gosh they have crap EVERYWHERE!!! That leads us to the elevator. Norman bates would even say it's too creepy for him. It's marked with two different hotel names on top of that, holiday inn and ramada. Then the room. Not the worst of the worst, the decor is nice, the bed is as hard as a rock and the shower isn't even properly installed. Really wish I would have looked at yelp before booking here. Buyer beware. Oh yea! AND I knew they were under construction before we booked in June, and we were promised that the construction would be done before hand. Extremely disappointed."
0,"What a crock!   The thin bagel (with asparagus/mushrooms, swiss)...you get mostly cheese...it doesn't look at all like the picture on your website depicting a load of asparagus smothered in mushrooms...so full of it; definitely not worth the price. \n(this was the one in Greentree)"
0,"Worst effin Starbucks on the block and their baristas suck at making drinks. Horrible customer service and they ALWAYS screw up our orders. I just don't understand why they're so lazy. I understand their comprehension level is low because of the lack of education though. But, if you hate your job, don't take it out on the loyal customers! Your life sucks, we get it, but you have ONE job at Starbucks, so do it right. It's not hard."
0,"Came here for a \""quick\"" breakfast on our way from the hotel to Fallingwater, and regretted the decision immensely.\n\nExtremely long lines, and poorly trained staff. As a former employee, I know about staff roles and approximately how long it should take to receive your drink. This staff was not trained at all, and it was clear that they were overwhelmed with the crowd. It took me 32 minutes for me to receive my order (there were 7 customers in front of me), and my order was incorrect. I ordered a small coffee, medium latte, a croissant and a sausage breakfast sandwich. I know that the sausage sandwiches heat up for about 40 seconds in oven, so I can't comprehend why it took so long to get my order. Would never come here again. I also received a WARM cheese danish instead of my croissant. First, the warm, creamy colored goo in the middle is extremely unappetizing, and second, they looked so dejected when I pointed out that I ordered a croissant I almost just left.\n\nDo not recommend."
0,"I guess this will be my last good review for Princess nails. Unfortunately the worst possible thing has happened. I have one eyebrow! Its slowly growing back but the idea of having to pencil in my eyebrow everyday is starting to get to me. \n\nUnfortunately I don't know what happened? Michelle are you going blind? Are you okay? Obviously you left me with completely a mishapen eyebrows which I had to have someone else fix because you botched mine. I cried, I weeped, i found myself in the fetal position. I'm no longer going back. \n\nI know some people have off days but this was BAD."
0,"By far the worst Shellac manicure I have ever had. I went down on my lunch break for a quick mani. First the woman rushed through my \""manicure.\"" I'm not sure they have any type of sanitizer for their instruments as she kept pulling things out of her drawer. The manicure was very quick and not at all thorough. Once she started to paint my nails she kept having to fix them because she was in a such a rush. She took off polish that was on the nail and then pushed my hand into the UV dryer. When she went to put the top coat on my Shellac she put the Foundation coat on 2 of my nails before she realized and wouldn't fix them saying they will be fine. During the entire process she did about 6 eyebrow waxes and then would forget where she was in my process. She also kept forgetting to turn on the UV dryer to the point where she walked away and I had to turn it on.\n\nDo not go here. If I could give it 0 stars I would."
0,"I got a good haircut here a few months ago, so this one-star review is not intended for the stylists.  It is a response to a strict no-returns policy on salon products, which makes me pretty mad: I couldn't have known they recommended the wrong product without trying it, and now that I tried it, they won't refund my purchase.  Catch-22.  I came in to buy a replacement for my normal bumble and bumble curl creme for thick hair, and was told by the receptionist that bumble and bumble's \""defining creme for fine curls\"" is the new packaging of that product (which seemed weird to begin with...thick hair..fine curls...) Nope, it's totally different and it doesn't work for me.  I used it twice, figured that out, and now I'm stuck with an expensive product I can't use. I called bumble and bumble and they told me that the product I use has been discontinued.  All my previous salons in other cities would have honored a return in this situation.  I won't be back to MCN."
0,"I have been sitting here looking at the poor quality of my shellac manicure and I just had to write. I walked in to Kenny's nail salon this afternoon and was pleased that there wasn't a wait. They also provided very friendly customer service.\n\nHowever, my manicure looks terrible! It looks like I painted my nails myself, only even I could do better. The paint and clear gel is all over the underside of my nails and baked on, no less. I'm even finding paint on my fingers now. The nail technician, a female, didn't even touch my cuticles, but she did use an electric file to shave down the nail bed. I guess that's supposed to count for the cuticles? No frills, no hand massage, not even any moisturizer or cuticle oil or anything.\n\nI am horrified I was charged $25 and then I even tipped 20%. Now I'm wishing I would have asked them to start over, perhaps with a different nail technician. I won't be going back, however. At least I was in and out in 25 minutes. But what a terrible job."
0,Very sloppy! No attention the polish is all over my fingers so disappointing and aggravating that now I'm going to have to pay more money else where to get them redone
0,"They suck!! First of all not even 24 hours after I got acrylics one broke, then they painted on the french white tips which is fine, however they did such a poor job. When I came back to ask for a refund they were very rude about it and refused to help. I have gotten my nails done almost for a year and I have never seen such a poor job. DO NOT GO HERE."
0,"The worst experience ever. I have never complained about my nails bc im pretty laid back but this was insane. The man that was doing my nails had an incredibly shaky hands, cut me more times than I can count, and have the nails literally one and a half times the size of my nail beds. I got pink and white and the white was not uniform among any of the nails and usually wasn't even uniform from one side of the nail to the other . . On 1 of my nails the white was 3 eights of an inch on 1 side and 1 eighth on the other. The equipment to scrub the nails was unsanitary and in a dirty cup. I have never had such a negative experience anywhere and I kept trying to explain what was wrong to the man and he just wouldn't listen. He did not smooth down any of the nails until the third time I complained about it. I spent $85 at the salon and have to go and get them redone by a different technician tomorrow because I don't even trust them to redo their mistakes"
0,"I wish i could give this place no stars! we sat for lunch after a lunch rush there were 2 other table in the restaurant besides ours, we ordered a blt with chili and a cesar salad....1 hour latler a stale BLT and chili that looked like it had been sitting there for 2 hours comes out. I was still waiting for my cesar salad. The chili was cold and the blt bread was so hard you couldnt bite into it. When we asked to speak to the manager the waitress got very defensive... the manager came over and explained that is their food and how its made so he wasnt sure of the problem. After an argument going back and forth ensued he agreed to comp the meals. Here is the kicker haha...we were going to leave the waitress a tip because clearly it was not her fault however, she came over and asked if our problem was resolved we said yes and then she rolled her eyes and walked away. No tip for you my friend. This is not how you do business especially when there are other options BESIDES SOHO to choose from for lunch."
0,Nice looking place and the worst service i've had in the last 20 years.   After waiting 10 minutes to have a bartender at a less than half full bar acknowledge us we then ordered and the drinks arrived.  Hope you only need one round because after waiting 30 minutes to try to order a second round we paid with exact change to save us from wasting another hours of our life.   It is hard to explain how oblivious the bar tenders were.
0,"No redeeming qualities here. Schwill on tap. Food was terrible - had the pizza, mac & cheese bites, and spinach & artichoke dip.  It was hardly edible. Stay away."
0,"Stayed @ the hotel. Ordered sirloin steaks. No steak knife, no mashed potatoes, no asparagus as ordered. So, Check your order. I mean for a 2 person $50 meal with tip I would hope the waitstaff would deliver on what was ordered & asked before we left. \n\nBut skip the 20%, $10 room service fee & http://www.sohopittsburgh.com. walk downstairs."
0,"Terrible.\n\nI visited this restaurant for the first time yesterday to use up a Groupon.  Thank God I didn't pay full price for this slop.  \n\nFirst, lets talk about the decor.  Others have commented about the outdated 80s look of the place. I concur.  The chairs are ridiculously heavy and uncomfortable.  And don't even get me started on the hideous glass constructions hanging from the ceiling.  \n\nSecond, let talk about the staff.  Unprofessional to say the least.  When we were waiting for our table, I witnessed the hostess yell at a man from across the restaurant, instead of walking up to him and guiding him to his party.  \""Hey Anthony, your party's over here!\""  Ridiculous. \n\nThis restaurant has an open kitchen, which is usually a good thing - but not when everyone's yelling at each other.  We were seated near the kitchen and, I'm not exaggerating, heard someone yell \""order!\"" approximately every 30 seconds.  Staff yelled at each other from across the restaurant constantly.  I felt like I was on a playground.  \n\nOur waitress was a nice, sweet girl, and she did the best she could considering the environment she was in.  I have no complaints about her.  \n\nThe food, though... Jesus.  We started with the \""margarita shrimp cocktail\"".  Imagine tiny round pieces of popcorn shrimp floating in a glass of lime flavored water.  These were served with tortilla chips, which you'd think were meant to be used to scoop up the shrimp from the glass.  But, the shrimp are solid round balls, not a scoopable salsa.  We tried picking up the shrimp with the chips, but they'd just roll off and end up on the floor.  My date and I just laughed as we TRIED to eat this concoction.  When it finally made it into our mouths, it was gross anyway.  \n\nMy boyfriend ordered a sushi/sashimi combo platter.  I'm being generous by giving it a rating of mediocre.  Take out sushi from a grocery store is better.  \n\nNow, I admit, I made the mistake here - I ordered the fried fish platter.  I'm used to getting a variety at seafood restaurants.  At a place like Mitchell's Fish Market, you can get a dish with a piece of fish, a few scallops, a few shrimp, and a vegetable.  The Original Fish Market has no such dish.  The only dish I could get that had more than just one piece of fish with some plain steamed white rice and steamed spinach, was the fried fish platter.  So, I ordered that, with a side of green beans (vegetables were $5 - $7 extra).\n\nThe description said I would get a piece of tilapia, scallops, oysters, shrimp, and french fries.  I didn't realize this meant that the tilapia was fried, the scallops were fried, the oysters were fried, and the shrimp was fried, all on top of a giant bed of fried french fries.  It's just not what I pictured.  Like I said, it was my mistake for not reading carefully and not asking the waitress, but lets say for argument's sake that this is what I wanted.  \n\nIt was still disgusting.  The batter/flavor was exactly the same for everything.  The scallops tasted like the french fries.  The shrimp tasted like the french fries, the tilapia tasted like the french fries.  I didn't even try the oysters, but I'm pretty sure they would have tasted like french fries.  I ate barely a quarter of this dish, and I'm pretty sure I consumed an entire week's worth of saturated fat.  If you ate this entire plate, I think a heart attack would interrupt your dessert.\n\nThe green beans were good. \n\nOther people commented that you can't count on hotel restaurants being worthwhile.  I have to agree.  If everyone's just passing through, you don't have to worry about actually impressing anyone and getting them to come back.  And with business travelers, they're usually paying with their company's dime, so they don't bother to complain or expect much.\n\nI have learned my lesson.  I'm not coming back.  And I seriously question the sanity of people who gave this place more than two stars."
0,"I have never had such awful, inedible food at such an appallingly ridiculous price. It's not only a failure in execution, the plates are very poorly put together, and the flavors of the sides and sauces with the protein do not marry well at all. I was severely disappointed by plating, and then just got mad when I started eating.\nYou would think for 44$ your steak would at least be properly cooked. What was supposed to be medium, came raw. The steak was tough and tasteless. \nAhi tuna, asked rare, was overcooked; also bland, even with the sauce. The oshinko side was laughable. Seriously. I laughed. \n\n pasta was overcooked, and by the time it got to us, the sauce was laminated with coagulating fat. \nThe sushi was an amatuer attempt at best.  There was too much rice, and presentation was sad. \nAmbience is tacky. Ugly 80s-reminiscent wallpaper covers half the room and framed sketches of fish plaster the other half.\nService was the only redeeming quality. \nTo put it in perspective, my neighborhood Houlihans seems gourmet next to this place."
0,"We were staying at the Westin and it was late and the Original Fish Market was right on site. Well the experience at both the hotel and the restaurant was dismal. We waited too long to be seated and the hosted seemed to have attitude when we asked one of the servers to find her. A simple \""Sorry for the wait\"" would have been nice. We were about to leave after waiting 15 mins for a waiter. Unfortunately we did not.  The food was all bland and tasteless. Oh! Except for the bold taste of Obay on the fries. I had blackened rainbow trout.  I expected a bold favors but yet nothing. It was not even blackened.  Looked like paprika for color, but that was it.  Mash potatoes were dry and tasted gritty like it came from a box. We skipped dessert for obvious reasons. I am not adverse to paying top dollar for a great meal. I hate paying top dollar for a lousy meal that I could have done better myself.\n\nDo yourself a favor and avoid the Original Fish Market.  I was generous to give one star."
0,"Terrible crab bisque. My husband liked the fish stew though.  It had lots of beans, was thick and chili-like. The rest of the lunch was so unnoteworthy, I can't remember what I ordered, though almost all of it was still on the plate at the end of lunch.  I do remember the bad taste in my mouth for the rest of the day."
0,"Literally the worst restaurant experience that I've ever had, including McDonald's and 24-hour scarf-and-barf diners.\n\nPittsburgh is undergoing a bit of a food renaissance, yet the Original Fish Market continues to put out an inferior product in a horrendous atmosphere at an obscene price.  \n\nOur fish was tasteless and rubbery, my white wine came out at room temperature, the restaurant was extremely dirty, and our server was clearly apathetic.  \n\nThe Original Fish Market opened in 1998, and quickly found a place in the market in a city where Red Lobster was still considered \""good seafood\"".  As top-notch restaurants entered the market, the local palates grew up in a big way.  The Original Fish Market seems content to remain frozen in time competing as a mediocre option in an under served market space.  Unfortunately for them, their market space is now flooded with options offering a far superior product  at a fraction of the price."
0,This place really should be much higher quality for first the prices and second the only food option at the Westin.  I stopped by here two nights ago on a work trip to grab some food.  The wine that I ordered was out (which was fine) and substituted - but for a place with a giant wine cellar I wouldn't suspect that should be an issue for the glass wines.\n\nWhen I went to order I asked the server how the scallops were - and asked her to be honest.  She said that they are the most well done in Pittsburgh.  Well I think she meant that literally because the scallops were as tough as a tire and there presentation was poor with a pile of over salty spinach and some kinds of blobs smeared around the plate.  I was a little bummed about my experience when the 55 dollar bill came for one entree and a glass of wine.\n\nAlso a one off thing but the overhead light on the table was like a 10K watt surgical spotlight.  It actually hurt my eyes to look at the table it was so bright.  That should be an easy adjustment for the management.  Food quality on the other hand - you need a new chef.
0,"DIDN'T EAT HERE...this review not about the food.  We went on Friday night around 8pm, there seemed to be about 25% occupancy.  The hostess asked us if we had a reservation, we didn't , and she told us that they were somewhat behind and that we would have to wait 20-30 minutes.  WTF?  We IMMEDIATELY left and frankly its not worth going back again.  shame, the fish was good there. Crappy hostess for sure."
0,Stopped in for lunch. No greeter so we weren't sure where to go. Super expensive for the portions. My salad had dressing only in the center. The rest was dry. My sweet potato fries that came with breaded shrimp tasted BBQ-ish  weird. But the worst was that my breaded shrimp actually had a curly hair cooked into the bread ing. It was disgusting. The waitress apologized and offered to replace but my appetitive was gone by then. She however did not offer to comp the meal. I would absolutely not return nor recommend it to anyone. Way too overpriced and the hair was a disgusting unwanted bonus :-(
0,"Not good. I suspect the servers are over worked or spread too thin b/c the service sucked. The food was ok, but nothing special. It's a shame b/c better service would have made the experience decent."
0,"Never been before and went on a Thursday night at 6PM before a show. Upon arriving, all the good seating near the windows was blocked off for private use (and remained unused). The \""host\"" told us to go find our own seating wherever we wanted. The setup is interesting with a large open bar area and a small number of tables around the perimeter. We took a seat at a table. The bar seating was fairly full with some milling around in the area and standing, and probably a total of 30 people there. We saw at least 5-6 staff, a couple sitting around playing on their phones.\n\nWe sat at our table for 20 minutes and never had a single person come by, not to say we will be there shortly, not to take a drink order, nothing. We could tell this wasn't going to be good so left and no one even noticed.\n\nIt was a little more bar than restaurant, so we weren't sad to leave."
0,"Extremely disappointed.    My wife and I walked into the restaurant to have the hostess tell us that is was open seating.   Okay, that's fine..... as we walk to find our table I'm wondering 'why don't the just have a sign there because she wasn't  very friendly, nor timely with the direction.'    That said, we sat down at a table set up for dining that was nicely presented.   Unfortunately we sat at the table for approximately five minutes without recognition from any employee at the restaurant.   At this point, we decided to dine elsewhere.   As we walked out, there was still not one bit of attention given, again.   The hostess never lifted her head from whatever she was reading.   I think that a sign would have served a much better purpose.   On the back side it could have said \""thanks for your business\"" .....or lack, there of."
0,"The menu was small and underwhelming. The flatbread pizza most likely came out of the box. They didn't have the sauces, so the gave us ketchup to go with over cooked shrimp/bacon and extremely greasy fries."
0,"I ... don't know why I keep going back to Olive or Twist. Seriously, you could check my Foursquare stats and see that I've been to this bar more frequently than any place I've ever called my favorite spot in Pittsburgh. \n\nWhy? I moved up here from Orlando to be with my boyfriend who I had just started dating. I moved because Orlando on a whole sucks and I was ready to get out. My boyfriend used to play in a band as does one of his best friends now. This was their favorite spot to hang out out because all of the (female) bartenders know and love them. They used to get free or greatly reduced drinks, could be as loud and obnoxious as they wanted, etc. etc. - the ush. \n\nI tag along now because I didn't know many people in this city at first, obviously. The bar is way too small for the number of people who try to pack in at night. I've had several items off of the menu and they all left a lot to be desired. The drinks are poured strongly. At first I thought this was because the bartenders knew how the boys liked their drinks, but now I realize they're just heavy handed. \n\nNothing here really sticks out for me. I can get the drinks properly made elsewhere for the price. Same with the food. I guess the only reason I agree to go back time after time is because of two of the bartenders - Amy and Linda. Those two are the most kick ass bartenders in Pittsburgh. Considering I currently live in Heinz, it's also pretty damn close, which works in its favor (can't wait to move ... ). \n\nOlive or Twist has a great location and, if Amy and/or Linda are working, you're sure to enjoy yourself. Just keep those expectations low."
0,"We were in Pittsburgh for one night and Olive or Twist was near our hotel.  There were many other restaurants, but this place looked nice.  The atmosphere was nice, and if I was rating only for atmosphere I'd give it 4 stars.  However, I'm mainly rating their food and service.  We were greeted promptly, but after that the service was spotty and it took awhile to receive our drinks/food even though there weren't many people in the dining room.  \n\nI ordered the Traditional French Dip Sandwich and Fries.  I enjoy a good French Dip and have tried many of them at all types of restaurants and this one was the worst I've ever eaten. In fact, I couldn't finish it.  The meat tasted like old lunch meat and the bread was nothing more than a cheap, glorified hot dog roll that was soggy.  It wasn't soggy from the Au Jus, but it tasted like they steamed the roll for some reason.  \n\nOverall, if I was going back to Pittsburgh in this area, I would stay far away from Olive or Twist."
0,"I've actually had OK experiences at this place in the past but this trip was especially bad. \n\nI tried to stop here with my husband for an appetizer and a drink before heading into the theater district - bad move.  Upon being seated the server explained that they were no longer serving food because of a water leak or something unsanitary-sounding. Klassy. \n\nFor reasons I truly can't explain, we decided to stay for a beer before heading to our destination. We both threw down a brew nasty, paid and left. Unfortunately for Olive or Twist, the visit would probably be our last.\n\nOn a positive note, there was an interesting man setting up for what looked like a live acoustic set. His warm-up sounded good but we left before he really got started. \n\n\nWhen it's all said and done, we should have just went to the Sharp Edge down the street. Probably a much safer bet for future endeavors."
0,Owner or manager was very rude when we presented our yelp deal.
0,"This bar is cramped, overpriced, and the service is unbelievably slow. Happy Hour runs 4-6, so you'll show up at 5, have no place to sit or stand, and will only be able to get *maybe* 2 drinks during happy hours You'll then be told that the upstairs (which is actually not bad) will be opening at 5, even though you're asking at 5:20 (this has seriously happened all three times I've been there).\n\nSeriously, avoid this place. When one of your co-workers suggests a work happy hour, direct them anywhere else."
0,"Very disappointed.  I had been to Olive or Twist for drinks and really enjoyed it but had never been there for a meal.  I was going to a show at the Benedum with a friend and made reservations about a week and a half before the show.  We arrived about 15 minutes early for our 6:00 reservation expecting we may not be able to be seated yet.  The problem is that even though I called and made a reservation (including the person answering the phone taking my name and phone number and repeating the date and time) we were told there was no reservation for our name.  The hostess said something along the lines of \""are you sure you called here to make a reservation and not somewhere else\""  Yes, I'm pretty sure I called the right restaurant...  She kept looking at the room of empty tables, looking at the book and then looking at us.  After a few minutes of back and forth, she told us the lounge upstairs was open and we were welcome to grab a table up there.  So we trudged upstairs.  All that was available were small high top tables.  Being a Friday night, it was packed with the happy hour crowd and was pretty noisy.  Not really the environment we were looking for but we decided to make the most of it.\nWe started with the Buffalo Chicken Dip appetizer.  It is served in a martini glass with toasted/fried pita chips.  It was tasty and we were surprised at how much dip there actually was.  \nThe problems with food began with the pacing of the meal.  We had our appetizer for under five minutes when our entrees came out.  It may not have been a big deal if we were at a real table in the restaurant downstairs, but being at the high top bar tables, we had no room for our drinks, appetizer and meal.  We found ourselves stacking stuff and pulling things off the table in order to fit everything.  It was frustrating.  Not to mention that we would either have to let our entrees get cold as we finished the appetizer or let the appetizer get cold as we ate our entrees.  \nWith as much as we enjoyed the appetizer, we were looking forward to our meals. Unfortunately, they were very disappointing.  My friend ordered the french dip sandwich with a side of mashed potatoes.  Her potatoes were ice cold and sandwich luke warm.  When she mentioned it to the server, the server said \""so would you like me to take them back or are they ok\""  When would cold mashed potatoes ever be OK?  When her potatoes were brought back warmed, she was disappointed because they were called \""garlic mashed\"" but she said they were pretty bland with not much garlic at all.\nI ordered the Caribbean Jerk Chicken.  It was described as \""grilled chicken seasoned with jerk spices, pepper jack cheese, garlic mayo and pineapple chutney on a Kaiser roll\""  No mention of a tomato.  When I got the sandwich, there were three tomatoes on it.   Thankfully I just dislike tomatoes and it wasn't an allergy issue.  There was also no pineapple chutney.  When I asked about it, the server told me they use a sauce and it must have been soaked into the roll.\nOverall, very disappointed.  I wanted to love Olive or Twist because I really enjoyed the time I had visited for a drink, but the dining experience was sorely lacking, especially for a dinner that was supposed to be a nice laid back start to our girl's night out."
0,"At the request of a friend, we had a brief girls night out at Olive or Twist. My first impression was the outdated decor. The restaurant has carpet which I find off putting. The drink menu is extensive; but, with the exception of one person in my party, we each found our drinks far too sweet. I ordered the cucumber basil martini, which was so sweet I had to send it back. The food was mediocre. I ordered the burger medium and it was over cooked to nearly well done. And then there was the cheesy lounge singer who sang a mishmosh of singer songwriter tunes from the 80s. The music was so loud and so bad that my friends I left and headed down the street to Butcher and the Rye."
0,"I stopped in last night for a drink with a group of friends... we were in town visiting and I had been wanting to try this place out since we walked past it on the last trip... what a disappointment.  The server was prompt to greet us and drop off drink menus, but then she failed to return to take our order for at least 20 minutes.  It would've been different if she had been slammed, but the entire time she was standing by the bar, just talking to her coworkers.  By the time she came to take our order we were ready to leave... and we should have... the martinis were not good and the server's disposition left much to be desired.  When we were ready to leave she made us feel like it was a bother to split our tabs between the five of us.  The one positive of the place was that I liked the ambiance, but it wasn't enough to make up for everything else being lackluster.  What I was hoping to be a great ending to the night turned into a dismal experience that put everyone in a bad mood."
0,"Completely agree with Deborah: decent sandwich on absolutely horrible bread - mealy tomato and brown lettuce, too.  I know it was only $4/$7 for a 6\""/12\"" sub, but it was pretty bad.  (I bought a 12\"", intending to take half home for later, but I wound up throwing the second half away, and I NEVER throw away food.)  \n\nAs a Italian grocery, it seems okay, but the attitudes are a little snippy, and it's a pretty grungy-looking place."
0,"The italian coldcut sub was a travesty! Lots of STALE bread with skimpy meat portions, and no hots or flavor. Bread better suited for pigeons than people. I can find better Italian sandwiches back home in Baltimore. We'll feed these to our dogs when we get home.  You get what you pay for. Avoid this tourist trap!"
0,"First time in Pittsburgh, from Chicago. \n\n1. NO ONE SEEMS TO KNOW HOW THE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM WORKS.\n2. What is with the silly system of paying on your way out sometimes? It seems like the dumbest idea ever.\n3. Where are the reloadable transit cards?\n4. Why are the conductors so incredibly angry?\n5. Why do I need to request a stop on the \""T\""?\n\nOf the public transportation systems I've used, this is definitely the most confusing so far. Even if the website had an easier to understand fare explanation.\n\nLearn from the CTA. I have a new appreciation for Chicago Transit Authority."
0,"Last night marked the second time in a week that I waited 30 minutes or more for a 71B in the freezing cold rain.   I was 5 minutes early for the bus I was trying to catch.  I can understand a delay during rush hour, but this was not.  The bus was running every 20 minutes both times, according to the PAT schedule. When I gave up last night and went into my apartment, it was an additional 10 minutes before the bus went by...So let's review: I waited a total of 45 minutes for a bus that was supposed to be coming past every 20 minutes.  For shame!\n\nFrom now on, I'll be hoofing it across the East End instead of buying a bus pass.  It will be cold, but at least I'll be moving."
0,"Don't ever get too comfortable with PAT--- they end up swiping everything out from under your feet, and then charging you a crapload for it.  I can't believe they're slashing more routes, and charging more!  Why would I pay you for continual service downgrades?!!?  You're not even offering a bus to the airport anymore here soon--- Do you know how many people ride that bus to WORK at/around the airport.  I tell you what.... Whoever runs your company is A DUMBASS to the 10th degree.\n\nGet your shit together.  Seriously.  Id rather walk from my work downtown, to my home in Oakland (thats an hour walk, and MORE than a mile) while Im 8 months pregnant,  than pay you assholes to take me home. \n\n\nP.S. I didnt even want to give it ONE star."
0,"I don't understand why Pittsburghers routinely put up with the idiocy that is our public transportation system.  Port Authority of Allegheny County is public transportation with massive, severe, permanent brain damage.  Unreliable, buses routinely don't come at all during heavy commuting times (like when you're trying to get to work on time), many of the drivers are assholes, the fare doubled in a decade and the service was cut in half.  The county refuses to fund it.  Getting on and off is confusing.  When to pay is confusing.  The schedules are hard to read.  The service isn't frequent enough.  The subway system only goes to one neighborhood from downtown.  This is horrible and it's one of the main things keeping Pittsburgh from being as great a city as it can be.  Call center people are sometimes rude and mostly unresponsive.  What else?  The buses smell like urine.  Sucks, sucks, sucks.  I live 3 miles from downtown and I commute by walking every day, to and from, because Port Authority of Allegheny County buses suck that bad."
0,"Port Authority of Allegheny County employs some very, very bad drivers.\n\nA driver deliberately cut me off a few minutes ago on Liberty Avenue downtown. Further, the driver did not express that he was sorry for cutting me off and forcing me to swerve into oncoming traffic. \n\nThe driver is a middle-aged man. He was driving the G2 bus. The bus number is 5525. \n\nI will call the Port Authority in a few minutes to lodge my complaint; however, I wanted to lodge it here too for two reasons. First, the complaint bears on the Port Authority's ability to keep its riders safe (because the driver almost caused an accident, which could have resulted in injuries to the riders of the bus). Second, if this driver causes an accident in the future, I hope this complaint will help injured parties make a case for negligent retention or negligent supervision against the Port Authority."
0,"First off:  I'm a picky eater, so take this with a grain of salt.\n\nOkay, I'm not from pittsburgh.  I am not overweight, not a hipster, not on any of the plethora of drugs, I own my own home,  Probably most of all, I've never heard anything about this place before walking in, so I had no idea what to expect besides \""Lets get breakfast.\""\n\nIf you are the opposite of any of these points, this place is probably worth a try for you.\n\nWe had a horrendous wait, but I think that was a complete fluke:  we had a huge group and there was an event that weekend...I don't think anyone with less than 3-4 had that long of a wait at all.\n\nThe waitresses are ornery, but not rude...just clear.  They aren't going to make nice or kiss your rear, they're not there for that.  I found this respectable, and liked it.\n\nBut the food?  Oh God.\n\nPros:  Portions are massive, all the other reviews will tell you that.\n            1) Prices are reasonable, cheap even, but I suppose that has something to do with the fact that the first pound or two of your meal is pure potato.  Seriously...I think I had at *least* three idaho russets in chipped form on my plate alone.\n            2) ....uhm.  ....  Nothing was dry?\n\nCons:  There was no color anywhere.  Absolutely everything on every plate I saw in the place was some blend of beige.  Potatoes, egg white, pancake, sausage...after you tilted the whatever-grease-that-was out of your dish, everything was the same color.  \n             Half my dish was potato.  \n             The egg was not over-medium, it was still-runny, even the whites.  I presume this was because they were slammed, and didn't have time to cook what were almost certainly factory-chicken eggs.\n             The sausage was not identifiably sausage.\n             I had my entire day's required calories in butter alone on the toast.\n             There was seriously nothing remotely healthy on this menu.  Nothing raw, nothing green, nothing fresh, not even as an ingredient. Even McDonalds has a fruit cup, ffs!  TACO BELL has better quality food!\n             \n\nTake one look at the clientele when you walk in.  It attracts exactly the kind of people you would picture in a dingy greasy-spoon truck-stop.  If you are not one of those people, Do Not Bother, this place makes Denny's look classy."
0,"Clearly based on other reviews, I should try this during daylight hours. \n\nWe went after a long night out, landing there around 2:30. I've been to plenty of late night places, after-hour bars, etc, but I've never been as scared as I was at Jo-jo's. \n\n2 fights broke out while we were there. First a group of guys, then their girlfriends. Then a guy at the next table threw up on the ground -some splashing on my leg. \n\nThen we heard police sirens and the fights were escalating - so we bolted. Maybe this is a rare experience? Anyway - I won't be heading back anytime soon!"
0,"This was the worst service I have ever gotten, the employee at the airport avis center stole money from us. We were trying to rent a car in the airport and we thought the price was too expensive, so we asked her not to swipe the card while we confirmed that we wanted this price while we leave she swipes our card. And what happened we are 3500$ short. \n\nAlso the prices are really bad here, for one car the price with insurance was 3500$ while at enterprise is 1700$. \n\nWe still haven't gotten our money back and now we have no money in the middle of nowhere Pennsylvania. Avis customer service says we have to wait 72 hours. Thanks for starving us avis and making us sleep in our cars. \n\nNever go here."
0,"i find i can no longer be a customer at salon christine. christine's conduct/attitude toward me regarding my valid question about aveda products possibly reverting back to animal testing was rude, unprofessional, and insulting. not only did she not respond to my facebook question on her salon's page, but only after an email to her, did she reply with a curt answer, and to add insult to injury, she's banned me from further posting/commenting on the salon's facebook page. i didn't realize an inquiry regarding a product for which i'm paying wasn't permitted. instead of setting the record straight (which should've been done), she elected to ignore my question, delete it from facebook, and then ban me from the salon's page. wow. that said, i'll really miss katie, as she's a great hairstylist and colorist."
0,"I purchased a gift certificate up front from them only to find out that they were never going to let me use it.    I kept calling to try to make appointments and each time I called, the staff was rude and said that they had no appointments.    My gift certificate expired because they never had any appointments available (or so they said) and when I explained my situation to them over the phone, they were extremely rude.    I said that I would tell my friends and family about my awful experience there and about how they took my money but never provided services to me.    The staff said something extremely rude to me over the phone and then hung up.\n\nI will never give this salon my money again.     It's a shame that I'm out 50 bucks and have nothing to show for it.     I was scammed."
0,"The food was just OK. Soggy french fries on a greasy cheese steak pattie.  The service was awful, noise, and not helpful for a newcomer to Primantis and Pittsburgh."
0,"We ate at Primanti Bros based on the reviews on Yelp, hoping to get a real taste of Pittsburgh. What I ordered was a sandwich labeled Pittsburgher Cheese Steak. What I got was an inedible slab of overcooked mystery meat, cole slaw, and mediocre fries, on white bread. The sandwich was very small, but I only ate 1/2 of it anyway, and I have a pretty big appetite. I recently ate a 20 oz cheeseburger at a local burger joint.\n\nI was truly shocked. That was the worst meat that I have seen since Junior High School. We would have been much better off at Burger King. Luckily we had a nice lunch at Salim's to wash the taste of this junk of our mouths."
0,Worst sandwich on Earth.\nI'd rather eat a dead whore.\nPlease...never come here.
0,"GROSS!!! Many people told me to go here and I was totally disappointed! It was bland, the coleslaw was too tangy (and only contained cabbage) and the meat was scary! Good thing it's super cheap. Do NOT get the cheese-steak sandwich if you go even though it says #2 best seller, it's awful! \n\nOkay on to service... Everyone seemed like they hated their job. Someone at my table asked for no tomatoes and add onions and of course she got tomatoes and no onions.\n\nMaybe I ordered the wrong thing and maybe they were all just having a bad day... Who knows."
0,"Everyone knows that that if you go to Pittsburgh, you go to Primanti Bros. (My friends and I were in town for a Pirates/Phillies game, and the PNC Park Primanti Bros was packed the entire game.) We visited the Market Square location, and if you eat on the patio, it's a fun place to hang out and drink some Iron City beers. \n\n I got the Black Angus Sandwich. It was quite large, cut in half, and brought on a piece of wax paper. As it turned out, I'm pretty sure the wax paper would have tasted better. It was really, really, not good. I did eat the first half, but the bread was so tasteless, I thought maybe it would be better if I ate the other half piece by piece. The coleslaw was OK, but the french fries were awful, and the little bit of actual meat had little taste. We had little to no contact with employees, but a cab driver told us about a young couple who dared to ask for a sandwich at another Primanti Bros without coleslaw, and were treated really rudely. Because you know, people being rude is hilarious. \n\nSo I guess if you want an authentic Pittsburgh experience then go here. But if you want actual decent food, avoid at all costs"
0,After sitting there and being ignored for 25 minutes we just left!
0,"Clearly should have read a few reviews before going here. Whenever I go to these types of iconic regional dining establishments, I order the house specialty to best judge the place on its supposed merits. Since it was 11 in the morning, I chose not to order Primanti's #1 best seller, which the waitress told me was beer, but perhaps that would have made my experience better. As it was, I ordered the #2 best seller, the cheese steak. It was heinous. \n\nThink a grimy, mechanically separated Salisbury-style steak with a meager slice of provolone on sliced Italian bread served signature Primanti-style: with coleslaw, tomatoes, and fries.\n\nFirst, the steak was disgusting: terrible flavor (smelled and tasted like hippie armpit, which I'm not necessarily opposed to as long as it's not involved in something I'm trying to eat) with a gross, processed meat texture. Secondly, the fries easily overwhelmed the sandwich, with their old fryer grease taste. Additionally, the sandwich was unwieldy and threatening to fall apart at every turn--a trait I don't hold against decent-tasting sandwiches, but this lack of structural integrity just added insult to injury. \n\nMy dining partners were equally disgusted by their choices: corned beef and ham & cheese sandwiches, respectively. Easily the best part of the meal was the Smallman Street Fries, and those were equally lack-luster. The \""bacon\"" was simply bacon bits (oh, the humanity!), the chili was uninspired, and the cheese sauce and sour cream did little but soggy the fries. (Did I mention they tasted like old fryer grease?)  \n\nI will never go back and I will immediately disregard the culinary opinions of anyone who thinks Primanti Bros. produces decent food."
0,"Wildly overrated.  I compare it to Pat's and Geno's in Philly, good when your drunk, but only when your drunk.\n\nI went to Pitt for 4 years and I have to say I never understood the Primantis hype.  I dont know how you get famous for putting fries on a sandwich when the fries suck.  They are soggy and tasteless, maybe the worst I've ever had.  I will say the coleslaw is pretty good, and I'm not usually a coleslaw guy, but it doesnt make up for all the other shortcomings.  \n\nHalf the sandwich falls out while your eating.  The \""cheesesteak\"" might be the most tasteless sandwich ever.  You have to use a whole bottle of hot sauce just to get a little flavor.  \n\nPrimantis sucks...go to Fatheads on the Southside or Uncle Sam's in Oakland."
0,"I realize it's a sandwich shop and I dared to order a salad - but their menu is limited - so why put something on it if you're not going to do it right? Ordered a grilled chicken salad, take out. Got back to the hotel and found it had a pile of tasteless, cold french fries on it...so cold they never melted the shredded orange cheese-food underneath them. Also no salt or ketchup was included, so even if I DID want to eat stone cold, unseasoned fries, they would suck. The balsamic dressing I ordered was replaced by (fake) raspberry vinaigrette, so repulsive it required a trip all the way back  to the restaurant to get the correct dressing, which they were out of. Would have been nice to have been asked, since they did have Italian on hand - seems like a closer match. The iceberg lettuce, olive, and tomato salad, oh yeah, it did have a bit of chicken on it too, was okay once I scraped all that orange congealed \""cheese\"" off.  That and all the smokers hanging around the place (and Pittsburgh in general), I would say this place is a totally over-rated dump."

After waiting more than 20 minutes for our sandwiches (in the end these are still just sandwiches), they came out cold - and I'm not just talking about the meat, lettuce, tomatoes - everything was cold including the fries.  What a disappointment.  Head to DiBellas - much better service, subs and sandwiches."
0,"Well, it finally happened: I had to give a place a single star. And it kills me that the place I gave it to had to be Primanti's. I'm an awful Pittsburgher.\n\nI don't give low ratings easily or often, so believe me: this place pushed all of my buttons to earn this awful review. In fact, the single star was only earned because the place is cleaner and more comfy than some of the other Primanti places I've been too. It kind of has an old diner feeling to it and I liked that. \n\nAlas, that's all I liked.\n\nSo, why such a low score? Well:\n\nThe service was terrible. After spending twenty minutes sitting without anyone coming to refill my water or ask for my actual order - note, the place was almost completely empty - I went to the register to ask for something to eat, which I'd started to think I had to do after watching a couple people do the same (in hindsight, I probably misinterpreted their actions, but my mistake does not excuse what happened next). My waiter looked at me and went, \""Don't you get the concept of a restaurant? Haven't you been to any restaurants, like, ever? Sit back down and I'll take your order.\"" \n\nAnd not even in a joking manner that made me feel like I could smile about my mistake - this guy was being a condescending, rude, arrogant person. It was unbelievable. Utterly, totally unbelievable. If I hadn't met company there that night, I would have walked out right then.\n\nTo make matters worse, this was not a good night to order anything at Primanti's. The coleslaw was way too sweet and there was far too much of it, the fries were bland and had no texture at all, and there was barely any meat on my sandwich at all. The result? A big pile of carbs that really didn't taste great after the first few bites, rather than a delicious sandwich.\n\nBefore you all kill me, please note: I LIKED my meal at Mt. Lebanon's Primanti location. They also have a more diverse menu, which is always a bonus for me - I like having more options. I think in the future, I will stick to that location in this local chain, where even on a busy night I managed to get food in a decent amount of time. I certainly will not be coming to the downtown location if I spot my previous, downright awful waiter working there again."
0,"I can't for the life of me figure out why all the hype. I was warned by others that this is mainly where tourists eat. But I'm a tourist here, and wanted to try it.\n\nIt was a sandwich mostly of slaw and fries.  \n\nThe thick white bread was dry and boring; too crusty. \n\nThe fries on the sandwich overpowered the taste! So I dismantled it. When the rude server asked how I liked it, I was honest. He gave me big time attitude and commented that I took it apart. I told him, I took it apart because it was a horrible sandwich (the pastrami, by the way). And that, sir, is why you got a $0.35 tip! (never give a zero tip, they'll think you forgot, always leave just a small amount of change)\n\nIf you have to put all that hot sauce on the sandwich to make it palatable, why bother?  (The server, as he walked away, told me it's really good with hot sauce, which was just Tabasco, which I don't like, any way!)\n\nThey left off the tomato that supposedly comes with each sandwich!\n\nOf the 4 staff members I came in contact with, all but 1 were rude, unfriendly and uncaring. One constantly walked by trash that had blown off outdoor tables without picking it up.\n\nThe fries were good. \n\nNope, won't be back."
0,"I've heard all the hype and wanted to try it.  Tonight was my second attempt here.   First time, new girl on the grill apologized to me at 10 minutes, at 15 I walked.  Not even an acknowledgement from the wait staff.   Tonight, the waiter seemed mad that I didn't know what I wanted to order.  After I explained that I'd never been there, he brought me a menu and then proceeded to ignore me for 10 minutes.  I walked again.  No more tries here.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong?  Haha."
0,"Had lunch here while visiting friends in the area .... After seeing all the hype about this place on various tv food shows I was very excited to eat hear . WOW ,,, what a dissapointment , This place is so over hyped it isnt funny . To compare this place to the famous sandwich places is NYC is a joke . The sandwiches may be big , but only because they are over stuffed with fries and cole slaw . To steal a line from a old TV commercial .... WERE'S THE BEEF .....  A major major dissapointment ."
0,"I was really looking forward to a huge tasty sandwich but was greatly disappointed! Everything was bland, nothing had seasoning, not even basic salt. Soggy fries, tasteless meat, average coleslaw on white bread trying to double for Italian bread. Save your time, money and calories and go to Wendy's instead."
0,"Super slow service. They have inside and outside seating which is nice. However, they only have two waitresses outside for about 20 tables. They don't take your entire order they only take your drink order and then your good order. It took 10 minutes to get our drink order. After finally getting our drinks she waited another ten minutes to come get our food. When we ordered our food when I asked for light coleslaw she said they can't do that and for me to just take it off. She explained that they just put fistfuls on it. So why can't they just put less fistfuls on it? \n\n\nOur waitress was very rude and didn't make me feel welcomed at all. She never introduced herself and just treated us like animals. \n\nI would never tell anybody to go to the Primanti Brothers again downtown. The one in Oakland is so much nicer and better quality. \n\nIt's really bad management to have only two people serving outside when there are over 20 tables. It's not fair for the customers or for the servers. \n\nWhile the food was good as always it wasn't worth the wait because it just took to long. The service wasn't nice at all and I wouldn't tell anybody to come here when it's crowded."
0,"I had lived outside of Pittsburgh for a couple of years and have eaten at this Primanti Brothers location four or five times. Their sandwiches were always tasty, worth the wait and the trouble of finding parking etc. So, when my parents came to visit, and we made a trip out that-a-way, I knew that would be a lunch stop. We ended up coming into Pittsburgh on Sunday around 1pm. I knew it would be crowded and anticipated having a wait. We got a table after 15 to 20 minutes and quickly sat down before someone else did. It took the waitress about 10 minutes to come and clear the previous customers remnants, which was ok. \n\nWe ordered our beers and were told that she'd come back and take our order. She came back 20 minutes later, with the beers and took our order. After that, we sat around and waited for our sandwiches for 35 minutes. When we did finally get our food, it was ice cold. The fries in the sandwich were completely soggy and cold, and the meat was barely warm. Our table ran out of napkins, and we asked for some, but they never came, finally, the table next to ours handed us a few. Maybe it was because it was cold, but the sandwiches weren't that great. I had very little meat in mine, and more coleslaw that anything else. Also, the thickness of the bread seems to have increased since I last ate here because about 60% of my sandwich was bread. We were fairly disgruntled about the whole thing, but were still going to leave a tip for the waitress. \n\nThen, my dad went to the bar to pay. He stood there for 10 minutes, behind another customer. The server came up to them and said 'what the hell are you doing up here?', in those words!! My dad was so stunned be just stood there, the guy in line ahead of him told her that he was waiting to pay his bill, so she cashed him out and then turned around to do something else, when my dad said 'excuse me, i need to pay too', she replied to him ' Jeez, you guys are so demanding! Why the hell are you in such a hurry\"". That is when their tip went straight out the door with us. \n\nWe were ok waiting for a table, we were even ok waiting for our food; it took them one hour from the time we sat down, to the time we got our food, and then the server had the audacity to behave in that manner. Either Primanti Brothers has become too big for their boots and let things slide, or they need to train their staff to be more polite and efficient. We will definitely not be coming back the next time we are in town. Our money is better spent else where."
0,Worst service ever.  The waitress and I use that term loosely rolled her eyes at any question when ordering and yelled at someone at the table for asking for coleslaw on the side.  Then she had to come back and re ask the orders again and got mad when we repeated about the coleslaw since she didn't repeat it back.  When she brought out the food she just slammed the food down and just shouted out the name of one of the sandwiches um are you asking who had which sandwich which is your job to remember anyways.  I'm glad I don't live in Pittsburgh to have to worry about avoiding this place.
0,"Can I give this place ZERO stars? They're supposively \""famous\"" for their sandwiches so some friends and I go when we are in town. The waitresses all rolled their eyes and glared at me for not wanting my fries on top of my sandwich. (Not to mention the waitress was in the skimpiest tank top with her bra hanging out while waiting on us and grilling food. Gross.) I get that your famous for having fries on the sandwich but regardless, a customer should be able to get what they want. This place was trashy, dirty and probably not even up to code."
0,"This is the most overrated place bragged about in Pittsburgh. My first visit was to the one in South Hills. Waited 90 mins for 4 sandwiches. The coleslaw is gross and I'm a fan of coleslaw. Due to the 90 min wait I was given a gift card which I used at the one in Market Square. This time I got the grilled chicken salad. If you like chewing on rubber bands, I recommend it. It was the absolute worst salad I've ever had, how can you screw up a salad? The chicken was tasteless and rubbery. Got it to go and the girl who took the order over the phone was rude and rushed and was equally rude when I picked it up. She assumed she knew my name and my order and handed me a random bag of food. I told her I was missing a sandwich and she tossed another bag at me without saying a word. I will NEVER go back to any of these locations. I'd rather eat a ham sandwich from Sheetz. At least I can get that without an attitude. If you have friends coming to visit from out of town, take them anywhere but here. And for those who say you have to go to the original one in the Strip, no thanks, it's the same food. If you are looking for an awesome sandwich go to Schmitz Old World Deli in Greenfield."
0,"Service was bad. Server walked away before we were done ordering and then when someone got her attention she had to return 5 minutes later to re clarify which it was wrong. We didn't see her for a good 20 minutes and had to go up to the bar for refills. She did take one of our cups to refill it, sat it on the bar and left it there for 10 minutes, when we finally saw her again had to ask her to grab it off the bar. Highly disappointing Philly cheesesteak!! The meat in it is that of a frozen Salisbury steak TV dinner!! French fries were good."
0,"First Yelp review ever. Not impressed at all! 45% bread, 25% cole slaw, 25% fries, and 5% meat. The bread is cold and not grilled or warmed on the grill. Avoid and eat else where. Don't even think about the wings (dry and no flavor)."
0,"Being from LA, I was disappointed with the tacos. The Carne Asada was bland and didn't think this is authentic Mexican food but another street faire."
0,"This review is for the taco stand in front of Reyna's, which is run by the same owner as Reyna's and Casa Reyna. Note that this is *not* the same stand as the one around the corner on 21st Street, across the alley from Pamela's.\n\nI got an order of three tacos from them on a cold day a couple weekends ago. The meat was cold before I could start eating it, and I assumed it had just cooled off quickly. \n\nWithin a few hours everything I had eaten was leaving me in a hurry. I felt sick and weak for the rest of the day, and was better (and completely empty) the next morning.\n\nNever going back, of course. This doesn't directly reflect on Casa Reyna's inside restaurant, but since the same people run it, it makes me worry about their food handling standards.\n\nI'll probably keep getting Reyna's big bag of chips when I need them for a party, but I'm never eating any other prepared food from them again."
0,OMG what a nightmare. I was there last saturday at 9pm with a group of 10 people in the second floor bar area. The bartenders acted like it was a big inconvience that we were there. ordered drinks and didnt even get a thank you. the bar was dirty and littered with dirty glasses. The restrooms were filthy and didnt even have toliet paper . We left the bar and spent a HUGE anoun of money up the street.. I will never go back.
0,Another place that I visit once every few years thinking it couldn't be as bad as I remember it.  And the place NEVER lets me down; it's just as bad as I remember.  The seafood is breaded and fried to the point of inedible.  The staff is rude.  The prices are too high for the quality.  Just all around disappointing.
0,"I hesitate to even write this review because technically we didn't eat here.  But after reading the other reviews, I thought \""Eh, what the hell.\""\n\nWe came in and were seated at 5:45pm for desserts/drinks.   By 6:05, we still hadn't seen our waitress.  We decided it wasn't worth it and just left.\n\nI did eat here a month ago, and yes -- the fried fish was fried to the point where it was beyond greasy.  And then to pay around $20 for that?  LOL.  Right.\n\nI won't be back."
0,"Went to this place for lunch last Saturday, party of five. The service was extremely slow and every beer we tried to order, got the response \""We are out of that one\"". \n\nFinally when we got our sandwiches (after a long wait) but no coleslaw and fries were soggy and stale. When asked the waitress for coleslaw (which is supposed to be the side with every sandwich), the response was \""I think we are out, but let me check\"". And the waitress didn't return until after we were done eating. \nForget about getting a refill for your drink or water.."
0,"NEVER AGAIN!!!! Horrible service and horrible food! It took 20 minutes for our waitress to even come to our table! Looking back on it, I don't know why we didn't leave... maybe because we had to wait 20 minutes to even get a table (this was during the summer). We ordered the muscles to start off which were okay but definitely not something I would recommend. My husband ordered the fish and chips and I ordered the crab cakes.... EPIC FAIL!!! The crab cakes were so disgusting my husband and I had to switch meals. The crab cakes taste like fried mayo... I couldn't even taste the crab! The fish and chips looked great but it didn't taste like anything! No seasoning at all! The waitress was so bad that when it came time to give us our check, she was no where to be found. It took 15 minutes to actually get the check (keep in mind we already finished eating)... thank God we had cash! A complete waste of $40. Yes, I remember exactly how much I spent even though it was months ago because I kept thinking how I could have spent that money in a better place! I could have got a mani & pedi... had some great sushi... the list goes on. lol"
0,"We had a frustrating and disappointing experience at Roland's, a dining out experience on a recent 4-day visit to Pittsburgh.\n\nFirst, all of the food was extremely overpriced. The quality was what you would find if you were ordering from a bar...but it was twice as expensive. The $16 I paid for fried cod got me two soggy cod filets, steamed bland vegetables and boring roasted potatoes. I couldn't have tried to make food this poor. It was a Sysco food operation gone wrong: runoff from Houlihan's mixed with Joe's Crab Shack. \n\nThe service was so slow that we were cancelling orders due to the delay in bringing them to the table. My dish arrived without any sort of sauce, and we even had to get up and order beer from the bar because our waitress was so behind. It was her \""second day on the job,\"" but this is unacceptable. They could have at least comp'd our beers, or offered some other way to make it up (besides coming over to informing us that they had charged the beers to our bill).\n\nRoland's had space available on a Monday night, unlike the other restaurants in the neighborhood. This was really convenient initially, but I now have an idea of why this was the case."
0,"I would give this restaurant 0 stars if I could.  The food was lousy, the drinks were expensive, and the service was awful.\n\nI complained to the manager about my experience and he told that if I didn't like it, there were plenty of other bars in The Strip District.\n\nPlease, please, please go somewhere else."
0,"Yuck!\n\nIt's almost embarrassing having this place exist in the Strip with so many tourists coming here.  That has to be how they're making their money because it's certainly not on their food or service.  Well, maybe it's the booze too...\n\nI don't even know where to begin.  Service was horrible.  The lunch took 2 hours.  On a leisurely Sunday that may be fine, but there was no leisure.  At least not with drinks not in hand until a 1/2 an hour after we sat down.  I'd say lunch was served another 1/2 to 45 minutes later.  \n\nIt didn't matter though, I knew it wasn't going to be anything spectacular.  I'd heard rumors about the food.  I won't go into any details but I wouldn't trust some items on the menu.  I just played it safe and ordered a veggie salad.  \n\nThe salad was in the entree section, so I assumed it would be a full size salad.  It was not.  It was a side salad with a handful of grilled veggies on top.  Nothing spectacular.  And a side salad at almost $11.  Not worth it.  \n\nIf you are forced to stop in because you're dying of hunger, stick to a liquid diet:)"
0,"Just awful. \n\nMy companions each ordered an Alfredo pasta and they both honestly thought (through the entire meal) that Roland's had served mashed potatoes on the pasta.\n\nWe thought \""maybe it's a 'burgh thing.\""\n\nNope, we were informed at the end of the meal by the waiter that it was indeed Alfredo sauce and that the chef \""just liked to use a lot of parmesan cheese in his Alfredo.\"" This stuff was about the consistently of cold oatmeal with oil poured over it (no exaggeration) and there was a bucket full of it on each plate.\n\nAnybody who would serve what was on those plates has no business whatsoever in any kitchen. \n\nBy the way, my lobster roll was a buttery, greasy fail as well.\n\nWhat a complete disaster."
0,"this place reeks of fish when you walk in and there are fruit flies everywhere.  Good place to dine if you're on a diet since you will surely lose your appetite.\n\nIf you find yourself at Rolands, do yourself a favor and leave and dine anywhere else in the Strip District.  Seriously."
0,"My fiance and I went to Roland's for a \""date night\"".  We were both craving seafood, and had never been here before.  When we arrived, we asked our waitress if there was a happy hour going on.  There was a happy hour and she gave us the menu for it and said she'd be back in a minute to take our order.  The happy hour ended 2 minutes after she gave us the menus, and she came back over 10 minutes later to take our drink order.  Needless to say, we were unable to take advantage of any specials.  We both ordered margaritas for our drinks.  They took a further 15 minutes to come out.  Not only were the drinks weak (and this is coming from a bartender), but one margarita was a substantially different color than the other (despite being the same type).  Additionally, we were charged over $7 apiece for those margaritas that were made with well liquor.  If I'm spending $7 on a margarita, it had either better be tasty or strong (or both).  Anyway, we sip our disappointing drinks and decide to order an appetizer.  We got the Raspberry-maple scallops.  There were cooked well, but served in a watery sauce that removed almost all of the raspberry-maple flavor..  Then we ordered dinner.  We both ordered their broiled seafood medley, which comes with a salad.  I had the caesar salad, although I used the word \""salad\"" in the loosest sense possible.  There was lettuce there, but only after I uncovered it from a cup of croutons and a cup of parmesan cheese (not the fresh kind).  I spent about 5 minutes just trying to reach the lettuce in my salad under all that other stuff, and even when I finished I still had more cheese than lettuce.  While we were eating our salads our entrees were brought out, and we had the luxury of watching them grow cold while we finished our salads.  I'm sorry, but when I'm spending $30 on a entree I would like it served hot and after my salad.  Additionally, we were not provided a change of silverware at any point during our meal and I kept having to \""clean\"" my fork and knife on a spare napkin.  During our meal I ordered a second drink (beer this time, since liquor is apparently too difficult for them) and had to wait another 10 or so minutes before it was brought out.  I had also run out of water and had to wait 15 minutes before it was even noticed, let alone waiting for a refill.  While there were aspects of this evening that were frustrating, I must say that all of my seafood was cooked perfectly (I just wish I had been able to enjoy my entree while it was hot).  When we had eaten our fill and asked for the to-go boxes, the waitress asked to bring our check.  We still wanted another round of drinks and possibly dessert, but she never asked for either.  Despite the feeling that we were being rushed and she wanted to hurry us along, I decided to order another drink.  In my opinion, it is good manners to make customers feel welcome, relaxed, and not rushed.  We did not feel any of these things.  This was supposed to be our date night and there were just so many little annoyances along the way.  Once again, the food was really well cooked, and if I could have left my tip for the kitchen staff instead of the waitress I would have.  They certainly earned it, and she didn't really seem to care.  Also, while our wait times could be expected during a lunch/dinner rush, there were maybe 7 people in the whole restaurant.  It's not like they were busy.  Our waitress was just too preoccupied with chatting with the other servers (in clear view of our table).\n\nIn short, I do not believe we will be dining here again.  We can get the same quality of food for cheaper and with much better service."
0,"If I had to chose between dining at Roland's again, or having to catch running chainsaws that were tossed at me I'd pick dining at Rolands but only by the slimmest of margins.\n\nWhy on earth did I go back to this restaurant?  Clearly, I must not love myself or something.\n\nWant to pay too much money for fish that smells like a sewer?  Dine at Roland's.  The only reason to be at Rolands is to drink there.  they have a pretty decent beer selection."
0,"Roland's was recommended by hotel. Service was terrible. Food was cold. Brick oven pizza cold.... Asked to have it reheated , still came back cold. Steak was way over cooked. Never got appetizer we ordered, but was charged for it.  Was not busy but waitress was hard  to find. Would not go back and would not recommend this place to anyone."
0,"Friends warned me not to eat here. Turns out they were GOOD friends. This was just awful, start to finish. Slow (pitiful) service, nasty food ( and we each sprung for the lobster roll -- if you can call it that!) and a generally miserable experience. And this was an early lunch with very few customers around. The only thing remotely redeemable was that we sat on the balcony overlooking Penn avenue and were entertained by the people below. People watching can be a blast. \n\nI wanted a draft beer and was told that \""we don't serve draft beer upstairs\"". What??? There's a bar there!! Are you kidding me?? So water it was and that took a long time to arrive. And without straws - another wait after I had the audacity to ask for them.  The \""lobster rolls\"" arrived and looked mighty meager. That's not a lobster roll!! But I pressed on. As I got it closer to my mouth there was a slight aroma. But press on. The \""lobster\"" was sparse, tough, and flavorless. How often could you say that about lobster??? Exactly!! It must have been harvested years ago and waited for me to show up so it could make its way out of the freezer. At $15 each this falls clearly into the ripoff category.  And trying to get our check? Ridiculous. \n\nI won't be back. Ever."
0,"Service was great, however, the food was mediocre.  Hostess needs to be more educated about the menu, she was unable to give details on menu items.\nLets start the with fries that seem to be mandatory with each entree.  They had to be cooked prior to us ordering, or even getting there.  They were cold, limp (pause) and over salted.  The burger was just eh.  Grilled onions seemed to be just warmed on the grill, and the beef patty could have used a bit more flavor.  Fat has the flavor people!\n\nOh, the floor at our first table was filthy.  Then the table at the second table was filthy.  What's up with that?\n\nOverall, this joint was not that great."
0,We wanted to eat there today. Waited for about 10 minutes at the entrance. No hostess coming up. Then she shows up saying that she will be back in another second. After additional 5 minutes we ask her what's going on. She did not apologize and says that it will take another 30 minutes. Really??!! Not the nice way to treat a party of 4 wanting to spend some money.
0,"Last weekend my mother and I headed down to the strip to get some weekly goods - lunch meat and cheese from Penn Mac - veggies at Stans - needed some new spices from Penzeys for a chili I was going to make that day....we were both a little hungry and knew we wanted to have a snack before shopping.\n\nWe parked in front of Roland's and see the sign: Famous for Lobster Rolls and Bloody Mary's!\n\nPerfect. \n\nMy mother got the Lobster Roll, which she said was 'good'. The bread, from Mancini's, was of course tasty - toasted and buttery - delicious mostly because it was Mancini's bread. I had the Lobster Roll minus the carbs on a salad - and the lobster was tasty, no doubt , I mean, lobster is just - good. For the price though, not sure that I got enough bang for my buck. The salad was something I could have picked up at Get-Go in the pre-made section. I just didn't feel satisfied at the end of my meal. I couldn't even drink my Bloody Mary (this is a rare affair), way too much horseradish, and I often like horseradish in my Bloodies!\n\nAnd it was cold - didn't even take my winter coat off. So, needless to say, not the best experience.\n\nTalk about false advertisement..."
0,This was my second time eating at Roland's  seafood Grill the first time I had a great experience the food was excellent the service was great even though they were busy we got really good service and everything was really fresh and good this time the food was needless to say very poorly prepared the service what service we got seemed more interested and everybody but the six people setting at our table. It took a couple of tries to get refills on drinks I asked for a cup of water I didn't even get the cup of water the pasta was more like wedding soup my medium stake was almost completely pink all the way through very undercooked my nieces pasta had more onions in it then it had sauce I will never visit this place again!!! It wasn't that busy tonight but we stood there for almost 15 minutes waiting for them to get us a table. I spoke with the manager and explained my concerns to him I just can't see me spending that kind of money for the experience that I had tonight again.
0,Rough experience today - had one drink and left. Waited 15-20 minutes for service and it is not busy. When I said something - everyone wanted to blame someone else - waitress couldn't describe beer and didnt iffer to find out or sample it - brought 12 year old son a pop in a little kids cup. Waitress did apologize for cup but it was too late - chose to leave.
0,"I travel quite a bit and always enjoy great food.  I was in town on a business trip and someone recommended Roland's Seafood Grill.  I was seated promptly and given a drink and food menu.  I noticed the beer sampler and thought I would give it a try. I asked the server if I could choose the beers and she said yes.  She went on to explain nearly most of the draft beers I selected were not available as they were having trouble with their taps. \n\nI ordered a flight of beers that arrived after 10 minutes and began tasting them.  They were cold but did not taste fresh.  Next I ordered the famous \""Lobster Roll\"" which comes with fries and slaw.  It took nearly 20 minutes for my food to arrive but looked good at first glance.  The fries were plentiful and hot but greasy.  The lobster roll was served in a large piece of bread that resembled two uncut pieces of Texas toast.  It was buttered and grilled to give it a nice appearance.  The lobster inside was a small amount, cold and tough. The slaw was reasonably good and cold. \n\nThe server came back and I ordered a pint of draft beer.  After nearly another 20 minutes she returned, apologized and explained they were having more problems with their tap system and offered me a bottle of Guinness instead of the draft I ordered.  At this point I politely explained I did not want the bottled version and asked for the check.  \n\nI would be hard pressed to ever return.  With other great restaurant choices in the area I don't understand why anyone would choose to eat at Roland's Seafood Grill."
0,"Stopped in on the Fourth of July for evening cocktail and small meal. From horrible service to terrible seafood...would never return. We waited a very long time for cocktails and order to be taken, when there was little crowd around in the restaurant. Then, our oyster order came out on a plate of water, not ice. They were small and shriveled up and warm. Next, the mussels in white wine sauce....hahahah. Um, no...it was more like garbage sewer sauce. Mussels were freezing COLD. Had to search for a server to get the check, took a long time again. Normally, I would complain right then and there for such terrible food and service but it was one of those days that was going so nicely that complaining about food would just ruin mine and my husband's infrequent night out without kids. I did feel strongly enough to write this review. How can a seafood place serve terrible seafood? I have never given a 0 star review and have worked in the food service industry. This place is terrible. Spend your money somewhere else."
0,"The wait staff looked like they were bussed in from a homeless shelter. The strange hostesses seated my party of 4, & it took 25 minutes to get our first beers. Ordered an app & left 25 minutes later, the lobster nachos never came, which sucked because I was quote excited about those. The place is gross! There was food & trash all over the floor & I watched several women exit the restroom with very disgusted looks on there face because the restroom was so nasty. This was confirmed by my wife. Skip this place & go anywhere else in the Strip District"
0,"Super disappointed in this place. Came here for a paint nite they were hosting and arrived over an hour beforehand to eat. All I ordered was soup and salad in order to be quick and my friends who ordered a lobster roll and shrimp got their food within 20 minutes. 40 minutes later, and ten minutes prior to painting I still had not received mine. On top of that, there was only one bartender working the whole top floor. When we told him I'd have to cancel my order to begin the event he began cursing about the staff at the restaurant- it was incredibly awkward. When the food arrived it was mediocre at best. Will not be coming back to this place unless I'm dragged."
0,I would give them ZERO stars if it were an option. No one came to wait on us. I had to ask the hostess to send us a waiter. We'll call him Mr. Personality because he never did tell us his name. I should have known we were in trouble when he didn't bother to write down our order. My Caesar salad came without the requested onions. My grilled salmon was overcooked. The vegetables were bland. The waiter took away my half-empty glass of ginger ale and filled it with water. He never offered us dessert. The rest rooms were filthy. I would never recommend this place to anyone.
0,"Terrible tuxedo rentals! I went here 2 months before my good friend's wedding to get sized and order my tuxedo. The salesman who measured me did not know what he was doing, continued to ask someone else if he was 'doing it right' and made me extremely uncomfortable. At the moment I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt that he would get it right. When I picked it up, it did not fit!! They go through a third party and did not have an easy way to remedy the situation. They had to ship a replacement to where I was going since it was an out of town wedding. I had to return it to another Jos. A Bank store because I did not want to go back to the RPM location to see the guy that fit me originally. When I returned I wanted to see what they could do for my extreme amount of inconvenience and they hassled me when I wanted a refund! I was going to use them for my bridal party tuxedos next year, but no way now. All the employees there just said they go through a third party so its no wonder their rentals are not easier! Ha! POOR EXCUSE FOR A GENTLEMAN'S STORE. Oh, and its very very expensive!\n\nHowever, Jack from the RPM store was very kind and helped to make a bad situation better."
0,"The owner, Nicholas G Nicholas needs to attend a few driving classes before he kills someone. Maybe too much hp for him. If you see an 08 white porsche with FL plate 917 MNC stay clear. Guy drives like a nut. Almost ran me off the road in Boca Raton by 95."
0,"Sorry, but I stopped in this morning to get my lunch because I knew I would be too busy to go out for lunch.  Got a Greek Salad.  First of all, there was no lid on the salad, it was wrapped in plastic wrap... What??? Anybody could put anything in there without too much trouble.  Second when I went to eat it, I threw most of it away because the lettuce was brown and/or wilted.  Not going back again.  I didn't spend all that money for garbage."
0,"Dirty, unclean, my friend and I went to lunch here.  She went to go to the bathroom. Upon returning to the table had the following story to tell.  \n\nTo get to the bathroom she had to go through the kitchen and down a flight a stairs.\n\n When passing through the kitchen she saw raw chicken left out in the heat congealing in it's own blood. \n\n Christos you get no second chances after a stunt like that.  The food was tasty, but come on now chicken chillen on the counter is a no go in anyone's kitchen."
0,"The food was clearly microwaved (ie the ring around the soup bowl and splatters along the sides). The fish was rubbery. The wait staff, although nice, was very salesy always trying to \""add on\"" something in a pushy way. \n\nI asked for my check and barely ate anything. I think the waiter got his ego bruised because he decided to display his \""Best In City\"" award right behind my head as I was still sitting at the table... a shame the award was from 2005! I guess a lot changed in 7 years?\n\nDon't bother with this place!"
0,"Christos was one of the worst experiences I've ever had while dining in Pittsburgh. They call this a Greek restaurant but they don't even have a normal gyro on the menu. My boyfriend and I decided to split the platter, which was horrible. The gyro meat wasn't off the spick, the dolmades were the worst thing ever eaten in my life and they charged us 4.00 to split it which we didn't even ask for in the first place. The only pleasant thing about this place was the cook who ended up serving us our food after our waiter went out for what seemed like a drug deal. Over all, everything was bad and I would never return and would advice everyone else to do the same."
0,"WARNING. DO NOT GO HERE.\n\nMy family was visiting my sister in Pittsburgh and we had our eyes set on a specific restaurant, not Christos. A gentleman, I presume the owner of Christos, saw my family and I as we walked down the street. He flashed us his menu, pitching to us why his restaurant was the best and why his food was the best. I could barely tell if he was selling food or used cars. I kindly told him we were not interested. My family, however, was indecisive when it came to getting a restaurant. We ending up wanting to go eat at the restaurant next door to Christos so we backtracked. Again the owner flashed us his menu, sensing our touristy indecision. I again declined and pointed to the restaurant I was heading to. He then ignored me and pan-handled to my two sisters, mother and wife. They gave in to my dismay. As they said \""sure...\"" I looked inside the restaurant of Christos at peak dinner hours.  No one was inside.  Absolutely no one. As my family walked in and I rolled my eyes, I thought, well let's give them a chance...my whole family seemed to feel bad for the guy and I like Greek food.\n\nAs we got in, it seemed nothing was going on. We had just came back from kayaking so we needed to wash our hands. They didn't seem to have a restroom but they took my sisters and mother through the kitchen and downstairs to find one. The silence was broken when they finally put music on and suddenly a couple of kitchen helpers came out and looked like they were warming some of the kitchen equipment up.  Were we their only customers tonight? I bet we were. Before I could settle in, he casually asked if I liked pita and hummus. Obviously I said yes. He was asking me so casually when I didn't even have a menu, I assumed it was complimentary when he said he would get me some, but as I waited I found his restaurant on Yelp with my phone and the first review gave them one star and mentioned how the owner didn't tell him the pita was extra.  Great. \n\nThe rest of my family later came back from the restroom (akin to going to a restroom at a grocery store where you're around stock items...except you need to go through their kitchen). They started with salad. The waiter asked if I wanted anchovies or something else on my salad. I was going to say \""sure\"" but my wife stopped me and said it could be extra. The waiter, looking like he got caught, verified he was offering all extras to me even though earlier the owner said salads came with dinner. I had to say,\""I just want the standard salad, nothing extra.\"" I couldn't let my guard down.\n\nWe ordered some food, priced about what you'd expect.  The pita and hummus I ordered earlier was just barely average so I don't know why they thought it was worth $4. My sister ordered \""leg of lamb\"" so I expected to see a leg of a lamb. Instead when her plate came out, it looked like sad slices of ham. Really. We all got vegetables but they were soggy and unappetizing. I saw them earlier in the kitchen sitting in a big pot when I had used the restroom. Nothing here is fresh. My lamb was on the chewy side. My sister's \""leg of lamb\"" was left uneaten and she asked if I wanted some. I \""tried\"" to eat it but it was too chewy. They then asked for dessert. I wanted to say no out of my discontent but again my family members all said yes, even when they were telling me the food was not great.  I don't have their sense of pity. The desert and salad were the best things of the night, which was kind of sad. \n\nWhen we got the receipt and my wife insisted we check it.  Surprise. They overcharged us $7 from two mysterious items. Their receipt doesn't even list what you ordered. I went up the the cashier to ask them what the two items were. He tried to explain one but he really couldn't. He scratched out the $3 item. I then questioned the $4 charge. Again he tried to explain it but he really couldn't. Again he agreed with me and scratched out the $4.  On top of all this we still gave them a normal tip out of pity. I could tell the waiters were just following orders. I could tell the owner had trained them what to say and how to make extra money.\n\nYou've been warned. There's a reason why this place is doing so poorly.  There's a reason why the whole hour between 7:30pm and 8:30pm we were the only ones in the restaurant. There's a reason why the owner is begging customer to come in. They're cutting corners on customer service and food quality in exchange for salesman tactics, overcharging and tricking you to buy things you don't even know is extra. DO NOT GO HERE.\n\nOwners like this will say,\""But I have to or else I won't make it.\"" You know what? Restaurants like yours shouldn't make it. Not to be harsh but it was a poor experience. Change your food, your sales tactics and your fake receipt items strategy. Maybe a long time ago when they started they were real but now they are doing every dirty trick in the book to nickel and dime you.  \n\nWARNING. DO NOT GO HERE."
0,"This place is something STRAIGHT out of a David Lynch film. It felt like I was transported to some sort of alternate reality with the help of a smiling, and overbearing greek man outside a restaurant door preying on the weak and indecisive. Something in the air of this place comes off as so fundamentally strange, and almost, discomforting and nightmare-like. You are going to feel uneasy, is what I'm trying to say. \n\n- They overcharged us, probably intentionally. They don't have itemized receipts. \n- The waiter kept giving us options as if they were... free options that you're supposed to choose. We caught on when we specifically asked if they cost extra.\n- The elusive bathroom felt like we were descending down the staircase to hell. Better than nothing, I suppose.\n- The food.... oh my god. None of our food was good. In fact most of it was outright gross/uneatable. The hummus was decent, but... I can also get decent hummus at Trader Joe's. \n\nWe initially felt bad for these guys. A struggling business is always sad to see. But with all of the strange behavior, attempts to scam us, etc. that sympathy turned into a sense of understanding as to why this place isn't doing so well. \n\nIf the owners are reading this-- I'm sorry if my review came off harsh.. but really, please, rethink the way you are going about your business. I don't want you to fail, I want you to overcome this. Do it the right way, not the scummy way. I know you're trying, but try differently."
0,"Ordered take out from Christos.  I ordered a diet coke and it was in a cup.  THANK GOODNESS I took the lid off first.  There were HUNDREDS of large white particles in the diet coke that looked like paint chips,  eggshells or paper and did not dissolve in the liquid but remained floating around.  This is a health hazard and needless to say, I will not be ordering from this establishment again.  As for the food, mediocre at best  The baklava was average, the mixed grille kabab (chicken and lamb) was okay, dry and chewy at times but overall edible.  The salad that came with the mixed grille was decent in flavor but did have some brown old lettuce in it.  As for the cold combination, the tzatziki, one grape leaf, and hummus were fine but the tarmasalata had some ingredient which was clearly spoiled.  The cr\u00e8me caramel (greek version of flan) was floating in water, really strange texture; my guess is it was frozen then defrosted, but a dessert should absolutely not be floating in a large pool of water."
0,"Why come to this place when you have a tasty world of Italian restaurants right at your hungry fingers in this town!\n\nThe place is essentially a tourist-trap that seeks to reel in folks who are looking for a \""fun\"" looking italian warehouse (now...how would this be fun? Apparently it is to some.)\n\nDon't get me wrong...the food is not atrocious. But it certainly is sub-par. My chicken parm was quite un-tasty and seemed as if the spaghetti had come out of a can. The service was mediocre.\n\nKeep driving to Bloomfield!"
0,"We have been coming here since it opened, but will not go back after our three last visits. It has gone downhill badly. Three visits ago we were seated in the trolley and then completely ignored for 30 minutes. There was a waitress, but apparently she was new and only had the front half. I finally went out front and demanded the manager who finally assigned a waitress for us and comp'ed our meals. The lasagna was very disappointing with hard noodles and definitely not oven baked and barely warm.\nTwo visits ago to use the gift cards we intended to use on the previous visit, service was poor and food was fair.\nThe last visit last night was the third strike and SW is OUT! Very poor service and food. The drinks were all ice and refills were not timely. The server past our table many times, but she flew by each time like we were not there. The zucchini appetizer was good. We only got one loaf of bread which was barely done and came with almost no butter. No ranch dressing...really! This is the Strip District after all with many stores for crying out loud. The food was very poor. The spaghetti and meatballs had about a tablespoon of sauce. The fetticini alfredo was almost devoid of sauce, as well. My Wild Mushroom and Chicken was not warm but tasted okay. We will NOT be going back. Olive Garden and Bravos in the North Hills will be getting our business from now on."
0,"Didn't think this was possible, but it's worse than Olive Garden...food was horrible and extremely overpriced, service was decidedly lacking....  Neat location with fun and interesting decor but I wouldn't eat there again."
0,"Yes-the food is good and the portions are big.  Our waiter was very speedy and attentive.  That being said, I cannot ever go back to this place again because of the amount of bugs I saw in such a short period of time.  All gnats and thankfully nothing worse but who knows what's going on in the kitchen?  Not just a stray gnat or two but dozens just swarmed our table.  I killed one with my bare hand on the table and another one bit me and drew a (spec) of blood. Disgusting. A \""manager\"" (looked like a bus boy if you ask me but what do I know) did come to talk to us about it after my waiter noticed me covering my food with my napkin but it didn't accomplish much, no free meal or anything.  I noticed other people moving to other parts of the restaurant to avoid these bugs too."
0,"There has to be better Italian food in Pittsburgh -- I don't know why anyone would come here.\n\nI had an overnight field trip with my students to Pittsburgh & the tour company took us here for a murder mystery dinner show.  They had us sectioned off which was great for privacy & also since the students were loud.\n\nTheir service is a hot mess!!!!  They only had 2 waiters serving our 50 person group & it was not organized at all.  Just getting our drinks out was confusing.  The waiters just came out with any drink & then asked -- anyone order this??  This is why my table sat drinkless, breadless, & saladless for the longest time.\n\nFor our dinner, we were given a salad, entree, & tiramisu.  The salad was definitely straight out of the bag & doused with some cheap dressing.  It didn't taste fresh at all.  There was a list of 8 or so entrees we could choose from.  They came out quite haphazardly.  I unfortunately ordered the fettuccine alfredo -- worst ever.  I could make better alfredo using the sauce from a supermarket jar.  I tried to douse it with pepper & cheese but alas it did nothing to help it.  Some of the others said the chicken parm was alright but some said theirs was undercooked.  The tiramisu also was gross.  It definitely was made & cut awhile ago & just kept cold in their fridge.\n\nThe redeeming parts of this dinner was the decor & old fashioned coin operated games AND the mystery show.  I've never been to one & was really excited.  They started after we ate our entrees & intermissioned during dessert.  The actors were super funny & interactive -- my students loved them which of course makes me happy.  Seriously though, their food is so bad."
0,"This was the first time my husband and I have been here. We went with my sister-in-law, her boyfriend, and his sister as it is a tradition to go around Christmas for the boyfriend's family. Well, we were not impressed at all. Even the bf wasn't happy this time. We didnt have the best waitress as she would run off too quickly.for us to say much and we thought forgot about us the drinks took so long. She finally showed and said she had dropped them and had to make them again. We ordered and the wait wasn't too terribly bad for the food being a Saturday night in Pittsburgh though it was after 7 when we arrived. I didn't care much for.the garlicky butter that came with the sourdough, but the bread was hot and fresh.\n\nA balloon artist came around and made a flamingo that had to be 4 feet tall for the bf's sister and a little penguin for the SIL. He later came back, unasked, and gave her a 2 ft penguin with a hockey stick and puck in its \""hands'. \n\nWe finally got our soup, which did take a while to come out. Three of.us had the wedding soup and none of us liked it. The SIL's bf said it didn't even taste like wedding soup, but like chicken soup with meatballs. Granted I've been a little stuffy lately, but the broth barely tasted like wedding soup broth to me either.\n\nI had the fettucine alfredo, which was ok. I ate more of it than I might have were I not eating for two right now.  I added pepper because it was rather plain...not even a garnish. My husband said his spaghetti and meatballs was just ok. The bf had ordered an Italian Margarita I believe it was called and drank the first one though it wasn't mixed right as you could taste the tequila and there was no salt. He even added sugar trying to improve it. The second he gave back and the waitress didn't even apologize or take it off the bill. She went into the kitchen and started complaining loudly and our table was near the kitchen. Then she shows up with the check and we had to wait for her to come back to split it 3 ways since there was 2 couples and one other at the table. The bad drink was still there and my SIL was thoroughly pissed by then and went to talk to the manager and told him about overhearing her and all he did was take the one drink off. I noticed while reading our check that the entrees were correct, but that she had us as having a salad and minestrone when we both had wedding soup. I didn't say anything since the price was the same.\n\nThe balloons artist was great, but we won't be going back just to see him."
0,"This place is dead, but they just don't know it yet.  \n\nArrived on a rainy Wednesday around 7PM.  20 minute wait for a table, so I guess they are doing well, right?  We should have known better when we sat in the bar area to wait (me, my spouse, and my eight-year-old son) after the rather apathetic front-desk person took our name.  A couple tables taken, but no sign of staff in the bar.  Every table was dirty, covered with plates, glasses, and the remains of others.  We took one that had just a couple of glasses and an impressive amount of Parmesan cheese scattered about.  Took 10 minutes for any sign of a bartender, who promptly spent five minutes getting caught up on drink orders before wandering over.  No smile, no welcome, just \""what do you want, and are you waiting for a table\"".  And certainly no \""let me clean this table for you\"".  We had a beer and a wine and a root beer for the little one.  The pinot grigio was vile, but, hey, thanks for charging us for the more expensive version: lord knows how disgusting the cheaper version would have been.   Finally, after 20 minutes we were seated.  Not a table in the bar area had been cleaned in that period.\n\nAnd the restaurant is empty!  Maybe 20% full!  They made us wait simply because they can't staff correctly.  Acres of empty tables.  So we sit, look at the menu, check out the surrounding (few) tables and made the only good decision we made this night:  we left and found another place in the area.  A place that actually worked to seat us and made us feel welcome.\n\nThe most amazing thing:  between the greeter, the bartender, and the seater, there was not a single smile.  Not a single sign that they actually are happy that we chose their establishment.  And not a sign that that they gave a damn whether we ever wanted to come back.  No wonder it is 80% empty but still makes people wait.\n\nThe other reviews compare this to Olive Garden and the like.  As my review makes clear, I can't compare the food.  And I am certainly not a fan of the Olive Garden.  But the few times I have gone into one, I was made to feel welcome.  Certainly not here.  \n\nThe place is living off memories:  I don't think it is creating any new (positive) ones."
0,"I went to the Spaghetti Warehouse on a Sunday afternoon.   It was for a late lunch (about 2:00 p.m. when we arrived).  We were greeted by the hostess who took us to our table (which was in the trolley car).  It's a visually interesting place to dine.  However, our chairs were rickety and appeared ready to collapse. \n\nThe restaurant was mostly empty (which was not a surprise as we got there after the prime lunch hour but before dinner).  And yet although there wasn't a lot of other customers there all vying for the attention of the servers, it took an unusually long time for our waitress to arrive at our table.  (A pattern which continued throughout the duration of our stay).   \n\nOn the back of the menu, there is a section for lunch entrees.  I ordered the \""Amazing 15 Layer Lasagne\"".   The three other people in my party all ordered the spaghetti with meatballs.   The food was...okay.  Nothing to write home about.  I've been eating Italian food for almost five decades.  And this is average - at best.  I'd say on par or slightly below Olive Garden.  It wasn't the worst food, but certainly not the best.  And again, I cannot overemphasize how below par the service was.   \n\nBut the thing which really upset me was when we got our check.  They charged us dinner prices for each of our meals.   Again, there is ONE menu, and the pack of the menu has the lunch section.  It reads (until 3:00 p.m.).   What I failed to see (because it's in fine print) is the part where they only offer lunch prices Monday through Friday.   Really?  REALLY?   Are you kidding me?   That's B.S., no matter how you view it.  At no time did either the hostess or the waitress bother to explain to us up front that the lunch pricing wasn't in effect.   \n\nI HATE being ripped off.  And any restaurant which does that kind of crap is RIPPING PEOPLE OFF.   So congratulations, Spaghetti Warehouse.  You got the better of me.  And I will never, ever go there again."
0,"I wanted to like it here... in fact, I have in the past. We used to come here for college events and schedule ahead of time for a large group - then again, this was always on weeknights... when they were slow... thank goodness. I always loved the food here (then again, these dishes aren't anything scientific - they are basic - comfort food), and I thought the gigantic restaurant could handle large groups well... until I brought 10 people here for a birthday dinner on a Saturday. \n\nFirst of all, we had reservations but still stood awkwardly in the waiting area for a while to be seated. Not terrible. Then we were seated - the server was flustered and irritated before we had a chance to speak. Long story short, we waited 1.5 hours for our food (pasta... yes - the stuff you make at home for an entire family in 10 minutes), the waitress spent all her time coming to her table bashing the kitchen staff to us (not exactly professional), and the manager was no where to be seen. C'mon, manager! It's your job to sail this ship - get it together. From my line of vision, I could see about 7 servers running around like chickens with their heads cut off doing nothing but throwing the kitchen staff under the bus. Dear manager: if you have this many employees standing around doing nothing but complaining, put a few of them to work in the kitchen. \n\nThe place is cute and I really want to like it again, but I probably won't return until the management learns how to... manage. True, this isn't Capital Grill, nor was I expecting 5-star service. In all honesty, I'm from the middle-of-nowhere Ohio. I didn't even know what fine dining was until college. It's just that I've had better service at Arby's on a Friday at 12 noon when they have a line 20 people deep and cars wrapped around the building 3 times in the drive-thru. \n\nSaving grace: the sangria was good... thankfully, because that's the only thing we consumed for 90 minutes while waiting on our luke-warm dinners to arrive."
0,"Arrived at 7:15 on a Saturday night, there was a 20 minute wait although although empty tables were visible.  Got seated at 7:30, put order in shortly thereafter.  We got bread and our soups fairly quickly then sat for an hour without any signs of food.  We looked around the restraint and it was obvious other tables had been waiting and we're getting frustrated.  The waitress apologized the kitchen was slow, so we gave it another 15 minutes before we finally walked out at 9:15 still hungry.  The food I saw looked good, but I would never recommend this place.  It doesn't take over an hour and a half to make a friggin salad and pasta."
0,"This is a one time visit. The worst service ever. It was almost empty and twice we had to have someone find our waitress. The food was mediocre at best. The bruschetta appetizer for 4.99 had 4 tiny pieces of bread with some tomatoes on top. Not even shaved cheese, nothing. Total waste of money. The lasagna that they claim is so great in my opinion was diner quality, and that might insult some great diners."
0,"DO NOT GO HERE! They are understaffed, incompetent,  and slow. It was like getting waited on by 1st job people. The place smells like bleach. It's tacky too hot. They play pop music and it's supposed to be an Italian place. Not one person there ever smiled and I was treated like a body in a chair not a person wanting to enjoy a meal. Very very slow service and no authenticity in the meals. I suggest eating out of a seafood dumpster if you plan on going here."
0,Took two and a half hours to get our food. All our food was the thrown together in the same pan. Not worth the $55.
0,"Ordered delivery. The food showed up 2.5 hours later-which is acceptable, as it's (just) within the delivery window specified. However, the food had apparently been prepared within 15 minutes of receiving our order, because it was cold by the time we got it. I didn't listen to the other reviews and paid the price (literally)... if someone else is saved a crappy SW dinner by this review, my meal (or lack thereof) will not have been in vain."
0,Worst place ever.  I took my friend there for the first time and my son.  We waited a hour for food.  The waiter got us out water not our sangria  30 min later out salads and after  another 40 min of my kid begging for his pizza we decided to go.  The reason they messed up the order.  We talked to the manager I'm assuming which didn't really care.  Said hopefully we come back because service isn't usually this bad. Never again. Unprofessional and rude
0,"We went here with sixteen people. The only good thing about our visit was having dinner with a bunch of our friends. The service was pretty good to considering the large party. My wife and I got the Sicilian Sampler Appetizer and The Ultimate Feast for two, as our dinner entree. The Calamari was uneatable and the Ravioli was just down right nasty. The wedding soup was the worst I have ever had. The meat balls had absolute no taste, kind of like cardboard. The Pork Sausage tasted burnt. The Spaghetti tasted no different than Boxed pasta. The Lasagna might have had 15 layers but 12 of them were noodles and sauce, you had to search for any meat or cheese. Our garlic bread came out literally black. I can't even believe somebody would serve that. We will not be back."
0,"I stopped in here with my family the day before Thanksgiving. My sister, niece, and parents were at the Children's Museum and were struck by a fit of nostalgia--my mom used to take us here when we were kids. Either the whole operation has gone severely downhill, or I was too young to notice how bad it all is.\n\nBetween all of us, we ordered chicken Alfredo, lasagna, and cheese ravioli. Every dish had several things wrong with it. The chicken was likely cooked the week before in a dirty cafeteria then shipped to the Strip District. It was dry and looked reconstituted. The ravioli were lukewarm at best, and my sister said the lasagna tasted microwaved. Even the bread was stale.\n\nOur waitress was also forgetful and a bit cold. I didn't get a salad I ordered, dishes stayed on the table fifteen or twenty minutes after being empty, and water refills were inconsistent. As a former server myself, I'd like to think I know what is in one's control and what is out of one's control. This woman was simply not up to snuff.\n\nWith Lidia's right down Smallman Street, I have no idea how the Warehouse is staying in business. Spend a few extra dollars and go there. It'll be worth it."
0,"We've eaten a number of superb meals at the Morton's in Cincinnati, and were eagerly looking forward to a sumptious dinner at Morton's in Pittsburgh. Oh boy. The ambiance is more like a Wendy's that tries to be upscale: cramped, busy, somewhat noisy. Of the two filet mignons we had (different sizes, medium rare) one was horribly overcooked, the other one a little on the rare side. The meat wasn't special. The deserts were OK but the Creme Brulee was bland in the extreme. Service was OK but occasionally inattentive. For two adults, one child, a check of $150 would have been reasonable for the quality provided. It ended up being $350 or so. Oh well - I rounded up the check to $400 and left with the intention of never coming back again. Imagine my shock when I found that my credit card had been charged with $600! I'm sure this will turn out to be an innocent mistake, but if this restaurant thinks it provides an experience worth $200 per head, they need to call Chef Ramsey."
0,"We made a reservation and were told that seating was on time, we waited 15 minutes past our reservation time to be seated. The food was awful, my pregnant fianc\u00e9 ordered a filet medium rare that came out medium well!  Who cooks a filet medium well?  My father-in-laws strip was so over seasoned he could barely eat it.  But since we waited over an hour for our food, he had to eat it.  Our reservation was for 8:15 and we did not eat until after 10:00.  We all ordered medium rare steaks and one lobster tail.  It should not take over an hour to prepare.  The filet was taken off the bill, however, that does not help the fact that a pregnant women had to wait so long to eat and when it came out she didn't even eat.  I shared mine with her as did her dad share his, but as mentioned above, his steak was awful too.  My Cajun ribeye was good and so was my mother-in-laws lobster.  We ordered chocolate souffl\u00e9 for dessert and it didn't even have chocolate on it.  It tasted like scrambled eggs with whipped cream.  I have to tell you that was by far one of the worst dining experiences we have had.  The four of us eat out together once a week and tend to go to more \""pricey\"" restaurants.  This was terrible and I am sure we do not plan on returning."
0,"I am the dork-ie kid from your kindergarten  class. Who has been wearing glasses since I was 5 years old so please take this review seriously.  I know my way around a pair of eyeglasses.  Wow am  I getting old , that would mean I have been wearing eye glasses for 20 years.  \n\nDo me , you and everyone you care about a favor and avoid this location.  The service is here so incredibly inconsistent.  I have nothing,  I mean nothing good do say about the service that I have received here .The eye glass assistants are rude.  The way you are treated is sub par.  America's Best (I even hesitate to use that name because it's obviously not the best in America) just sucks.  \n\n Due to my terrible eye site I have to spend EXTRA money for thin lens.  So normally what I do is,  once a year I shell out $200.00  no insurance to buy two pair of glasses, paying cash.  The frames are alright but nothing that great. \n\nBesides my lens not being great another thing I  have a problem with is the poor customer service. On more then one occasion through out the years I have been talked down to. \n\n I have been wearing my current prescription from AB for about 10 months. This prescription is not good for me, before I had a magnified prescription that made everything BIGGER. My poor little blind self I have an astingamstism in both eyes. Two years ago I got good lens with nice frames but in 2012  I got shit lens with an okay frame.  I don't plan on returning to America's Best , it's just not worth it."
0,"Edit:  A customer service representative from the central office called me and was able to arrange a refund with the manager of the Pittsburgh location. Still, I think this location only deserves one star, considering one of their employees actually lied to me about the return policy, saying all sales were final, while another one said \""I don't know what you're talking about\"" when I tried to explain my problem. Very poor customer service at this location. \n\nDespite what it says on their website (30-day return policy), this location refuses to take returns, even for a defective product. I got a set of eyeglasses here which have reflections all across the field of vision. They're barely usable due to this. If I sit near a bright window, I have three reflections which show up in each lens.  These reflections go directly across the center of my field of vision.  $200 down the drain. Buyer beware."

0,"I went here around noon one day in search of an ink pad, which I thought would be a pretty standard item for a stationery store.  (Turns out I was wrong.)  The store was such a cramped, crowded mess that I had to ask for help to find what I was looking for, but was hesitant to do so because I felt so awkward interrupting the four employees sitting at a table in a corner, eating leftover pasta and engrossed in conversation, ignoring me and the several other customers who were browsing.  When I finally got the courage to ask about the ink pad, the workers all looked at each other as if to say \""Who's going to handle this?\"" before one of them grudingly got up to search for an ink pad that, as it turned out, \""didn't come in with the shipment\"".  As if Pittsburgh was a hot market for ink pads and they go through their entire supply every week."
0,"I stopped in because they have knitting supplies. I immediately saw a beautiful cat (they have several in this shop). Being a owner of several cats and extreme lover of all animals, I went over to see the cat. The cat let me pet it and followed me around yowling for attention. I picked up the cat to hold and the man that works there was very rude and ripped the cat away from me. I will NEVER NEVER go back to a store that treats animals or animal lovers that way. The shop isn't that great anyway."
0,"Such a shame because this place has so much potential for being a cool little local business. But the owners/managers are the rudest, most disdainful people who seemed almost gleeful for me to leave without purchasing something. I went in to purchase either some classy paper or a unique card to write a note to a homeowner to whom I was considering placing a purchase offer for their house. It's a stationary store, so I didn't think my request was unusual. The products there were outdated, in many cases even dusty, overpriced (which honestly, I would have paid a local business if the product had been unique and quality), and disorganized. I was asked if I needed help, to which I replied yes and explained my situation, and a very curt man stood in a back corner and pointed to various corners of the store and said, \""Look there and there and there and there,\"" AND THEN HE WALKED OUT OF THE STORE.\n\nI'll seriously never step foot in Weldin's again, and felt it necessary to post publicly about the experience. Such a shame.\n\nBTW, I found a delightful card next door at CVS. It was made of wood. Very unique. Go figure. ;)"
0,"I went down to the strip last week and thought a mocha sounded great. Well I can't write a review on that drink because the employee dropped a dime in my drink.

Yesterday she rolled her eyes at me when I asked for lots of room for cream.\n\nI am a former barista.  I *know* asking for room for cream is not one of the more difficult special requests she gets!  If you hate the public, you shouldn't work with them.\n\nThis morning takes the cake, and I just won't be back.  Here's what happened:  \n\nI walked in, and she was talking to a gentleman who was obviously a regular.  Because she was busy and bc I've barista'd myself, I waited patiently.\n\nAnd waited and waited.  It was a few minutes, but an eternity when you really need coffee!\n\nShe never even looked at me.  Then all of a sudden she goes, \""Okay lady are you going to stand there or do you want coffee?\""  \n\nWTF.  I liked her sense of urgency, but seriously?  Rude.\n\nI asked for a medium coffee in a large cup, or if that's not possible, a medium coffee with lots of room. \n\nNot hearing me, she goes, \""What was that?\"" and the older gentleman said, \""She wants a medium sized coffee in a large cup.\""  And the woman turns to me and snaps, \""And you couldn't repeat that yourself?\""\n\nEven the guy she was talking to, her regular, was like, \""Whoa.\""  He tried to make some excuse for her, like, \""She's just fired up today!\""  Then the woman slams my coffee down on the counter.  \n\nWas she having a bad day?  Am I the doppleganger of someone she hates?  I dont know, I don't care.  I believe she may be the owner because surely she should have been fired by now, as there are other posts with complaints about her. \n\n\""Do not go here during the week if you expect them to open on time. I was there today and it was 615am and there was no employees at all. Managed very poorly. The older lady with a short hair cut is the one who doesn't open on time when she is scheduled.

0,"I'd had a nail appointment set for several weeks - a first time customer.  Less than an hour before the appointment I got a call canceling it.  Not from the owner apologizing for the cancellation or trying to correct the situation somehow, but from the nail tech.  She told me the owner insisted that SHE call her clients herself to tell them she had \""personal problems\"" that day and couldn't make it.  Wow.  The lack of professionalism astounded me.  \n\nOn the positive side, I'm glad I had the experience BEFORE what may have been the worst nail experience of my life.  Imagine how the \""personal problems\"" may have affected the work.  I called the salon to let them know of my disappointment in being left high and dry.  They simply didn't care.  They lost a customer....not just for nails, but for all the other services they offer.  Not the best way to run a \""service\"" business!"

0,"As Lindsay's best friend and maid of honor, I went with her to Jim Ludwig's a few weeks before her wedding to go over the final order for the flowers.  We sat down and Jim pulled out a list of what they had discussed.  I very clearly remember her confirming dahlias and peonies for the centerpieces.  Not only do I know that she wanted these flowers from the moment of her engagement, but I was also at the consultation to witness the discussion.  The centerpieces were definitely not what she had requested - no peonies OR dahilias and they looked like flowers picked from the side of the road on the way to the wedding.  In no way did the flowers manage to ruin her beautiful day, but they were absolutely not what she requested or confirmed.  I don't understand how there was a \""miscommunication\"" as I saw the paperwork.  I just know that I won't be using Jim Ludwig's for any of my own special occassions."
0,"Specialty Luggage misrepresents customer service, does not make good on product warrantees, makes promises they do not keep and charges a premium for luggage that they falsely sell with lifetime warranties. I purchased a piece of luggage worth around $100 for almost $300 because the salesman convinced me that the luggage had a lifetime warranty. \n\nHe looked me in the eye and told me my luggage would be supported or replaced by them at any time.

He laughed at the idea that he told me there was a lifetime warranty on this luggage. I told him I was insulted that he misrepresented the craftsmanship behind this bag and overcharged me for a product that was not worth the premium he collected - he offered me 10% off another piece of luggage and said he was insulted. \n\nSpecialty luggage is staffed by slimy salesman who lie and misrepresent facts to sell you over priced products that do not justify the premiums they gauge customers for."
0,"I'm sorry, but as cool as Andy is, I just don't like the sushi.  The tuna tasted metallic and mealy, definitely not fresh.  I actually spit it out in my napkin upon first bite.  The portions are large, yes, and the prices are good, but I'd rather pay a little more for sushi that is less suspect."
0,"First, do not call me sexy and then give me the two most sinewy pieces of toro possible. That pissed me right off. \nSecond, the rolls here are sloppy. Not only did it fall apart very quickly (and was about 4 times too large to eat: a piece of sushi should be able to be comfortably eaten in one bite), but it seems there isn't much thought given to flavors as far as the special rolls go. After my experience with the toro, I don't think I will be giving any sashimi or  *sushi* sushi rolls a try. While the rolls are large, the prices were quite steep, not what i was expecting for someone based in a market that sells seafood."

Every time I kept thinking it would somehow get better, but no, it doesn't! The Miso soup they serve has this weird after taste, and to be honest, doesn't taste like any Miso soup I've EVER had! So on to the sushi, oh yeah, it's gross too! I think I kept going back because the size of the rolls are humongous. The thing is the fish does NOT taste fresh at all! It's always luke warm and....just.not.good. Oh well, I tried. But I'd suggest you not!"
0,Absolutely the worst sushi my husband and I have ever had.  It was Gross!!! I don't know why they use so much rice or why the fish wasn't cold.  You couldn't pay me to go back to this place!
0,"If you're in the mood for fresh, tasty sushi, this is not the place for you. The food that was delivered to us was simply inedible. Point blank. \n\nMy husband and I ordered a bunch of sushi for dinner with the plan of having tasty leftovers for lunch the next day, so we splurged a little, spent like $60 on various rolls. The presentation was pretty pathetic - wilting nori, leading us to believe these rolls were pre-made; hot pink ginger, meaning it's the MSG-soaked kind; glue-like rice, where you can't see the individual grains - but what really horrible was the smell. When we took the lid off the tray, the stench of rotten fish knocked both if us back. I honestly gagged.\n\nIt was so awful, we just stared at each other, amazed that we just spent our money on a pile of stinking rot. Determined to not waste everything, I picked up a piece of spider roll to sniff/inspect/try. IT HAD A HUGE HAIR IN IT, all wound around the crab. Totally disgusting. My husband attempted to try the inari - just tofu and rice, right? It tasted like rotten fish, as it had absorbed all the smells from the other fish rolls. \n\nWe had also ordered a vegetable and tofu soup, and a green salad with ginger dressing. Can't even believe this, but the salad leaves were brown and slimy on the ends! They actually screwed up a green salad. The soup tasted like the inside of an aluminum pot, all metallic and burnt-flavored. Horrible, horrible, horrible. We literally dumped everything down the garbage disposal. Total waste.\n\nWe tried to call and complain, but by the time our order was delivered, the place was closed. We will be calling again today to get our money back. Maybe they will earn themselves another star if they do the right thing and refund our money."
0,"Don't bother with the sushi, can't speak to the Korean BBQ.\n\nLong story short: I ordered delivery. Never had sushi delivered before, so maybe this is just the way it goes, but it took almost two hours to get to me. There was condensation inside the sushi container from the rolls sitting on top of the other entree I'd ordered (which was hot) and being held against it in a small bag. Assuming that the rolls were made long before I got them, I just threw out the tuna roll, which was warmer than room temp anyway. Vegetable roll was good, but not exceptional. Fried rice was...just not what I expected, not exceptional either. In short, I paid almost $40 for a cucumber roll and two bites of rice. \n\nMaybe this is better when you dine in. Still, would not recommend. Pricey and doesn't live up to it at all."
0,Being Korean and my kids and I visit all the Korean restaurants when we are out of town.  Since my daughter goes to PITT we wanted to treat our daughter to Korean food.  My family including my wife who is non- Korean always order    and if this is how they want to represent Korean food to others they are doing disservice to our heritage.   was the worst I have ever had.  Their  had lettuce as one of mixing choices and their meat was hamburger meat?  Will not go back.
0,"I am sorry to say that this place still STINKS.  I work in the strip and often get temped by Sushi Kim.  I stopped in for lunch today and I was the only person in the whole place.

0,"Pittsburgh has a shortage of riverfront dining, so this place wins points for ambience on a nice warm day. Have a drink and enjoy the deck, but save your dining budget for somewhere else.  The menu is blah and the food is also.\n\nI recently had lunch here, and the waitress first forgot my meal entirely, bringing food to everyone else at the table.  When I reminded her, she returned with my clam chowder, spilled it, didn't apologize, and didn't clean it up.  All that would have been forgiven if the soup had been any good."
0,"Awful service, overpriced food. Don't waste your money! On arrival, waitress seemed lost.  Ordered food for 3 adults, one kid, food came for adults, after a couple of minutes my mom asked when my sons food would be coming, waitress said she would check, came back and said his pizza hadnt been cooked yet. Cancelled the pizza, paid $4 for a little bowl of white lettuce with some cheese thrown on it, fried shrimp was expense, but looked like cookie cutter frozen shrimp. Spoke to manager, who had a horrible attitude and found out that the waitress never put the pizza order in for my son and then lied and told the manager he wasnt at the table when we ordered our food. If you give these people your money, it would be foolish!"
0,"The only reason anyone goes to this restaurant is to sit on the deck and drink.  I want to like this place so badly I keep coming back and hoping that it'll be awesome and it just never is.  Like dating someone who is very very hot but also very very stupid, it's amazing how much patience one can have if there's a really good atmosphere.\n\nOne year I took my father here for his birthday.  I don't usually call people names but our waitress was just a complete idiot to the point we felt bad for her and that was the ONLY reason we didn't freak out on her completely.  She forgot my dad's food order.  She brought out mine, but then neglected to notice that my dad was sitting there with nothing.  The manager came out and took our drinks off hte tab, btu that didn't help very much bc we'd only been able to order one round in an hour of waiting bc the waitress had only come to our table twice.  Then when they brought my dad's steak out, the waitress dropped it (I felt bad for her), and apparently that was their last steak.  I just paid the bill and we left and went to Eat n Park.\n\nThe second time I came back the service was equally as terrible, but also it was late summer and our table was literally attacked by wasps.  Seriously, attacked by wasps.  My friend got stung.\n\nAnother time I'd made a reservation for my friends 30th bday and they said htey didn't do reservations but could put tables together.  When we showed up, it was like I'd never called.\n\nThe last time I was there it was ok, but after being attacked by wasps my friend and I opted for the patio and only ordered burgers.\n\nThe service here SUCKS.  Getting attacked by bees and then having to wait for your server to bring you ice sucks (holding a cold beer bottle against the sting helps).  It just sucks here.\n\nBut the atmosphere is fantastic!  When your waitress comes ot hte table, just order a whole bunch of bottled beers nad you should be ok."
0,"Dear Redfin Blues,\n\nI can't begin to express my disappointment in your establishment. Such high expectations were set when we were greeted at the host stand and sent of for cocktails on a 20 min wait list (which apparently never existed). After 30 mins and seeing literally 4 parties that noticeably came in after us be seated, I reminded the host who directed us to the bar that we were still waiting. After 20 more minutes and 2 more parties getting sat (one who sat themselves) I approached a blonde woman seating and cleaning tables to let her know that we could be removed from the \""list\"". To which she replied \""what list?\"" And didn't even bother to apologize... nothing was offered to assist us in our search for sustenance nor was there anything offered for our inconvenience. Fortunately, for us, the disaster at your restaurant lead us to discover a new place, that we have decided to frequent. So, thank you for f**king up."
0,"This store has great stuff in it and we all complemented the woman working on how great the store was when we were leaving. I was with 3 white people and 1 black person. When we left, the worker pulled the black person aside and demanded to check his pockets. She did and found nothing. In the middle of the Strip District, this store can still be racist?"
0,"I hate to write mean reviews, but I really did receive the worst haircut of my life (no hyperbole) from this place, one that really can't be fixed now until I wait for it to grow out.  I walked in with long hair and normal-looking bangs that all needed significant trimming.  The stylist said he would need to take a couple of inches off of the length due to damage.  I said that was fine.  I did not ask for any other style changes.  I somehow walked out with bangs that take up most of the front part of my head, much like a small child's haircut (to serve the purpose of keeping hair out of the child's face).  He also took almost five inches off the length, instead of the \""couple\"" promised.  I feel like my haircut looks like a cross between a bowl cut, a female mullet, and the futuristic look of Mia Wallace from Pulp Fiction.  I'm pretty open minded to different haircuts, but this one is truly awful, and it's too short now for me to even pull it back easily to try to make it look better.  \n\nI'm going to a place in Shadyside today to see if they can maybe do extensions to remedy the mullet look, or implement some kind of other cut to make it look a little better.  It's a shame, because this place is downtown and so convenient to my workplace, but I certainly will not risk it again.\n\n:("
0,"As a lifelong Pittsburgher, I've been to Tambellini's enough times over the years -- and I think it's still open simply because of it's location practically next door to the Benedum, and patrons who go there aren't the regular theater-goers.  I was invited to go with friends, who were old enough to remember when it was probably good.\nThe prices are *outrageously* high for the quality of the food and portions.  I had the Chicken Marsala, which was alright, but something I normally eat served out of a chafing dish at a funeral buffet. This was comparable to a catered version and the restaurant itself deserves a funeral... It's outdated and just a factory for getting people in and out and on time to the cultural events they're going to.\nThe waitress was nice enough, seemed a bit embarrassed to respond 'no' when I asked if certain menu items were fresh.  On the other hand, she disappeared quite a bit and didn't ask if we wanted any desserts -- which we probably would've if we'd been asked.\nEven though Downtown after business hours isn't the most exciting place to eat, there are other places I'll insist on going instead of back to Tambellini's."
0,"AVOID EXCEPT FOR SHEER LAUGHS\n\nThis place is just textbook in terms of epitomizing what NOT to do in a \""fancy\"" Italian restaurant.  Meals are $30 a plate, but ask your waiter for a bottle of Prosecco and he says, \""What is that?\""  We ordered a gin and tonic, watched him make it, and were served our mixed drink literally with no ice.  Who serves a drink without ice?  We had no silverware, had to request it repeatedly.  Our entrees, dessert and coffee all came out at different times.  We received the check before being asked if we even wanted dessert or coffee, for that matter.\n\nSo - service aside, the food is just mediocre and of no relevance to the Italian inspiration it proclaims.  Our stuffed banana pepper appetizer was too hard to cut with a fork but we had no knives.  The prime rib was fatty and cold.  The crab cakes were far more cake than crab, you had to eat around it leaving a pile of filler mush.  Pasta was just pasta.  \n\nThe atmosphere is also drab and just depressing.  \n\nAnd the split plate fee is exorbitant, so we lied and shared food anyway.  Note that our check was still nearly $300 - for only five of us!\n\nReally, truly, avoid this place at all costs unless you're looking for a good story to laugh about.  The only redeeming quality here after an overpriced meal was that it left our party of 5 with a good story to tell.\n\nThis is the second time I've been here, the first time we just had sandwiches in the basement and it was also far from memorable.\n\nAVOID!"
0,"This place is just a flat out joke.  Totally overpriced.  Went before a show and they gave a limited menu and tacked on the token 20% \""service\"" fee which gave them the right to provide lousy service.  First I asked for the beer they had on the chalkboard outside.  Had NO clue what I was talking about.  Finally gave up and got a Coors Lite.  Food was overpriced and less than average.  I had the Baked Scrod.  Exact same dish at Eat N Park is $8.99 and better than this $27 dish.  I would stay clear of this at all costs.  If you are going for a night of theater - opt for eating outside the city or at Sonoma Grill down the street.  I'm shocked this place is still in business."

Stared. \n\nI have to say, I have never felt smaller in any restaurant experience in my life. Extremely disappointing and appalling. Will give our business to Capital Grille from now on.

0,"Short story: the guy smeared the sole rubber all over the shaft of my boots, said he didn't do it, tried to clean it up and took out some of the leather's dye instead, and didn't give me a refund (I'd already paid).  Moral the story: if you risk this dude, only pay him at the end after you check for damages.  Long story below.\n\nOh, Groupon, you've steered me wrong yet again.  I have awful luck with service at places were I've used Groupons overall...hey, you put out a Groupon to bring in customers, not to be pissed when said customers show up for their discounts! basically, I think the cobbler screwed me because he was only making $5 for $40 worth of services.\n\nI dropped off two pairs of leather riding boots to get new heels.  I had called and been given a quote of $20 a pair and was told that they still do same day service.  I'd had a bad feeling about the place after I called for the quote and the guy I talked to the didn't know what riding boots looked like...He thought they had a spiked heel...but I had that magical Groupon to use, so I went anyway.\n\nSo, I went.  After some haggling (and after seeing I had a Groupon), the cobbler told me that my soles were \""bald tires\"" and he had to replace those as well.  So now we're up to $40 a pair.  I said fine because I love these boots and they were quite expensive.  I was told to come back after 2pm.\n\nThree hours later, I return.  The cobbler finishes one boot immediately and hands it to me to look at.  I'm pleased and say so.  I pay.  I'd brought my own canvas tote so I start packing up the boots as they are done one by one.  And then I see it appearing on the remaining three boots...the brownish-black rubber from the soles is fingerprinted all over boot's shaft.  Oh, hell no.  Here's the play-by-play:\n\nMe: Uhhhh, I don't think this was on the boots before.  [points to blobs]\nFront Counter Lady: I don't know, but you don't understand the process.  It's not possible for that to happen.\nCobbler: [Not even looking]  Nope, I didn't do that.  That must have been there.  Looks like hair stuff.\nMe: [WHAT] Um, I'm pretty positive it wasn't there.  [Get out my phone for the photo I took of the boots before dropping them off.]\nC: Nope, wasn't me, but let me see if I can get it off.\nFCL: [begins rant about how people are never pleased, etc.]\nMe: If you look at the shaft where it hits the sole, you can see that there are smears and splatters right there.  So, it was not like this.\nC: What do you expect for same day service?\nMe: [now fuming]  For you not to damage my boots that I'm paying you to repair.\nFLC and C: [Talking over each other. Alternatively making excuses about no one else offers same day and blaming me somehow for the shoddy work.]\n[C grabs another boot to clean off and I see that whatever he's using is making it worse by taking off the dye.]\nMe: Just please give me that back.  I already paid and I don't want you to clean them anymore.\nC: You really should buy a de-salting and waterproofing treatment if you're going to wear them in the snow.\nMe: I don't wear them in the snow.  Please just give me the boot so I can leave.\nC: Okay, baby.  Have a nice day, baby.\n\nDon't advertise \""While-U-Wait\"" if you're going to gripe and do a terrible job.\n\nWhat would have made me happy, you ask?  If the cobbler had admitted maybe he had made a mistake, voided the $40 dollar charge (the other $40 was the Groupon), and offered to clean them properly for free.  I would have even agreed to run the $40 charge again AFTER he'd restored the boot shafts.  But, instead, he was a total jerk.\n\nAdditionally, the woman \""working\"" the counter had no clue about prices and had random friends using up all of the chairs for customers both times I was there.  And both times, she ignored me for a good two minutes before screeching, \""You need something?\""  Rude.\n\nFYI, previously both my mom and I had repairs at Ullrich's back when the older Calabrese gent was working and they were at the old location.  The repairs were about 75% cheaper and the service was excellent.  Honestly, I think my family started going here because of the Italian owner (I'm a quarter Calabrese myself), but I won't ever go back.\n\nResults: After applying a leather cleaning solution and using a leather shoe brush/eraser, some of the marks are up but the rest appear to be permanent.  This is after 4 hours of scrubbing.  Ugh.  Pictures are posted of the damage for your viewing pleasure."
0,"I'd like to echo the advice of another commenter: do not pre-pay.\n\nI dropped off a pair of boots for salt removal, new heels, and a polish. I was very specific about the polish, because I wanted them to look nice. When I picked up my boots, I noticed that they looked very dull and there was still clumps of wax on them. When I pointed this out to the clerk, she took them back to the gentleman in the back (the owner, I think). He said that the wax hadn't been buffed off. He gave them a quick polish and took $5.00 off the price. If he had then returned the boots to me freshly polished and shiny, that would have been the end of it. The problem was he gave them a  half-assed shine. After sitting for 3+ days with dried wax on them, a quick polish didn't remove much the dullness.  When I pointed this out to the gentleman, he said he had done the best he could. Quite frankly,  If that's the best he can do, he shouldn't be in shoe repair.\n\n I finally just gave up trying to make him understand why I was unhappy, because it was clear he wasn't going to help me, and he was becoming rude and unprofessional. I had made the mistake of prepaying. He had my money and had no more use for me. I think if I had owed him money, he would have taken my concerns more seriously, instead of becoming increasingly snarky and mean. \n\nI wish that I had paid closer attention to the other negative review about Ullirch's on Yelp (which also includes pictures) because it closely mirrors my own experience, both in terms of workmanship and customer service. The gentleman who owns the shop is sugar and spice when he's taking your money if you foolishly prepay, but quite unpleasant if you dare to complain about shoddy work. Personally, I don't mind if people make a mistake as long as they own up to it and correct it. It's when you're abusive about your own error that I take offense.\n\nIf you do chose Ullirch's, do NOT prepay."
0,"This place is horrible. The cobblers do not know what they're doing. You can get better service elsewhere for cheaper.\n\nI came to this place to get my dress shoes tapped and have rubber protection pads applied on the front half. There are logos on the bottom of the shoes and I told the cobbler to not cover the logos. The cobbler kept saying that he knew exactly what he was doing. In the end, I found out that he ground down half of the logo on one of the shoes and covered it with the rubber protection. Also, he smeared the black glue (used to apply the rubber protection pads) all over the bottom of my shoes."
0,"Food was okay, but was very surprised that they have absolutely no handicapped accessibility. Steps to get in from the street, restrooms up the stairs to 2nd floor. No accessible stalls in restrooms. Surprising in this day.  NOT HANDICAPPED ACCESSIBLE."
0,"GREAT POTENTIAL POOR EXECUTION\n\nI gave this place a try on Wednesday night.  Thought it would be a fun place for some tapas and drinks with friends.  Took a ground of 7 friends with me.  The drinks were very good, nice selection of Champagnes and beers.  My big issues stem from a very bad waiter and a menu that wasn't updated.\n\nI ordered the Charcuterie, which included torchon foie gras and duck rillettes.  When it came out it had neither of the items I was excited about.  It had some spicy sausage and some prosciutto and fresh tuna salad (not a joke).  When I asked the waiter about it he had no apologies and just asked if I wanted him to take it away. (several stars off for that).  One of my friends ordered the Croque Monsieur (a fav of mine) which was ok, but not quite good.  It seemed as if it was made by a staff member instead of a chef who knew what he was doing.  Another friend ordered the Pulled Pork Quesadilla which wasn't exactly as described in the menu either, but not bad.\n\nThe waiter came by several times to check on our drinks, etc but twice he came over to the table with his arms crossed (a huge no-no with me.)  Plus, the waiter asked for a card to run a tab for our table?  (even bigger turn off.)\n\nOverall I thought this place had great potential but its execution was way under par.  It could have been an off night, but just not sure where there are huge issues like this."
0,"Based on the AWFUL service I received the last three times I dined here I will never, ever come back to this restaurant--and it is a real shame bc I really wanted to like this place.\n\nStrike 1 (and the biggest offense) Light Up Night - I called for reservations but was hung up on and told we didn't need them.  My party of 4 arrived at 5ish expecting a packed restaurant but the place was EMPTY.  We asked for a table and were told due to the amount of reservations it was going to be an hour.  I get that--but the place was EMPTY.  The host was NOT gracious about this, instead he seemed frazzled and bothered by our being there.\n\nWe sat at the super cool looking bar and ordered drinks and asked if we could order appetizers to the bar.  The bartender, who was a complete dick, said, \""I have a full house tonight, I'm not going to take food orders at the bar.\""  \n\nI'd like to mention this guy is apparently the bar tender at the Papa J's in Carnegie--not the regular bartender who is awesome.\n\nThe place is EMPTY.  We order drinks.  And we wait, and we wait, and we wait.  All the while we can see empty tables and I kept thinking...you know...if you had just sat us we would have been out of here by now!  So I asked the bartender who was helping the host...  \""Why can't you just seat us since the place is empty, its been an HOUR and we just want to know when you think we might get seated.\""  We would have left but honestly we were invested with our time at this point.  The bartender said, \""Well, for all the people who could take the time to make a reservation, we hold a table for them.\""  Well...yikes.  If this is how you act no wonder your restaurant has been dead every single other time we have been there.\n\nWhen we finally were sat, we were seated in a tiny table wedged in a room with a huge party that was three sets of parents and like, their 36 screaming children.  It was such a nightmare.\n\nTurns out they had the regular bartender waiting tables that night and he felt so bad about our wait and where we got seated he took one of the entrees off the bill.  So that was cool, but not enough to make up for his moron coworker.\n\nStrike 2 - If you go there for lunch and you order a hamburger, expect the waitress to give you attitude if you ask for cheese.  \""Yeah, if you didn't know this was an italian restaurant and we only have mozzerella.\""  Really?  I didn't know hamburgers were traditional Italian fare.  I wouldn't have been that upset but my hamburger--which was burnt, flavorless, and tasted like freezer burn along with my diet coke came to $14.00.  For a burger.  and a coke.  The prices here can be ridiculous.\n\nStrike 3-  Empty restaurant.  I mean, EMPTY.  My friend and i are there and we had bread wiith our meals.  Our thing of olive oil was empty, and there was a full thing of olive oil on the table next to ours.  NO ONE ELSE in the same dining room.  I took the olive oil off the table next to ours.  Our waitress came over and was like, \""Ma'am, this is not a free for all, you can't just take things from the tables if you need something you have to ask.\""  WTF!  There was no one there and it was just olive oil... and also had she been attentive, I wouldn't have needed to take the olive oil.  She would have brought us a full one.\n\nSo, I've tried this place 5 times and that was enough.  I dont know how it remains open but I suspect it will close soon.  Not worth the attitude of the staff.  They dont seem to appreciate the few customers they do have which is a shame, bc when I like a restaurant I recommend it and I bring my friends there."
0,"The gelato counter was disappointing.  The woman who served us told us that it was \""rated in the top 5\"" gelatos in the country and added that it was \""from Philadelphia.\""  Isn't that the same as \""not made fresh in Pittsburgh?\""  \nWhen we asked if we could mix flavors, she said that we couldn't do that because \""it's too messy.\""  What she should have said was that the portion would be too small to able to mix.  She oh so carefully dipped less than a full scoop and dropped it in the cup.  The gelato wasn't good enough to be short scooped, even in a fancy chocolate shop in the Strip district.  Maybe they figure that the tourists who stop there won't be coming back anyway.  \nIf you find yourself at Mon Aimee Chocolat and want gelato, leave immediately and go to Mercurio's on Walnut St. in Shadyside.   There you'll find better gelato, more flavors, which you can mix, and you'll be served with a smile."
0,"There's nothing about this specific location that is bad.  It's the Einstein Bagels food itself.  I got a Santa Fe Egg wrap, and I don't understand how they can use the term \""egg\"" in the name.  There's no way in hell that slimy yellow gelatin came from a chicken!   Absolutely horrible."
0,"\""Could have bought it in a store\"" Hershey ice cream that had the crystal-y signs of freezer burn.  Totally disinterested staff included a girl that was texting when we walked in and shouting into her cell phone when we walked out.  No one gave us a bill and I had to interrupt the person at the cash register to get her to take my money.  Didn't even get a \""thanks\"" with my change.\n\nSo not worth the walk that we took to get here."
0,"I had heard about Klavon's for some time, but never found myself in that area of the Strip.  The day I did, I did not hesitate to enter and taste the ice cream that had such excellent reviews. Firstly I discovered that there was new management. They definitely did not appear happy to see me enter. I was met with hostile stares. I approached and told them I had heard many good things about this store and its wares. No breaking of the ice. I ordered and was given a scoop of ice cream the size of a golf ball for four dollars.  Save your money and time."
0,"I made an appointment 3 weeks in advance when I was texted after I left\nA voicemail. It took a couple days to schedule as the woman, Retta, forgot her appointment book one of the days. \n\nWhen I showed up to my surprise it is looks like it would be a closet...right beside the elevator, no window, an office right next door that looks to take up most of the right side of the building. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried to open the door to go in...locked. Okay I think it's just one lady named, Retta. So I waited since my appointment was at 5 and it was 4:45. Around 4:55 I lightly knocked, nothing. I gave her a call and she didn't pick up. At this point I really had to use the restroom. I waited until 5 and knocked normally so that it would be heard. I sent her a text touching base and asking for the bathroom code. Around 5:05 I knocked again. 5:12 I called again and left her a voicemail letting her know I'd been waiting and would wait another 3 minutes before leaving and contacting Amazon local for a refund. I asked a few people if they'd ever been there and go the responses were all no. A few people I'd run into on my way knew where it was as they pointed it out to me. Around 5:15 the same men came back around and one knocked very loudly for me and they found me the bathroom code, thank god! So I come back at 5:20 and knock one last time. I left and have not heard from Retta and it is now 5:40. I'll be reaching out to Amazon Local for sure."
0,"I'd give it ZERO stars if i could. Worst customer service! My husband made an innocent mistake and confused the weekends for our trip back to his home town. We asked that we get the credit and offered to add a night to our stay. The hotel would be out NO money. But these corporate suits refused. So - they've lost a customer - a PLATINUM customer. We've given Marriott so much bloody money over the years, but these greedy suits could care less. A little goodwill would have cost them nothing. Where has good customer service gone????? Truly pathetic. And believe me - theres nothing special abt this hotel. The William Penn, the Doubletree, and several other hotels are FAR FAR FAR superior. Get good rates on Priceline. Heck - i'll even give a shout out to the Renaissance downtown -- it's not owned by the Courtyard jerks. Good luck! Go Steelers!"
0,"When I checked in, the front desk staff was missing.  When I checked out, the front desk staff was missing.

On the second call, I was put on hold for ten minutes before I gave up.  On the THIRD call, I asked the clerk to email me a copy of a form, and she informed me that the scanner was down and she would be unable to for several days.\n\nThe pillows were appalling and there was no complimentary breakfast and no refrigerator.\n\nDoes ANYBODY run the show here??  What a disgrace to the Marriott name."
0,"Literally worst service i've ever received at a hotel. Was using a conference room for multiple days and had to beg snooty staff to come refill waters and clean the room. Also, policies like how much parking costs seem to change from visit to visit. \n\nTo sum up, i cringe thinking i'll ever have to speak to the people at the front desk again. The location is amazing, they have that going for them. \n\nDo not stay here. You will be disappointed."
0,"This hotel is well located. However the staff, especially Zac don't care a bit if you have elite status or not. The staff is young. The manager nowhere to be seen. No upgrades. Room has high ceiling. So what. Not personal at all strictly business. Restaurant no great shakes. One of three. The better restaurant is the little cafe across the street owned by same owner. Bellhop seen limited times. To get a cab walk to the Westin across the street. Or take a bus. No hello on entering. Not friendly. So why stay here? Not a 4 star. Really a 3 star. Point redemption way too high. Nothing to recommend. Stay at the Westin across the street and kiss the staff there goodbye. Run. Don't walk away.  Not even the shuttle goes anywhere useful. \nLinda b august 2013 will never stay again!"
0,Do no stay here if you plan to sleep before 2:30 AM. They could not care less that there is a very loud bar directly across the street. If loudness doesn't bother you than this place is fine.
0,"Yuck I have avoided this Subway like the plague. It's too bad that this location is the most conveniently on the way to my job.  \n\nI literally walk past this Subway 5 times a week.  Even at 1:15pm it's never packed there for lunch and the reason why is  because their sandwiches stink. \n\nWhen I say gross I mean that the standards for food are as low as the standards for cleaning. \n\nThe attitude of the workers here is just pitiful. The don't care about making a good sandwich nor do they care about keeping the place clean. What a wreck. \n\nAs some one who eats at Subway 3 times a week I feel entitled to my opinion, avoid this subway."
0,"Incredibly slow, worst club I've ever had...hilite was the tortilla soup. That was actually edible. Waiting 40 minutes for a cold club and cup of soup is totally unacceptable. Especially when we were the 2nd table seated of the day."
0,"I treated my younger sister and kid brother out to dinner , to recognize their high PSSA scores and over all academic success so far this school year.  What can I say the kids just love this place.\n\nFor me the food was terrible.  I wouldn't even have cooked this way for an enemy. I got the cabo shrimp salad. This was four tiny dried up shrimp served in a bowl with ice berg lettuce an rotten tomatoes.  \n\nThe kiddies had Beatlejuices which is grape juice and Sprit with a gummy worms. They also had Oreo milk shakes which they demolished and said were super yummy. \nEach of them for dinner also had a cheese burger. The burger was juicy and delicious. \n\nI have to comment on th bathrooms. They are in terrible shape. The toilet paper rolls are broken so instead of fixing the toilet paper rolls Max and Erma's just sit the roll of toilet paper on top of the broken toilet roll. I couldn't believe it!"
0,"I had previously reviewed the Golden Palace buffet, stating that it was some of the worst Chinese food I've had.  Well, this place manages to be worse than it.\n\nThe place is rather run down.  The buffet was really terrible.  Food left to sit out in just its oil and a barely lit heat source.  It just wasn't a great environment.  Try something else, definitely!"
0,"I can't tell you how bad this place is, regretted not looking up on yelp for reviews before ordering for delivery.\n\nSeriously this place has the worst Chinese food I've had in my whole life!!!!!!!!!!"
0,Bad!!! Worst Chinese food in Pittsburgh!
0,Dined in. Food had obviously been sitting out all day at the buffet. Lo Mien was soggy and had unidentified black grit in it.  Broccoli was clearly unwashed whenever it was cooked. Finally I ordered beef with broccoli and the meat looked pale like chicken but tasted to gamey to be chicken or beef. First time I ever wondered if I was being served cat.
0,Stopped in for a quick drink on new years eve about 3 pm . The place was empty . The bartender Chris was rude and very vulger . He made a crude sexual comment as soon as we sat down . We decided to stay for a drink anyway . After going a couple of choices we were told the bar was out of most stock . On New Years Eve ??? The Bartender kept complaining about his job and bosses for the next 10 minutes . We paid for our drinks and got up and left . Might be the strangest employee experience I had in awhile .
0,"Every time I come here, hoping, just hoping that I'm going to have a couple delicious hotdogs. Raw. Unfiltered. Old school. Like a ballpark from the 1920's or something.\n\nBut each time I come away disappointed, even more than last time.\n\nMy father worked here three or four decades ago. I'd love to love this place and recommend it to my friends.\n\nThe service is anywhere from good to great, and they are fast and friendly!\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, I come when the hotdogs have been sitting on the grill too long. At odd hours. or an hour after the rush.\n\nEvery time, the hotdogs (and brats) are harder than a rock.  Not a snappy casing, no, this is like barely edible hard exterior.\n\nSo what's a man to do? Try again?  Sadly, I'll probably forget about my recent experiences, and try them again.\n\nI just hope they are fresher next time, because I can't imagine them worse than today."
0,I walked into Sammy's expecting a ny style corned beef sandwich and that is not what you get. I don't think Sammy has ever even had a good corned beef sandwich. Meat was dry under seasoned and Luke warm. The bread was just sliced supermarket bread. I hate to say it but giant eagle makes a better sandwich than this place. Don't waste your time
0,"If you plan on getting married here please ask them what their rules are regarding wedding photography and videography before you book.  They have very strict rules here and your hired professionals will have severe limitations on where they can be and what they can do.\n\nUnfortunately I see this kind of thing all too often and the church's reason being that they want to \""preserve the sanctity of the ceremony and the religion.\""  Meanwhile guests are taking video and photos with their smart devices.  If churches, like this one, wanted to preserve the sanctity of the ceremony than their rules should apply to all, not just the people hired by the couple to be there."
0,Rules made by men. Check them before you book this church to get married or any other event. Their restrictions are far beyond respect and more on the ridiculous side. Stay away from this church.

0,Mahoney's is the type of place where women are accosted by the bartender as my girlfriend was this evening. Don't go!
0,"After a work happy hour a few doors away, several of us were looking for a place to eat, and were having a hard time deciding. I was the pain in the tukkhas, since I'd driven my antique car, and kind of needed to be able to park it where I could see it, plus, I'd really planned the evening to be a birthday dinner for one of the co-workers. We decided to split up, and me and the birthday girl go somewhere, and the rest would hit something within walking distance. Then as Birthday girl and I got to my car, we realized we were parked in front of a restaurant, and Mahoney's won out by default.\n\nWe should have gotten in the car and driven somewhere else.\n\nThe atmosphere was pleasant enough, but the food...yeesh.\n\nEveryone placed their orders, mostly sandwiches of one variety of another, sided with fries, plain or sweet potato, or slaw. I ordered the Reuben hoping for the best, but definitely not receiving it.\n\nMichael's chicken breast with plain fries arrived with sweet potato fries, and instead of just bringing him a side of regular fries, they took the whole plate back to make the switch. Kim's turkey Rachel arrived, and as it was handed in her direction, half of the stuffing fell off the plate and onto the floor. The server took the plate back to the kitchen so that Rachel could be re-stuffed, and for the rest of the evening her initial guts laid right there on the floor. Kim #2 had a fried fish sandwich, which looked a little withered, and then there was my Reuben. More like an Ewwwwww-ben.\n\nThe bread was dry as chalk, and the corned beef had been so overdone, it looked like bacon sticking out of the bread. Dry, dry, dry...and I took maybe two bites of the slaw, and that was quite enough.\n\nThe prices aren't steep, but seriously people, take some pride in what you're handing off to a customer. Would YOU eat that?? Seriously, put that order down on the counter in front of you...and take one minute to LOOK at it...then make one exactly like it for yourself. Are you gonna eat that? If not, um, why would we want to pay for it?\n\nThe service was pleasant enough, and the atmosphere was comfortable enough for nice conversation. But would I go back? Nope. The food, my reason for going to a restaurant, was dreck.\n\nMy apologies to my co-workers for forcing them to try it along with me."
0,Terrible. The food they brought us didn't match what was on the menu. They brought out a different wine then we ordered and didn't tell us until we ask. They messed up out bill. They didn't accommodate for a member of our group that had an allergy. The beer was skanked. The soda was flat. Possible the worst restaurant I was ever in.
0,"Worst experience at a restaurant ever.  I don't need anything fancy but this was pathetic.  My coke was colored water, when I sent it back she said they just changed it.  Came back and said we don't have coke, would you like a sprite.  The sprite was flat but I was afraid to order a water after that.  Why didn't we just leave then.  The menu had quite a few spelling errors we joked about but no joke - don't go here.  If I could rate this a zero, I would."
0,"This is a review for the AMTRAK CAPITOL LIMITED train route between Pittsburgh and Chicago.\n\nRiders beware. This is  a nightmare and a completely unreliable mode of transportation. Norfolk Southern owns these tracks. Unbeknownst to the lay traveler there has been delays BOTH ways on this route for the past 2 to 3 months.  Freight cars get preference. 7 mile stretch in Indiana with only one track.  Delay was 6 hours going to Chicago and over 7 hours coming back. The staff are trying to do their job but seems like the situation is out of their control. Amtrak fails to let customers know realistic arrival time. Terrible experience, I give it a F."
0,"This place was horrible. Did not, even for a moment, have a seat on the chairs while i waited to board the next train. The walls were dirty, nasty and dingy. It smelled awful inside. It was quite crowded. And I just did not like my surroundings.\n\nAnd dont let me get started on the restroom. after seeing the filth in here, i decided to walk down the street at 5am in the freezing cold to the greyhound station nearby to use their facilities.\n\nThere was absolutely no type of cafe or even little convenient store within this station to grab a bite to eat while you wait. I did find a vending machine to get coffee but even that was watered down. \n\nThis place needs to be torn down and rebuilt from the bottom up. I waited with my family down the street at a different station before we had to be back to board our train. \n\nI will be sure to not have this place in any of my future stops. Not a good way to sell the city...Horrible!\n\nThe only reason why i give this station 1 star is because the train itself was quite comfortable and clean."
0,"Unbelievably bad! If the roach crawling up the wall doesn't scare you away the terrible fried rice will. The egg rolls have only cabbage in them. The \""chicken\"" is dark, fatty, and inedible. Don't miss the 100 pound tub of MSG as you walk in. I paid for my food ate half my egg roll noticed the roach, food was then delivered, I took one look at it and threw it out, and left. You should skip this place for sure."
0,Did not enjoy my meal what so ever.The staff was cold and the seating area was dirty. The place was more of a hole in the wall then I can appreciate. Cheap but your getting what you pay for in quality.
0,"If a place downtown isn't busy at lunch time then either you're much more wise than the hundreds of thousands of professionals OR the place stinks.  Fu Lai is the later.  \nThe food was gross and I usually wouldn't say that about a place.  My General Tso's seemed to have been previously frozen and I think I got 100% gristle.  I don't shriek at the sight of MSG, but this place uses a bit much.  I got a whopping 2 pieces of wilted broccoli and 1 sliver of onion in my dish and the sauce ewww the sauce.  Not sure why I stepped into Fu Lai, probably because I wanted some cheap Chinese.  Never going back."
0,Worst Chinese I've had in Pittsburgh. I ordered pork fried rice.
0,"The preparation was fast and the price was very reasonable but it doesn't make up for the fact that everything had a bad, weird taste and the food inevitably made us very sick afterwards.

0,"Do not use this dry cleaner. The staff/owner smokes in the store. There are ash trays and packs of cigarettes lying around. I had to \""air out\"" my clothes after I picked them up from Galardi's to try to get rid of the cigarette smell. YUK!"

0,"DO NOT GO HERE! They staple your name to your clothes because they can't handle organizing your things. Even with that, they've lost my clothes before. And now I just got a $110 sweater back from being dry cleaned and the loop to hold the tassel on is ripping off. They are clearly incompetent. Not only that, the place smells like an ashtray when you walk in. How are your clothes even clean when they come from that? Awful."
0,"Not only did they damage a sweater, they told me they would take care of it with my tailor and never did.  On top of that, they write in PERMANENT MARKER on your clothes! Unbelievable! Stay away from this place.  Take the time and take your clothes somewhere else."
0,"I used Galardi's for ~ 4 months when I first moved to Pittsburgh. I've since changed cleaners. I think Galardi offers great service for pick up and deliver dry cleaning in the downtown area. The owner is actually a nice lady; but, after nearly having 3 shirts ruined I decided enough was enough. \n\nI think their delivery guy is a huge part of the problem, I actually like the owner, but I can't keep having my clothes messed up and not have anyone take responsibility for it. I wish I could tell people to go here but I can't do it in good conscience."
0,"The restrooms looked like after an bombardment, an improvised shack amid buckets of olives and spices. Highly questionable hygiene for a food store!Disgusting. I will not go back until they clean up the place. It's just filthy!!!"
0,"Have been going to the Pennsylvania Macaroni Company for years. Love their fresh pasta and great selection of cheeses. Always great service, however today was the exception. Rudest woman at the cheese counter. Then went to get the fresh pasta and the woman behind the counter was downright nasty. She was covering the pasta at 4:00, they close at 4:30 and I asked her if it was to late to get pasta. She rolled her eyes at me and said uh yeah-we are putting it away right now. A simple yes or no would have been nice. I said ok thanks anyway. Then she must have reconsidered and said well did you want something??? In a very rude voice. Needless to say I walked away. Wow! Pennsylvania Macaroni Company needs to work on customer service. Obviously she hates her job, then get another one! If I didn't drive so far to get there I wouldn't have written this review. Every January I buy 3 months worth of cheese for my family members. I won't be doing that anymore."
0,"I went to Lidia's this past week for dinner with a group of 6 friends. The service was one of the worst I have ever had. The waitress was rude to us from the minute we didn't order alcohol to the second we signed our bills. We politely asked at the time of placing our orders if it would be possible to have separate checks. It's a group of people having dinner together, who carries cash anymore?  Waitstaff should expect to be asked for separate checks. I understand it makes for a bit more work to run a few more cards at the end of the meal, but when the waitress disdainfully states \""I can do that, but you will just have to be patient with me at the end of your meal as separate checks cannot disrupt the service of my other tables.\"" it is a big indication of how the rest of the evening would go. If she gave as much inattention to her other tables as she did to ours, no one would have even noticed she was taking a few extra minutes running separate checks. We rarely saw our waitress except when she needed to sell us food. Thank goodness for the other staff that were available to refill our drinks, our bread and our pasta. Otherwise I think we would still be sitting there 4 days later with empty glasses and stomachs!\n\nSpeaking of empty stomachs-I wish I hadn't filled my stomach and emptied my wallet with the food we were served. I ordered the pasta trio. The salad was good and unfortunately the best part of my meal.  I was excited to try the 3 pastas when they came out. But that excitement quickly disappeared as I took a few bites. Seriously?!  A revered Italian restaurant serving overdone pasta?!  It was the most bland arrabiatta sauce I have ever had. The jarred stuff I have in my cabinet at home has a 100 times more flavor than this and I don't even serve that over such limp noodles as what this place did. The pesto sauce on the gnocchi was good, but again the pasta was well past it's doneness. The best pasta was the gemmeli with the sausage/broccoli rabe sauce, but it was extremely oversalted and left my mouth feeling like it does after I've eaten too much ham on Easter. \n\nI had high hopes that dessert would salvage this meal!  Unfortunately, those hopes were dashed when we ordered the nutella custard that was to come with caramel bananas. The waitress said that they didn't have bananas for it because their shipment they had received that day were too green. The restaurant is in The Strip District!! Go down a few blocks to Stan's Market and buy ripe bananas to serve with your dessert!  She was going to serve a custard with nothing else until my friend suggested that they use strawberries that were listed on another dessert as a substitute.  The dessert was good, but I would have definitely preferred bananas over the strawberries we ended up with. \n\nLidia's had been on my list of restaurants to try ever since it opened years ago. I can now mark it off my list and never return. Between the waitress's attitude towards us all night to the quality of our meals, it was one of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had. So disappointed!"
0,"What an embarrassment. Rotten/black  salad greens. A server with a black eye. Pedestrian \""signature\"" pasta. Plates and glasses left uncleared. Greasy, scratchy plates at buffet. All yours for $28 per person!"
0,"Went yesterday after my daughter's college graduation.  When the grad ceremony ran longer than expected, I called the hostess to let her know we had been delayed but were departing and hoped to be there soon.  As we were sitting in traffic, I received a call from a man who identified himself as the general manager and rudely asked if I still intended to be dining there.  After I explained our delay and that I had just spoke with the hostess, he (again very rudely) wanted to know how much longer I thought it would take for me to get to the restaurant.  \n\nWe arrived at Lydia's about 30 minutes late for a mid-afternoon reservation.   There were several large parties but quite a number of open tables.  Upon presenting at the hostess table, neither the hostess or the general manager acknowledged us for several minutes while they continued some discussion between the two of them.  We were seated at a small round table tucked in a corner - very small for a party of five.\n\nOur server arrived and explained the menu, which was the buffet brunch at the time. He spoke so quickly and mumbled so much that we had trouble understanding him.  We ordered our drinks and he indicated he would take our order when he returned with the drinks.  He later returned without our drinks and told us that they needed to break down the buffet to prep for upcoming dinner service so we could not have the antipasto or dessert portions of the brunch. Instead they would charge us ala carte but we would be limited to the entrees on the brunch menu and they could provide a Caesar salad or cup of soup.  He the left and returned later to take our order - still no drinks. \n\nWe eventually received Caesar salad (not fresh, limp and overdressed) and drinks.  We were seated within view of the antipasto buffet and were able to observe that we were on to the service of our entrees well before the antipasto buffet was broken down. Clearly there was no reason that our menu needed to be so restricted.  \n\nFood was ok.  Chicken was salty and overpowered by capers.  Individuals who ordered pasta trio indicated two of three were good.  Unfortunately, the table set up required the server to hold the pasta skillet over my lap in order to serve those seated on the other side of the table.  No mishaps but a few close calls.  Amounts provided in first serving were small and it was nearly impossible to get an additional serving.  Two individuals never did receive the second serving of one of the pastas that they requested.  We were able to order from dessert menu.  Desserts were unremarkable and very small.  \n\nService was horrible.  Our server did not return.  Took great effort to flag him down for additional drinks.  House wine and mimosa were overpriced at $12 and $13 respectively given size and quality.\n\nGentleman bussing our table was the only positive of our experience. He was friendly and accommodating.\n\nI will not return again and would discourage others as well."
0,"Not impressed by this restaurant.  Ordered the pasta trio, which was recommended by the waitress and was labeled on the menu as \""all you can eat\"".  The staff service gave small portions of each and hardly returned for further portions.  If I wanted \""all you can eat\"" I would have been at the restaurant all night waiting to be served.  The pasta was cold when served.  The frozen pasta from my son's school fundraiser was better.  I would not recommend nor would I ever return."
0,"What a disappointment. When the water glass cracked in my hand as the server poured and soaked us, we should have known it would be that kind of evening. Worst part of the meal was the pasta trio--the limpest, pastiest, most tasteless mass of lukewarm pasta I have ever been served. One waiter saved the day by insisting I reorder, while everyone else in the joint was content to let us stew. Every aspect of the experience was substandard although when I reordered, the beet salad was very good. Overall, Lidia should be ashamed to have her name on a place like that."
0,"Lidia, you should be ashamed! This spot wouldn't have lasted a year in NYC. Citizens of Pittsburgh, don't be fooled. Lidia's is average at best. I ate here when it opened,a and again 4 years later. Nothing has changed. We did have some great bar nibbles, quality cocktails, and a good bottle of wine off of a pretty good list, but the food and service lacked. For starters we were served ice cold meatballs and limp soggy salads. The took away everything and only brought back fresh salads (mind you, we were one of about 10 tables being served that evening!). The entrees were dull and lacked seasoning. The servers were confused (how many times does it take to ask fro fresh pepper?) and our waiter seemed to hand off our table to another server. It's tough to find anything good here. Just another 'poser'."
0,I had really high expectations for this place but the food was overpriced & bland my lasagna tasted like it was made by Stouffers. The service was excellent the food nothing great.
0,"This place is pretty poor and really needs to get it's act together because it's a disgraceful place to watch football, especially given the accessibility of technology these days.  First off, it is desperately in need of some updates.  There are old crappy projector screens and a few big rear projection TVs, but not an HDTV in sight.  There are TVs aplenty, but they just feel dinghy and outdated and the reception on every TV is snowy.\n\nThe biggest issue, however, is that apparently they're only able to show 6 games at any 1 time throughout the huge bar area.  There are several main bar islands, booths, and pub tables all over with individual TV screens at each booth.  Sounds good, but what good are all these seats if you can only show 6 games?  That is absurd when you consider how huge Sports Rock is, especially during college football.  I went to watch a game that was on regular old ESPN, and they weren't showing the game.  You mean I could go to my hotel to watch the game but am unable to watch it at a \""sports bar\""??  Give me a break.\n\nFood is also generally terrible.  Nachos are no better than what you can get at 7-11 and sandwiches have no flavor.  And service is piss poor and understaffed.  I'm not sure if they recently changed ownership or what, but something was very very off here and they were obviously unprepared for the start of the football season.\n\nI feel bad because the people were very nice and apologetic, but that does not take away from the fact that even if they were showing my game, I think I'd still rather watch it in my hotel room."
0,"I think that typically sports bars are really not expected to have good food.  They just need to have four things\n1. ESPN\n2. Nachos pilled high with all kinds of stuff\n3. beer specials\n4. big screen TVs.\n\nWell Sports Rock failed on all accounts.  I was encouraged when we walked in and saw individual TVs on each table.  Of course we picked the one that didn't work!  Then we realized while there were many out of market games, the Virginia Tech one was nowhere to be seen. So we politely ask for ESPN.  Not ESPN U or 360 or anything fancy.  Plain old regular ESPN.  Then we get some story about how they only have six recievers.  Thats fine.  But why am i watching the Maine/Iowa game.  SERIOUSLY.  I was also annoyed that when the cute girl walked up to the bar, he had the Georgia game on within minutes. \n\nThe nachos were absolutely disgusting and my wrap just leaked oil and disgustingness.   The fries were even terrible, but i found if you dipped them in the gross nacho cheese, they weren' that bad.   \n\nPlus, beer was 4.75!  Multiply that by a 3 hour game and you're paying a lot.  Service was awful and i think i would get better reception on a tv with rabbit ears.  Overall this place sucked, although i will give them credit as we were finally getting up to leave and go to an Irish Bar that was able to show ESPN, i noticed the hokie game all the way back in the corner.  Took them long enough.\n\nIf you're ever in Pittsburgh in need of watching ESPN heres my idea.  Grab a permanti brothers sandwich and a six pack of beer and watch it in your hotel room rather than waste your money to sit and watch Maine vs Iowa on a crappy little tv with no reception."
0,"Too oily , i felt like im eating pure fat , even the bread is covered with oil ! I suggest they make it healthier with more whole wheat option, grape leaves are very dry and tasteless. Oh and their fries are terrible"
0,"Came here on a Sunday, it was slow and we got our food in good time.\n\nOrdered two personal size pizzas, spicy fries, fried zucchini & onion rings. \n\nThe pizzas were actually really good but the other sides weren't worth it. Tastes plain & over cooked. \n\nOk so the reason why I'm giving this place 1 star is because I saw soooo many health code violations! \n\n* A RedBull can on the pizza dressing table.\n\n* The woman who charged me was working on a pizza and didn't even wash her hands after she charged me! She just went right back to working on making the pizza! \n\n* The same woman who charged me -NOT kidding ...her nails were long & yellow, mind you she wasn't wearing any gloves while putting that pizza together. YUCK!! \n\n* Same chick went out for a cigarette break (in the front of the place) and when she was coming back in she brought AND blew the smoke inside the restaurant. \n\nPrice range in Yelp language is $$\n\nI definitely won't go back because if that's what I was able to witness in the front of the place, I don't want to imagine what's going on in the back!!! I don't think I'm being harsh. That was one too many violations in my opinion."
0,"Okay, so I've heard a lot of good things about this place. And I wanted to like it!\n\nBut it was seriously bad. I very rarely eat somewhere and don't finish my food simply because I don't like it. But I couldn't eat it. I got the Shadyside and it was super greasy, and the flavor just wasn't there. My roommate got the Portabella and she wasn't feelin' it either.\n\nThe guy who served us was cool beans though."
0,"Good food worth waiting, and waiting, and waiting for...  Now wait & wait for the check."
0,"The absolute loudest hotel I've stayed at in a long LONG time. Paper thin wall,  poor booking practices ended us up in the middle of the most obnoxious wedding party ever. Drunk bride, hotel room parties until 3am, and an apparent lack of security to monitor anything going on in this hotel have lead to this rave early Saturday morning (and I do mean RAVE quite literally) review. And yes this was after the front desk was called several times with noise complaints. My best tip would be to not stay here unless the purpose of your stay is to not sleep."
0,"I'm going to keep this short and sweet. Err not too sweet. I live in Bloomfield near the Childrens Hospital. Took my moo moo pie on a walk down (about 25 minutes in the RAIN) to Bow Wow or whatever just to see what they were about and to kind of get a feel for what type of doggie day care this was and some general information.\n\nNot only when I came in dripping wet from the rain there wasn't anyone up front to greet me. She brushed me and my dog off when I asked her about more information. She had an attitude with me didn't really care to go in depth with me about anything. It was kind of \""We do this we do that\"" I ultimately ended up walking out on her mid-sentence. Complete waste of time. I don't usually write negative reviews but geeze if you treat animals better than you treat people fine but I at least deserve some respect.\n\nHer overall attitude was \""I don't even know you I don't even care to know you unless you want to pay for our services.\"" If that's the attitude you want to have I'll pass."
0,completely worthless wifi.
0,"After looking at the hotel online I was excited, the pictures looked new and very nice. I was in town attending a conference at the convention center so along with how great everything looked, you couldn't beat the location. \n\nHowever, I had the absolute worst hotel experience at the Pittsburgh Westin. I am a Starwood Preferred Guest member and up until now have had great experiences, but this one was so bad it really makes me question the integrity of the brand and I am hesitant to stay at another Starwood establishment. \n\nEven tonight as I try to log into my SPG to see if my points for being \""conservative\"" with the room were updated, I can't logon to the site as \""The system is temporarily unavailable.\"" I should also note I have photographs of everything, because I couldn't believe how bad the stay was. \n\n1. The terrible experience happened before I even arrived. When I googled the hotel, accusations of bed bugs appeared on both Yelp.com and Bedbegregistry.com - and the hotel had yet to take the time to respond. A simple detail that if someone was paying attention they would be able to resolve. \n\n2. I arrived at the hotel after a 7+ hour drive only to find out that the bathroom in my hotel room was broken. After two calls to Guest Services, about 30 minutes later a maintenance man came by, and it took him about 15 minutes to fix it. So a total of 45 minutes before I could use the rest room after arriving. I had suggested to Guest Services on the second call that they move me to a new room and it was awkwardly laughed off. \n\n3. After using the restroom (finally!) I noticed the tub was dirty and there was mold on the top of the shower by the rod and on top and inside the mini-fridge. The mold was \""new\"" so it could have easily been wiped off and taken care of if the room was being properly clean and attention to detail was paid. The fact that the hotel lacked the ability for such simple house keeping was surprising. \n\n4. The paint in various places of the room was chipping and some of the furniture, most notably the side table were knicked and scratched badly. \n\n5. Because of the bed bug reviews, I stripped the sheets to look for evidence. I did not find any, but did become aware of many brown and black tar stains on the sheets that were tucked in to the mattress. \n\n6. I begrudgingly ordered room service because of how late it was by the time I got settled. I ordered the Turkey BLT with lemon aioli and arugula salad. Instead I got cold, what-seemed-like-day-old deli meat, burnt bacon with a thin, thin layer of mayo, not aioli. The arugula salad did not have 1 piece of arugula - it was mixed greens with shredded carrots instead. When you read the description and look at what I actually received, it is very, very disappointing. \n\n7. The coffee pot in my room leaked all off, wetting the sugar, napkins, etc. \n\n8. They charged the wrong credit card after both myself and my office manager telling several different people which card to charge. I had booked the room on a corporate card, and my office manager had believed she straightened everything out at the front desk that they were to charge the card on file because I would not have the corporate card with me. The first thing I was asked by the front desk was for a credit card. After I explained the situation to the front desk, they insisted that the card on file would be charged and they just needed my card for \""incidentals\"" - after back and fourth I gave in and gave them my card, assured it would not be charged. Then when I checked out two days later, I once again confirmed that they would charge the card on file and they still charged the wrong one.  Fast forward to the following week when I notice the charges, I called the billing department and someone has still yet to return my call. I am being charged interest on this card for their mistake. \n\nThis was an absolute terrible experience and I am very disappointed at the Westin and Starwood Hotels for their obvious lack of pride and detail with this hotel."
0,Really poor service and way overpriced. You could make much better choices.They do not keep to a high standard of service.\nThe rooms are not worth the money.

0,"My parents and I came here after my dad had boasted about how good there food was and that he would bring his HP customers here for lunch. Upon arrival we immediately were ignored so we ended up seating ourselves. \n\nThe place was unacceptably dirty, our table was dirty the floor was dirty, heck even the walls seemed to have a layer of grime. Both the waitress and the bartender were extremely  rude. \n\nMy mom and I got a beer and my dad tried to order a martini, immediately we received dirty looks from both the bartender and the waitress, they said they didn't have them so my dad asked for straight vodka in a glass to which she brought a shot  of vodka instead. I understand it's not a full bar or a classy place but to serve alcohol and react the way the servers did was ridiculous!\n\n I ordered a grilled fish sandwich that lacked flavor and was horrible greasy, the fried scallops were disgusting.\n\nI understand that the restaurant has seen better days but wow, will i be going back, methinks not!"
0,This restaurant is horrible.  The waitress was rude and tried to rush us.  The only oyster on the menu is a terrible patty of some kind.  How can you call yourself an Oyster House and not serve either fried oysters or raw???  The food overall was ok.  I would never go or eat there again!
0,The worst most over breaded oysters ever...It's a dive to boot.
0,"Only has 1 person working and serving the restaurant. Took 15 minutes to be asked if I wanted a drink, another 15 minutes to get a menu after asking for one. Annoying wait, they need to hire more people"
0,Oyster shooters in a plastic cup. Looked a little dirty. Shooters just tasted like ketchup.
0,"This place is awful.  The pizza is not good, but what is worse is the people who run the place.  They screwed up my order and refused to fix it.  I told them I was going to throw it away and order from somewhere else.  And I did.  Its really too bad, they are super close to my apartment. If they would've just been nice and switched it, I'd probably order from them again just based on that alone."

I'm upset and offended. I run my own business... and promote local business's constantly. I will be very sure to let everyone know this Pizza Parma.. believes the customer is not only not right, but their health doesn't matter.  What a bummer. I used to be a big fan."
0,"Looking for a quick bite to eat and a local told me this was \""the best pizza in the city.\""  I got a plain slice and a pepperoni slice. Possibly the worst pizza I have ever eaten.  This wouldn't even qualify as pizza in North Jersey.  I ate half of the plain slice because I was starving....then threw both in the garbage.  \n\nIf this is really the best pizza in Pittsburgh... wow."
0,"Zero stars. Came in 10 mins before close. Female manager on duty asked for $100 in exchange for a pizza. When we refused she said she could not serve us because her employees had been working since 9am..,it is currently 2:00 am... Sounds pretty illegal to me"
0,Horrible staff! Terrible attitude and we could tell didn't want to be there.  Screwed up our bill and was visible aggravated and angry when we questioned charges.  This awful service makes us never want to return.
0,"For the first time in my life, I sent my meal back to the kitchen. The Corn Beef in the Corn Beef and Cabbage tasted really bad and felt like I was chewing gum. Avoid that plate at all costs"
0,"There's a reason why this place has no reviews.  It's never open...not even at 6:30 pm on a Thursday.  Even though the sign said \""Open\"" and the door was open.  I guess I was supposed to know that it was closed.  But all I got was two people screaming in my ear that it was closed like I barely understood or something.  So much for customer service.  Needless to say, I probably won't be back."
0,"This was the single worst Thai meal I have ever had in my life.\n\nI went here for dinner with some friends after going to the PSO, since they were open relatively late at night.  This proved to have been a massive error in judgement on all our parts.\n\nThe first thing I ordered was a bowl of lemongrass soup.  The listing of ingredients made it seem like it should be tom yum soup, which is one of my favorite soups.  What I received was a bowl of dishwater-colored broth containing tomatoes, so that it tasted like watered-down minestrone, with some chicken submerged in shame at the bottom of the bowl.  A single lonely wilted leaf of cilantro wallowed on top.  No lemongrass was in evidence, but there were plenty of mushrooms.  I stopped eating this when I unearthed an unsightly artifact which turned out to be the bottom of a mushroom stem, with dirt still clinging to it.\n\nMy companions both got chicken and stir-fried vegetables in what turned out to be Singapore curry sauce.  This was passable, but not exciting -- again, although it claimed to be lemongrassy, there was no lemongrass flavor to be had, and the chicken was a bit rubbery and overdone.\n\nI got one of the fish entrees.  On the menu, the description made out like it was covered in a spicy sauce.  It turned out to be more like a not-at-all-spicy soup with bits of orange roughy floating in it.  Again, the broth was lacking in overall flavor, as if they were trying to save on costs by not adding enough spices.  The fish itself was at least not overcooked or dirty, but it was a poor aesthetic decision to bread and fry the piece of fish, then put the breaded coating into soup.  Gross.\n\nTo top it off, the service wasn't that great, and we were actually charged for the dirt-filled soup.  We will not be back."
0,"terrible service is right.  the minute my coworker and i walked in, the host (i think the teenage son of the owner?) was just rude.  he was going to give us the table closest to the register where people are always walking in and out.  my coworker asked to be seated at one of the other 8 tables that were open.  he mumbled something, but then let us grab another table.  and when he served the dishes he pretty much was throwing them onto the table.\n\nthe wonton soup was horrible.  the wonton itself was pretty much all dough (not even cooked all the way thru) and i don't even want to speculate what the tiny meat in it was made of.  i've also tried the house soup which is just water with tomotoes in it.  for my entree i had the green curry w/chicken, which actually wasn't as bad as the service but that's not saying much at all.\n\nsad that this is one of the few places for asian food in the pitts..."
0,Waiter was awful and food (pad thai) was not much better. Apparently letting the waiter know that your soda is flat (twice) is a huge inconvenience to him.
0,"This is by far the worst Thai restaurant I've ever been to. The servers are rude and slow, and the food is awful. Everything pretty much looks and tastes the same. The waiter seemed annoyed that my eating partner complained that his soda was flat, and brought him another flat soda. When he complained again, the waiter told him to see the host on the way out.  If you are in the area, there are many better choices for a good meal, other than this place."

0,"This restaurant has never been great, but if you wanted an Asian restaurant in the Cultural District it was an OK place to go. However, last night's dinner was just plain bad. I had beef salad, and it was some coolish beef on iceberg lettuce with sliced onions and a totally forgetful sauce. Nothing like the mix of sweet, sour, and spice that it should have. I also had tofu panang. It was also virtually tasteless. Some coconut milk flavoring in otherwise nondescript brown sauce with no spiciness."
0,"A very lovely name for a very terrible resturant. \n\nThe food is bland, bland bland. How this place can serve such flavorless food and stay open for years is beyond me. \n\nThe inside of the resturant is cramped and poorly maintained. \n\nI decided  to play it safe and ordered the broccoli in garlic sauce. The sauce was slimy and the broccoli was water logged and over cooked.  As if it has set in a pot of luck warm water for hours before being served to me. \n\nI'm noticing a theme of horrible resturants on 6th Street and I don't like it."
0,"Don't waste your time or money. Rude service, and pizza was subpar.  So many better options right around. Please dont cut corners on quality of your product.   The bar looked small and quaint. ..maybe the beer is really cold or I just hit a bad day.  For pizza? Na ...won't be back! NEXT!!!"

0,"I am not really certain how this place is getting the stellar reviews that it has. we just had a quick bite there last night and it was easily one of the worst meals that I have ever had the pleasure of paying for. While the people running the shop were lovely, it was not worth the $17 or so we paid.\n\nI had small cheese steak sub - asking only for mayo and lettuce. you would think that might be a nice time to let me know that they use some sort of house garlic-herb mayo instead of actual mayo. but no. So after a good bit of waiting my sub comes out with this weird speckly dressing on top of the lettuce... yes, this is that mayo - which is disgusting. I thought it was ranch and that is when he lady, with a smile, explained it was their house mayo... no, they don't use regular mayo here. \n\nso, let me tell you about this mayo:\n\n1. it is heavily flavored with garlic powder - which tastes seriously like chemicals on a good day and just should not be considered food in any way shape or form. Mixed in with this were some dried herbs - maybe an italian mix? who knows. all I could taste was the overwhelming chemical, fake garlic flavor. Hey, I love garlic and cook with it daily - mind you I actually use the real stuff. \n\n2. it is really thin... I mean thin like salad dressing, runny, thin. Um, isn't mayo supposed to be thick and spreadable? even the stuff you see at subway is thicker. this stuff tasted like really cheap, bad, ranch dressing.\n\nSo, after giving it a good effort to try to eat this \""sub\"" - I gave up and picked off the bread on the top of the sub - the bread was pretty stellar though. still hungry I decided to try to scrap off the mayo/lettuce disaster and go for the meat and cheese. um... salt? the meat, which suspiciously looked like those thin sheets of steak-um had zero flavor. one bite and I rejected it. While we are talking about the meat - why use this garbage? I am paying almost 6 bucks for this sub. I want to see yummy chopped up steak bits like you see at even a mall sub shop. not this grey, disgusting 1980s looking flavorless \""meat\"".  At least the bottom of the sub roll was salvageable... I ate the bread. \n\nOn to the pizza. My husband had two slices of pepperoni and my daughter had a slice of plain cheese. \n\nOk, pizza. well, this too was a massive disappointment. since I was still hungry after dumping the majority of my sub I tried both of their pizza slices. it reminded me of a nice store-bought frozen pizza. yes, bland. bad sauce with flavorless cheese. \n\nMy husband is a freak for pepperoni pizza and of the two slices he almost finished one of them. yes, more for the garbage. My daughter? she is three.. she isn't really a foodie (yet) but she got thru some of her cheese pizza... she actually spit some of it out but to be fair - she is three. I tried her pizza and honestly, all I could manage to somewhat enjoy was the crust which was nothing to rave about but it was tolerable. \n\nTo provide a baseline - we typically order from Rialto's and while they are not terrible they decent enough for a sub shop - pizza place.  this place... ugh. never. again. ever. We ended up throwing out about 80% of what we paid for. This place insults their customers with sub-par, dated, poor quality food."

0,"Honestly, the hoagies are fantastic, but their service is appalling. I ordered two hoagies and received one and a half. After calling and explaining the situation, Aaron, the \""manager\"", rationalized that their hoagies are large and could send another half \""depends on how hungry you are\"". ARE YOU SERIOUS?! I have never in my life heard of such asinine customer service. The girl on the phone was really nice though...if that counts for anything. They just lost a loyal customer...never again."
0,"They get 1 star because less was not an option. Was told by someone at the hospital that the steak hoagies are great. Well either our opinions differ greatly on food or we just got hosed. Looked up the menu online. $9.00 for a lrg Angelo special. Think philly cheese steak. So I ordered 2 for myself and my gf. I asked for mine with well done peppers onions and mushrooms no lettuce or tomato. I get there and the total is over $24! So I ask why. I'm told \""oh yeah that's the owners fault he doesn't want to update the online website so it's a little out of date.\"" A LITTLE!?!?? Two and a half dollars more is not a little. So I leave already feeling taken but hey they are big and they feel heavy so I'm still optimistic. WRONG AGAIN! The sandwiches nearly fell out through the grease soaked bag and found my sandwich covered in grease swimming lettuce and tomatoes with pale mushrooms and uncooked peppers. Swimming I tell you swimming in grease! If I have a heart atack I'll know why. Called to complain and was pretty much told it was my fault they became greasy because I took to long to get there! And that its all the owners fault about the price. Poor food poor excuses and apparently poor ownership. The next thing that should be poor is the owner because I will NEVER eat there again."
0,"I ordered a Veggie Pizza with 4 different toppings and did not really enjoy it a lot. They use some oil which smell different that killed the taste of my pizza. Also, the toppings were not greatly blended, just rather sprinkled. DIdn't even enjoy the pizza crust.\nI work right next door, but wont go there again.\nI usually dont write reviews. Was surprised Yelp had 4 stars and I was disaoopinted, so writing my experience.So sharing my input that may help others make an uinformed choice causeI think 4 stars is misleading."

0,"I am disappointed.  I have lived in the neighborhood for over 6 years and I keep giving them a second chance (and a third).  The take out menu says in big letter on the front 15% off take out.  So we ordered again, although we generally get poor service and the food is average at best.  \n\nThis time we ordered 2 entrees and and a few sides.  When I went to pick up the order they had given us 15% off ONE ENTREE.  So it was no discount at all.  When you mention something to them about poorly worded menu and the principle of false advertising they argue with you.  \n\nSo we are done with them, no more peoples we will drive down to Taste of India from now on."
0,"Hadn't been here in a few years and remembered I enjoyed it in undergrad, especially for late night half off. Called in advance to make sure they were open until 10 and had half off like they used to. The woman who answered the phone said yes to both so I rushed over. The portions were small, but I assumed it was because it was half price so I shrugged it off. The tomato sauce was chunky and generic, the raita side dish was 4 spoonfuls big, and the chutney dips were cold and bland. Assuming this was due to the discount, I didn't complain. Receive my check to find out it was all full price. Despite the woman telling me on the phone that it was half off, it was buy one get one half off. The woman on the phone was the same as the hostess. She admitted it was she who answered yet refused to accommodate her mistake. I don't normally feel compelled to complain but that is ridiculous. A subpar meal and subpar service in addition to false marketing. Never going back despite the fond memories I had accumulated when in school. Completely ridiculous."
0,"Maybe I went on a bad day but the food was pretty darn terrible. The spring rolls were falling apart and only filled with noodles and a couple of sad looking shrimp, no thai basil or mint leaves or cilantro to speak of. I also got some crispy noodles with seafood which I only ate because I had been sitting on a train for 9 hours and was starving. And the whole thing was seriously overpriced for Pittsburgh, New York prices for extremely subpar vietnamese, meh."
0,"A local friend who considers Dr. Bebko an extraordinarily good vet checked and was told Dr. Bebko did consult with other out of area vets and would be happy to do that with my vet on behalf of my very sick kitty, but the cat's records would need to be faxed to him. \n\nMy vet's office, here in Texas,  did so, and because the chest x-rays could only be sent via e-mail she called Dr. Bebko's office. She was told that Dr. Bebko did NO consultations regarding an animal he had not personally seen.  He added that she (my vet tech) was wasting his and her time, that Dr. Bebko would NOT be looking at the faxed information., and not to bother with the x-rays.  (Since my cat has a collapsed lung, records without x-rays are pretty useless.) \n\nWhen I reported this to my friend who had spoken so highly of Dr. Bebko, she called his office and was told the exact opposite...  Maybe the doctor IS good, but I'll never know because his office is either certifiably crazy or incredibly rude...maybe both. \n\n And, yes, of course there are feline specialists right here in Texas, but I wanted THIS particular doctor because of my friend's recommendation."
0,"Wow!  Talk about attitude on the phone!  After all the glowing reviews that I read on-line, I decided to call this place and schedule and appointment for my cat who has been having issues lately.  Due to my work schedule, I requested a Saturday appointment but was told that they don't take new clients on Saturdays.  When I explained my situation, I was told that those were the rules of the clinic and that there were no exceptions.  I asked about late hours but the latest appointment is at 6 PM.  I work until 6PM.  I asked about early morning appointments but was told that they begin see patients at 10 AM.  I start work at 9 AM.  I was then told that I should take a day off to bring the cat in for an exam.  When I expressed my frustration, I was told, \""Well, I'm sorry.  We reserve our Saturdays for existing clients only.\"" I replied that I would have been a client if they were willing to accommodate me.  I got a snippy, \""Well, I'm sorry.\""  Never mind!  I don't need to receive attitude from a receptionist.  Clearly, they don't  need my business."

0,The bar reeks of smoke and the bar table feels sticky. You'll definitely feel like you're in the deepest hole in the way. The only good thing is that the drinks are cheap. But I really wouldn't recommend going there.
0,"Yes, the fish was good. However, the restaurant was dirty, the bathroom smelled so awful that I could not go in it. The waitress was RUDE, CRUDE, and downright  OBNOXIOUS!!!!  Was the fish good enough for me to ever go back - NEVER!!!!!!!!"
0,"I tried to eat here tonight using a $25 gift certificate purchased from Restaurant.com.  After waiting over 15 minutes for my server to stop by for my order, I showed her my gift certificate.  She told me they stopped taking them, however I had just purchased it 15 minutes earlier.  \n\nI spoke to the manager and he wasn't the least bit interested.  He told me Restaurant.com was a scam (I have used it before with no problems) and he hasn't been able to get in touch with them to cancel.  While I was still talking to him, he answered a call on his cell phone without even saying excuse me.  He obviously didn't care at all.\n\nI called Restaurant.com for a refund, and told them what he said.  They told me that they have actually been trying to get in touch with the restaurant for weeks.  I can only assume he owes them money or something.  Either way, it is outrageous that he will not honor a gift certificate for a program he agreed to sign up for.\n\nBeyond this problem, I can't recommend this place simply based on how awfully they dealt with this issue.  I didn't get a chance to try any food and I never will."
0,"This will be simple...\nThe karaoke had a very limited selection. \nThe DJ kept fiddling with the volume while you were singing. \nWas way over-crowded with wanna-be hipsters who were attempting to be ironic which just made them look pathetic, especially since they kept taking pictures to most likely show Facebook people how much fun they were having and how great they are.\nThere was only one server for a bar packed with people and was hard to get a drink.\n\nWon't be going back."
0,Pay attention to the bill.\n\nCurly haired male bartender intentionally added $20 of drinks to my tab. When I confronted him he blamed the extra drinks on my friends who hadn't been drinking those things in the first place.
0,"I was walking my small granddaughter (not yet two) and when I passed I decided to go in to pick up some shrimp for my son.  I waited quite a bit of time in line for the shrimp, then again to check out.  When I checked out the woman at the register told me that they did not accept cards for purchases under $5 and since I had no money with me I told her I couldn't get the shrimp.  THERE IS NO SIGN ON THE DOOR STATING THIS OR I WOULD NOT HAVE WASTED MY TIME OR MY GRANDCHILD'S IMPATIENCE GETTING THE PRODUCT.  PUT A SIGN ON THE DOOR SO PEOPLE CAN EITHER PASS BY YOUR STORE OR GO TO THE BANK ATM PRIOR TO ENTERING.  I will not be back (the woman was rude).  I have been there before, making much larger purchases, but never have been aware of the restriction.  PUT A SIGN ON YOUR DOOR WHEN THERE ARE STORE CONDITIONS I LOOKED FOR ONE ON ENTERING.  Restrictions are understandable, just not when you fail to publish them and I waste my time."
0,"I *used* to think Donatelli's was a great place--they're incredibly cheap, the premade foods like crab raviolis are delicious, and they have awesome chocolate covered pretzels and biscotti.\nThen I saw one of the deli members drop meat on the floor, pick it up, and stick it right back in the case! Also, a whole tray of meatballs and sauce from the hot bar was spilled all over the floor. They just scooped it right back in and I only hope it wasn't served! The place smells awful and the workers are grumpy. There's a lady there who's always screaming and cursing and some fat guy that's just as bad. The LAST experience I had with Donatelli's was when I bought a tub of \""freshly packed\"" soynuts. I got home, cracked a brew, and reached into my beer snack to find a WORM!!! If you value your health as I do, do not eat anything from Donatelli's that  was packed there."
0,"Jane is so right. The food and prices may be great, but who wants to eat dirt with it? I've seen someone mop the filthy snow tracked floor then put the bucket of water on the deli counter. No thanks. I'll pay a little more for sanitation. There are other Italian grocery stores close by."
0,"I RUSHED to tan today after work. I got to Yolanda's at 7:20PM, only to find that the salon was closed. Both the sign on the door and the listed hours on the website state that Yolanda's tanning side is open until 8pm. I'm pretty pissed that I wasted time driving the whole way from Monroeville to Bloomfield for nothing. I've spent money on (multiple) tanning packages here, but I will definitely be taking my sad, untanned booty somewhere more reliable from now on."
0,"If you have been to any other PHO restaurant, in any other city, Tram's Kitchen would be OUT OF BUSINESS! \n\nFor starters, the portion of the PHO is extremely SKIMPY! I don't think we have had such a small portion of PHO since we were Babies! Seriously, would it kill you to add more rice noodles? \n\nSince we had the PHO as our Appetizers, we then ordered the Seafood Pan Fried Noodles...Oh wait...we paid for Seafood...but all we got were vegetables and some imitation they call seafood. What a Joke! \n\nSuggestion if you plan on going here. Come FULL and just order the Spring Roll."
0,"I didn't care too much for the atmosphere because most hole in the wall sort of restaurant are authentic & non-Americanized (which is what I'm looking for).  Location of the restaurant was in a run down (kind of Old Pittsburgh style) and parallel parking was a must, be aware that you may have to park far and walk to the restaurant if you're not able to get front door service.  Inside I didn't expect much, tablecloths were vinyl and chairs with uneven stands.  All I care about was the authenticity of the food & cost for what it's worth.\n\nI started my meal with an appetizer of Goi Cuon with shrimp.  I was highly disappointing when disecting what was in it.  There was 1 shrimp cut in half lengthwise, mainly bun (rice noodle) for fillers along with a few strands of beansprouts & lettuce to make it look presentable.  I quickly devoured the tiny appetizer in 2 bites.  My main entree was Pho Ha Noi.  It took forever for the food to arrive, it was a big bowl.  Until I stirred it around to find out it was mainly broth and green onions.  The broth was flavorless, actually it didn't have any flavor; so I had to add hoisin sause to give it a little of whatever to go along with the sliced pork.  I was confused about the noodle itself, Pho is usually served with flat vermicelli noodle; but this Pho Ha Noi was served with round vermicelli noodles usually for Bun Bo entree.  I asked the old man with the amputated arm, why it was served with bun (round rice noodle) instead of pho (flat rice noodle) noodles, he laughed and insisted it was pho (flat rice noodle).  Ok I may be young but I wasnt born yesterday, I think I know my pho noodle and sorry it wasn't.  \n\nNext visit to the 'burgh, I think I'll try Pho Minh & see how their PHO compares to Tram's Kitchen.  So HIGHLY disappointed with my Pho experience."
0,"I've been to Tram's several times, always hoping for a better experience, and more importantly, better food.  I eventually gave up.  The food tends to be bland, the owner brusque, and with Pho Minh just up the street, I find myself going there when I'm craving a hot bowl of pho on a cold Pittsburgh winter night.\n\nFood highlights - \n   None that I can really think of.  The food is cheap.\n\nFood cons - \n   The component that makes or breaks a bowl of pho is the broth.  It is the one thing that must be good for the soup to be enjoyable.  I've never had any hint of real flavor from the broth itself (before you add the plum sauce and the srirachia and basil and lime).  This is something that Tram's has gotten badly wrong every time I visited."
0,"Went here last weekend with friends. Two of us became violently ill with food poisoning. Ordinarily, I would recommend the spring rolls and the pho, of course, but since my trip to the ER, I won't be back here again."
0,"First of all, Tram's has been cited by the Allegheny Health Department for code violations like not storing meat at proper temperatures. I also personally know several people who have gotten violently ill from eating there. If that's not enough to stop you, read on.\n\nI feel like people who like this place are confusing \""dirty & mean\"" with authentic. The staff are unpleasant and it doesn't feel like a place you'd want someone cooking food. \n\nAnd finally, sure, all of this could be different if the food was good, but in my opinion, it is not. Bland and disappointing, the Pho most of all. Pittsburgh has so many great asian restaurants, including other Vietnamese options, that I don't see any reason to eat here."
0,"I've only been here after 2 AM, and it's always been a flaming trainwreck of an experience.\n\nI've had to figure out if the waitresses were doing this as a halfway house job, I've had staff members not apologize while picking pieces of steel wool and green plastic scrubber out of my food, and I've witnessed an armed robbery.  The food is decent, for the hours they're open.  \n\nTry Tom's Diner or Eat 'n Park instead.  Heck, go to a grocery store instead."
0,"Worst food in Pittsburgh. That's all. I have been there twice, never my choice, I had tummy ache both times. I think the food is boring. Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with non-gourmet food, but Ritter's, is just \""blah\"". It also was an unclean feel at times when you are seated and you look around. \nThey are cash only also. That doesn't both me at Pamelas, because the food is oh so delish. Here, you are just wasting you apetite on food that has TONS of rooms for improvement."
0,"I live off of Liberty Ave and everyone kept telling me I needed to try this place, so after 4 months I did.  When my wife and I walked in I thought, this place doesn't look too bad, actually kinda cool.  WRONG!  After being seated it probably took 5 minutes for the waitress to come over and another 5 minutes for our coffee to get to the table.  Our food took about 45 minutes, which is absolutely ridiculous for standard breakfast, but I though, everyone thinks this place is great, I guess I can wait for perfection. \n\nThe food gets to our table, it looks good, it looks like breakfast, but it is cold, well mine was cold.  So I'm sitting at the table, empty coffee, cold breakfast and quite pissed off, because of the situation and I'm hungry.  Finally after about 10-12 minutes the waitress comes by and asks how everything is, I tell her my food is cold, and I'm fine and don't need another plate, we had already been there over an hour, we had placed to go, ya know.\n\nWhen the waitress brings the bill over she doesn't just tell me she took my food off, she says, I figured I would take the food off even though you didn't ask (really?  should I have to?).\n\nWife's food was hot, but she thought it to be just average breakfast.\n\nI never want to go back, but I will, because I always give places another shot.\n\nTerribly slow service (server was very nice though, probably home from college), and food took forever.  I doubt this place puts out cold food on a regular basis, because this place wouldn't be so packed and highly regarded."
0,"This was some of the worst food I've ever had.  If this is someone's idea of nostalgia, nostalgia is a term I'd like to forget, and the reality is more like nausea.  Their greek soup (tasted like Campbell's chicken noodle flavored with lemon) and nasty lamb gyro douched with cucumber dressing will likely haunt me as long as I live.  For anyone looking for a good nostalgic diner experience, i can't make a recommendation because I've yet to experience one, but at least in this case, leave the past where it belongs."
0,"People call it \""Critters\"" for a reason.\n\nThe two times I've been there I was unhappy.  It's cheap, but the food is also gross and you don't get much of it (thank goodness!).  Very small toast, cold hard pancakes, and adequate dippy eggs was what I received last time I went.  \n\nOh, cash only too."
0,"Ummm, we're pretty sure my boyfriend got food poisoning here. That was the last thing we had eaten for hours, and the next morning he DEFINITELY had eaten something bad after waking up... yikes."
0,"Don't get me wrong, the foods great, but when there's only a handful of booths full it shouldn't take an hour and a half to get breakfast. If you get to the point that you'd rather leave and go to McDonalds just so you can eat something it's too long of a wait."
0,How does this place even stay in business. It's disgusting. The food is crap. Everything is filthy. All the waitresses look like crackheads. They screwed up a club sandwich & fries. How is that even possible?  It deserves negative stars for sucking so badly.
0,"I took my family of 7 here on sunday 11/9. We arrived at 11AM and by 1:20 we had not received our food. This is after ordering over and hour ago. We noticed the table around us received their food even though they had been seated after us. The waitress was very nice and said she was sorry for the wait several times. I finally asked to see the mgr, who I assume is the owner. He finally came to our table and after I explained the situation to him all he did was said that he really cares about his customers and if he made all his customers wait this way he wouldn't have any customers then he walked away. He did nothing to compensate us for the long wait. I go here because it is convenient for everyone. The food is just so so. Well this will be my last visit. I understand everyone can have a slip up but it is how they handle it to make the customer feel better. Ritters gets a Failing Grade in this category and an OK for the food."

0,"Never been treated so poorly\n\nI went with three friends to eat at Tessaro's on a rainy Saturday evening.  I dropped them off while I parked the car.  The hostess  sat them and when she found out I was parking the car, she told them literally to \""GET UP.\""  She said they wouldn't seat them because I wasn't there.  By that time I had arrived at the table  my friends were still in shock by the utter rudeness.  Tessaro's was a Pittsburgh institution that my family had frequented for years.  Our treatment is a disgrace to its reputation"
0,"my burger was really dry and tasteless, and I ordered it to be cooked medium. I was disappointed in this place because everyone says its the best burger in town...I must be missing something. I thought the atmosphere kinda sucks and the way seating is done leaves much to be desired...overall might go back to see if it was just a fluke, but wont be rushing there."
0,"This was my first and last time at this restaurant. I thought Tessaro's was some sort of Pittsburgh landmark and I've heard rave reviews of their burgers. The burger I got was undercooked. I ordered it well done and it was definitely pink in the middle. But I didn't send it back because I never send anything back. I just ate it and it was a sloppy, greasy mess. The bread was cheap and tasteless. The home fries were just diced potatoes. That burger sat clogged in my stomach for 3 or 4 hours. And I had to make a few runs to the bathroom because I thought I was going to make a mess in my pants. Burger king is a lot better than this place and at a fraction of the cost. What else you got Pittsburgh? This better not be the best you got."
0,"This is the only burger place I have ever been to that doesn't serve french fries. WTF? Went once, only due to bad weather, and would never go again."
0,"We came for steaks. Mistake. Probably great burgers (if you read the reviews), but that's it. They don't know how to cook steaks unless you like hockey pucks. They also have a wind problem every time the front door is open. Finally, a supposed owner that works as hostess needs to concentrate on her job and learn how a restaurant is run. We won't go back."
0,"Horrible Food, Horrendous Customer Service, #overrated\n\nSo I already wasted 2 hours of my life eating at this place, so I am not going to write a thesis as to why someone should not be a patron of this restaurant.  In summation, when we arrived we were harassed by the owner (acting as the hostess) for wanting to sit in the corner, served flat beer, and then interrogated by her after sending an order back for not meeting the clear specifications given to the waitress.  Living in Latin America and traveling in Asia for some time, I have been to a lot of hellholes, but this is hands down the worst place I have ever been.  Not only was the food lousy and way overpriced, but we were hassled by the belligerent, sarcastic, and condescending owner almost the entire time. Clearly, customer service nor quality of food are valued.  Honestly, I would rather starve than eat here again."
0,"i went to this restaurant saturday for the first time. my fiance and i went with a couple who live in bloomfield and go to this restaurant every two weeks or so. We walked in and there were already some people waiting for a table. We stood near the host area for 10 minutes. Several employees including the host walked passed us over a dozen times and never said anything to us. Finally my friend asked how long the wait for a table would be. The host looked at us rudely and said \""I don't know, 20 to 30 minutes.\"" He was so rude and huffy. We left because of how unhelpful the staff was. I was excited about dining at this place before 10 minutes of frustration. We left immediately and went to the Thia restaurant down the street. It was excellent and they actually valued us as customers."
0,"Wow! If I could give negative stars I certainly would for this place. I wanted it to be decent because they have an ok draught selection and seating outside in the summer. That is where the positive qualities end. Food tasted like it came from a microwave - but that is actually generous, probably actually came from Fido's dog bowl. This is an excellent candidate for kitchen nightmares, the place looks straight out of the 80's and not in a cool hipster way either."
0,"Growing up in pittsburgh I heard a lot of good things about this place but it must have gone down hill over the years. \n\nFirst off the area we were sat in was anything but a place you would go for a nice dinner, with a giant TV and no table clothes it basically felt like your typical bar restaurant. Including a few flys to annoy you.\n\nWe were served by a waitress who was generally not interested in waiting on us, sitting us down handing us a paper and said here is our specials, and walked away. She also was singing have the time walking around and mumbling to herself.\n\nI could deal with that if the food was good but it was far from it, I ordered and itialian platter that had a piece of lasagna that had parts that were hard as a brick and clearly seemed microwaved. Then it had a portion of chicken parm and the chicken was paper thin and again hard and dried out.\n\nMy gf ordered the Chicken Romano and it eh alright, it was kinda soggy, not the best but not the worst for her order.\n\nfor what you pay and what you get, just avoid it, not worth trying, over priced and just bad food."
0,Well to be honest this was one of the worst dinning experiences of my eating career. We sat outside and the service was VERY SLOW. Then my purse gets stolen right from my hand by what I can only describe as a gang of thugs. As if that wasn't bad enough the slow wait staff took about ten minutes to call the police and then proceeded to charge us for our mediocre meals even as they saw me telling the police how my wallet had been stolen under the waitstaffs not so watchful eye. Save your money and your wallet and go to wendy's the quality is far superior to this place.
0,"Despicable service at the bar, very selective about who they serve, and incredibly rude when you request service after they ignore you for 20 minutes."
0,"Some friends and I were here Friday, August 22nd. It was very crowded due to Little Italy Days in Bloomfield. I didn't mind waiting 45 minutes for a table as it was busy, but they seemed understaffed which is unacceptable. \n\nOnce we were seated, we waited 15 minutes for our waitress Misty to greet us and take our drink orders. She complained about how busy they were and how this was the second double in a row she was working. She told us she was thinking of getting wasted that night and coming in the next day hungover... I can not stand when waitresses/waiters see that we're younger (I'm 25, my friends are in their early 30s) and assume that they can drop all professionalism and talk to us like we're their friends. I sympathize with you being slammed but I don't want to hear you complaining nor do I want to hear about you getting wasted. We should have requested another waitress at that moment.\n\nTwo other tables who were seated 10-15 minutes after us got their food about 20 minutes before us. Two other waitresses were working the room and seemed fast and competent. We were the only table with Misty, who was working both the bar area and us. She never checked on us, took forever to get our food to us (which I'm assuming was sitting back in the kitchen for quite some time) and after we finished, we sat there for 20 minutes before we finally flagged down the hostess for our check. From the time we walked in to the time we walked out was about 2 hours. Would never consider going back.\n\nThe food was good."
0,This place does not have good italian sauce it tasted like chef boyardee and my crab cakes were not cooked in the middle it was cold. I wont be back.
0,"I have been coming here for years. The doctor was always great and the receptionist was super helpful and sweet. They recently got a new receptionist, I had called about ordering some contacts. She tells me my prescription was not good as i hadn't had an exam in over two years. I had been in earlier that year for an exam and also some contacts so i was confused. \n\nShe tells me that it was just for contacts and that I wasn't charged for an actual exam so no biggie, but the big deal is that days earlier i had ordered 4 new pairs of glasses with the wrong prescription and also i had gone over a year with a bad prescription. It's unfortunate because i had gone in for an eye exam, been told i was getting one, was written a prescription i used to purchase glasses the last year or so. \n\nI guess that may explain my recent headaches. \n\nThen when I tried to talk to her about it, i was given nothing but yelling and rude comments. I had a repor with the other receptionist and didn't know she had left. So when i asked where she went, as she had been there for many years. She said \""she probably left having to deal with rude people like me\"". I was just shocked at the way i was treated, she was talking over me, telling me that I was done talking, and it was late and i had said enough and she didn't care. it went on and on, she was actually yelling at me! And i hadn't even been upset, just trying to say... hey man this sucks what happened, are you guys gonna reimburse me for all the wrong glasses i just ordered? actually check my vision, I was hung up on before i could come up with any resolve.\n\nsad, but never again"
0,"Captain's Log Stardate: Circa 2004 - 2006-ish... I lived about an hour and a half outside of the city. Coming here was usually pretty exciting. (Here as in the city, not Silky's.) I had a friend who lived here in the East End and on the street I reside on now. \n\nSeveral times we found ourselves at Silky's Pub. I love the corner building, the way it looks out onto Liberty Ave. It looks so welcoming. Especially in the summer. Outdoor seating, always pretty well packed with people.\n\nI'll come right out and say that the crowd that frequents Silky's isn't my usual crowd, but unlike some bars I'd never had an issue with someone wanting to start a fight with us because we look like a bunch of dirty malcontents. This place is just not our usual dive bar.\n\nThursday night my boyfriend texted me that he was there with a mutual friend. Living less than a city block from there I headed over. I needed a beer and some hockey/world series action to distract me after the Halloween parade. It was as busy as usual. A few seats remaining and I managed to snag one right at the bar, front and center.\n\nI hate to say this because I don't remember this happening years ago when I went there. I was not even acknowledged. I get flagging down a bartender in a crazy busy bar in the South Side on a Friday night. I don't like it but I get it. This was a moderately steady Thursday night. I wasn't standing behind the people's sitting at the bar. I was the person sitting at the bar. There were two male bartenders both bartenders asked the guy next to me multiple times if he wanted anything else to drink. \n\nBy \""multiple times\"" I mean 6 or 8 times. The person sitting directly beside me. They wouldn't look at me. I tried to make eye contact with either of them and it was as if I wasn't even there. Eventually the boyfriend's beer emptied as well. This is about 20 minutes after I arrived. I've had people walk in and stand behind us and the bar tender or waitress was on them immediately. After another 5 minutes of the boyfriend's beer being perched precariously on the edge of the bar and the bartenders standing there chatting he had to ask the bartender for a refill and if I could have a drink.\n\nThe bartender looks up at him, grabs his pint glass angrily from the bar and says, \""Oh, you wanted another?\"" \n\nReally? I was so angry at that point that it took everything I had not to ask the guy what his issue was.  I later saw him drop a pint glass and stumble into something so many he was drunk.\n\nThe food that other people ordered smelled and looked great. Even the seafoody bits which I normally hate smelling. The tv's are plentiful and newer. I just don't know if I'll ever get to go back and try the food as I hate being slighted by a business owner and treated as if my business isn't appreciated."

Unlike fox news I try to give a fair and balanced review based on my personal experience with a business.\n\nI returned to jiffylube on 12/23/11 to get an oil change. No problems with my oil change. They managed to have the oil changed in under 10 minutes.\n\nHowever the guys were fumbling around with the latch on my hood for several minutes. I stuck head out the door to tell the guys to push the hood button back in then close the hood. I was ignored.The situation should have been handled differently.\n\n1) Before attempting to \""fix\"" my hood latch they should have called me out there and asked how would I go about closing my hood.\n2) explained that my car hood did not close properly\n3) they should have explained to me the potential dangers of my hood not closing properly. Because on 12/24/11 my car hood came up while I was driving on highway. I narrowly avoided a serious accident"
0,$400 IN DAMAGES\n\nThey cracked my oil pan and it cost me four hundred dollars to repair. Everything was fine before I brought it here. Mechanic said it looked like they put my bolt in crooked and then hammered it in. Avoid at all cost. They will ruin your car.
0,"Never go to this Jiffy Lube.  They tried to charge me $45 for an oil change- no way! I just asked them to change my headlight bulb, and it took an hour and a half.  They kept taking other peoples car who had come in after me, probably because they weren't making much money off of me.  It took them at least a half hour to actually change the bulb- I looked over and 4 people were under the hood trying to figure it out.  Clearly they have no idea what they are doing because last time I needed this service it was done in 5 minutes.  All of the employees were rude and had an attitude.  I would NEVER go back or recommend this place to anyone!"
0,"Terrible experience. I dropped my car off at 9:25 AM on a Saturday and there was one other person in front of me. I didn't leave until 11:05AM and was charged $99 for a synthetic oil changed. Overpriced, terrible customer service, and long wait times. Never coming back here."
0,"I went to jiffy lube for a routine oil change. I waited for an hour and a half, but they were busy, so I understood.  However, as I was driving home my check engine light came on (within 5 minutes of me leaving jiffy lube). I pulled over and read my car manual and it said that it meant there was an emissions problem.  I knew that the jiffy lube guys had taken my air filter out, so I figured they had probably failed to reconnect everything properly. I turned around and went back to jiffy lube. However, when I got there and explained my situation, I was told it would be another 2 hour wait before they could help me. After some back and forth, they called over the manager.  He basically denied any possibility that it could be related to anything they had done, and tried to tell me that my car just happened, coincidentally, to be having some other problem. Finally, he agreed to let me pull up front and hook my car up to the diagnostic machine. They got back a vague error code (p0420 - catalytic efficiency below threshold), denied any responsibility, and sent me on my way. I'm down $50 and still don't know what's wrong with my car.  All I wanted was a simple oil change!!!! I will never, ever go back to a jiffly lube - especially not this one."
0,"Very bad service. They are extremely slow. I waited 90 minutes even though there were just 2 cars in front of me. I bought the signature service which includes vacuuming which they didn't do at all. When I told them that, they just lied and said they did. Never going back here!"
0,"Go there only if you want served uncooked fish, odd tasting salad, or way too sweet tea (btw - no unsweetened)."
0,"My husband and I visited on a quiet Friday afternoon, and we were politely greeted by the bartender. We each ordered a beer and were promptly served. After taking a moment to glance over the menu, we decided on the pita pizza app, the special (beer battered fish/Mac and cheese) and the fish tacos. \nThe pita pizza: a soft pita shell with pesto, tomatoes, chicken and cheese. BORING. \nThis appetizer reminded me of my mother's Irish cooking: tasteless. A simple addition of caramelized onions would have solved this problem. \nEntree 1: Beer battered fish and Mac and cheese. Ruling: BLAND. My husband ordered this one and described the fish as \""wet\"" and the Mac and cheese as \""play-doh\"". They also served the dish with lettuce, tomato and onion, as if it were a sandwich. \nEntree 2: Fish tacos. Ruling: OVERCOOKED/COVER-UP ATTEMPTED. Ok, so they weren't bad, but the fish was dry. Covered with tomatoes and a bit of lettuce, the tacos were, again, on the tasteless side. The attempt at adding flavor came with the chipotle mayo and sour cream. \nThese only helped to moisten the fish. The corn relish was masked by jalape\u00f1o peppers and the rice came shaped as if out of a small flowerpot.\nThe service was quite friendly, so, no fault there. The chef, however, needs a bit of training."
0,"This place has the worst french fries I have ever tasted. They were literally BLACK. All I tasted was burnt oil. My photo is the zucchini planks and that lump of blackness are the French fries that I was sent home with. I could not even eat one! I also ordered the zucchini planks and a grilled cheese on rye with bacon. The grilled cheese was incredibly dry and the cook put the bread together upside down, like it did not match up...One piece of bread was the opposite way than the other. Also the sandwich did not stick together like a melted sandwich should. Ugh. The zucchini planks were delicious. 1 out of 3 is not great. My sister raved about this place. I am so disappointed. Disgusting. DO NOT EAT HERE. I spent $30 for only one edible thing worth $4. So pissed!"
0,"I'm sorry, this place is simply not good. Unfortunately, it is yet another example of poorly made Americanized Italian food. Too much cheese, too much butter and cream, and quite possibly the worst bread I have ever consumed at any Italian restaurant in my life. \n\nSomeone had to go out of their way to find bread this flavorless and awful. It's already a travesty that it's served to me before the meal, but to put it on my sandwich! I'm actually offended for Italians, and bread. Yes bread, this is not your best. The eggplant Parmesan served to my mother was soggy, covered with an absurd amount of plastic Parmesan cheese swimming in a bland sauce. My fathers pasta, cream and cheese. Contrary to popular believe, this is not traditional Italian! This is what some would refer to as, terrible and heavy. And the cannoli? Words could not describe my disappointment.\n\nI'll admit it, I'm already an Italian food snob. I cook tons of Italian food for myself, family, and friends, and I only use the highest quality ingredients and go about preparing my meals in traditional southern Italian ways. I've had phenomenal Italian meals at the few great Italian restaurants in this city, so whenever I get the opportunity to eat at another \""Italian\"" joint, I'm heading in with high expectations.\n\nIs this what Italian food in Pittsburgh has come too? Seeing other similar Italian places in Bloomfield, I'm sad to say...yes. I'm actually slightly upset even writing this because the waitstaff is charming, and I hear the owners are great, but to pass this off as representative of Italian food is an injustice. If you want a truly great Italian meal please look elsewhere."
0,Not real Italian. When there's a crab dish on the menu and you don't let your customers know this there's a problem. Imitation crab meat at an Italian restaurant doesn't fly. I was hoping for some good Italian while out of town and was truly disappointed. The bar service was extremely friendly about my compliant and did remove that dish from my bill. My entree was pasta and shrimp. I haven't paid $20 for a dish of pasta and 5 large shrimp in a long time. Don't worry but I won't come close to this restaurant again.
0,"I've eaten at Alexander's for a decade, but, like Del's, it's becoming one of those places where the food gets worse every time you go there.  Today, half the lettuce I had on my Caesar salad was rotten.  I have no idea why it ever left the kitchen.  And it was take-out, too, so there wasn't much I could do about it after driving all the way home.  (They gave me the wrong entr\u00e9e too, but at least it was edible.)\n\nI finally think I'm done with this place."
0,"I AM BOYCOTTING ALEXANDER'S FOR LIFE!!! The manager SCREAMED AT ME at the top of his lungs in an epic meltdown that lasted 10 minutes! \n\nOn Sat., April 12, 2014, I attended the 50th birthday party for my dear friend, David Flynn. I organized the party, but relied on Dave and his sister to provide me with the final head count. I made the reservation for 25 people.\n\nThe manager and I played phone tag for the two days before the event. I called back and left messages TWICE to confirm, but apparently he never got my messages. (This was part of his rant, his indignation at unreturned phone calls that actually HAD been returned!)\n\nThe dinner started at 7 PM. Most of our group arrived on time, but some of our group (including me) arrived between 8 PM-9 PM. I was working on a homemade birthday present for Dave, which took longer than expected. I called Dave, his sister and my friends (Reesa & Joel) to tell them I was running late. In hindsight, I should have also called the restaurant to let them know, and for that I am truly sorry. That still doesn't justify the manager SCREAMING AT ME FOR 10 MINUTES!\n\nAfter enjoying a delicious dinner, drinks and birthday cake, none of us had a clue that anything was wrong. If the decision to return to a restaurant were based SOLELY on the food and wait staff, I would definitely return to Alexander's. But sadly, when the manager has a nuclear meltdown and throws a 10-MINUTE SCREAMING TEMPER TANTRUM, it tends to sour one on returning to a restaurant.\n\nTowards the end of our dinner, some of us started to smell cigarette smoke, which we later realized was coming from the patio out front. (It was a warm night, and they had the front sliding-glass doors open.) In the midst of the smoke discussion, the manager approached our table and began an EPIC RANT, SCREAMING AT ME FOR 10 MINUTES!!!\n\nHe was angry that everyone in our group hadn't arrived at exactly 7 PM. The restaurant's kitchen is open till 10 PM on Sat. night, so I don't understand why this was a big deal. We ended up with 20 people total and 5 no-shows. I am always disappointed by no-shows, but I explained this possibility to the manager when I made the reservation. I STILL BROUGHT HIM 20 PAYING CUSTOMERS! \n\nBTW...the dining room was practically EMPTY, which is not what I would expect on a Saturday night in Pittsburgh. Maybe I'm not the first customer to be on the receiving end of the manager's meltdown.\n\nThe manager SCREAMED that he had called me twice, and I hadn't called him back! He ranted about this about a dozen times. I told him I HAD called him back - TWICE. It's not my fault if he didn't get my messages. \n\nHe SCREAMED that he had put an extra waitress and cook on staff because he expected 25 people. He SCREAMED that I had cost the restaurant $100! How much money do you think 20 people spent on appetizers, dinner and drinks? I find it hard to believe that they didn't make any money, or at least break even. \n\nI am sorry that there were 5 no-shows in our group, but I always thought Saturday night was the busiest night of the week for most restaurants. I didn't realize the restaurant would look like a deserted, old western ghost town with hardly any customers. On a Saturday night, I assumed they would have a full staff on duty with or without my reservation. I was wrong. I'm sorry. I'm not perfect.\n\nThe manager also YELLED at me and my friends for \""LOOKING COMFORTABLE\"" in his restaurant!!! Since when is looking comfortable an OFFENSE??? I thought restaurants wanted you to feel comfortable, but apparently not at Alexander's.\n\nHe also SCREAMED that one of the waitresses only got a $1.00 tip! I found that hard to believe, but just in case he wasn't making it up, I tipped my waitress $35 on my $26 dinner check! I am a former waitress, and I would feel HORRIBLE if any waitress every got ripped off on my watch! Even if his story wasn't true, I figured she deserved an extra big tip just for having to WORK in such a horrible place where the manager YELLS at paying customers!!! If he treats the customers this way, I can only imagine how he treats the employees. \n\nTHE MANAGER'S RUDE BEHAVIOR HAS COST HIM MY BUSINESS AND MY FRIENDS' BUSINESS FOREVER!!! During his rant, he actually SCREAMED that he never wanted to see me in his restaurant ever again! I'm happy to grant him that wish. And so are my friends. \n\nThis is an example of the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I have ever witnessed in my entire life!!! I thought the manager was going to have a heart attack or a stroke the way he was SCREAMING FOR 10 MINUTES!\n\nSCREAMING at paying customers is completely unacceptable behavior, and I will NEVER eat at Alexander's ever again. It's really a shame because I loved their salmon with pesto sauce. But great food can't make up for a manager who throws a TEMPER TANTRUM and SCREAMS AT YOU. Also, you can smell smoke in the dining room, which sucks. My friends and I are BOYCOTTING ALEXANDER'S FOR LIFE!!!"
0,"Crappy, boring, limpid. \n\nThe pastrami tasted bland, the bread was borderline stale and uninteresting, and the whole sandwich was a little wet and lukewarm. Got a Penn Pilsener from the bar, and it had the unmistakable taste of dirty lines - a little sour tang of lactic bacteria. \n\nHow is this place \""famous\""? Is it really? Can anyone please just brine some brisket and hand-slice it?"
0,"I surmised two things from my visit to Thai Cuisine:\n\na) the competition among thai restaurants must not be very stiff in this town\n\nb) yinzers wouldn't know good thai food if it flew into their open mouths\n\nThis place was horrible. My fried trout was just a battered butterflied fish not much different from what you'd find at a church fish-fry. Insipid, over-battered and generally unpleasant. My dining partner's masaman curry was so sickly sweet it tasted like melted coconut ice cream. Surprisingly, the joint was slammed. \n\nOn the bright side, service was very fast. On the downside, our waitress was definitely stressed out and cranky possibly from waiting on the 14-top of inebriated co-eds across the room from us.\n\nThe takeaway: If you're from Pittsburgh, you'll probably love this place -- it was packed with your kinsmen when I was there. But if you've enjoyed quality thai food in any large coastal metropolis, steer clear.\n\np.s. food was needlessly pricey given the poor quality."
0,"I agree 100% on Maggie G's review. Over priced, bad food, and Pittsburgh DOESN'T know GOOD Thai food.. Plus $40 bucks on Take out...seriously? Ill pass I've had better Thai for less. \n\nYellow Curry (Ive added a picture of exactly how watery the curry truly is ) \n(x2) Spring Rolls (2 per order)\nDumplings (5 per order) \nWontons (4/5 per order)\n_____________\n\n40 BUCKS\n\nIll stick to Bangkok Balcony. No more trying out different Thai places in the city. I rather not waste my money on watered down curries and bland dishes which seems to be the norm for the Pittsburgh Thai scene."

0,"Don't waste your money!!! \nWhen I moved to Brookline about 8 years ago, I thought this was a pretty decent restaurant. We always went for wing night, and the wings were very large and quite tasty. My favorite sauce was the honey jalapeno. While the wings were decent and cheap for the size, I had from day one thought the beers were a bit overpriced for the type of bar and location.  The wings kept me coming back, and they were cheap, so I didn't mind paying a little bit more for a few beers. As time went on, the menu seemed to go through a few changes...a few less items, and higher prices, and severely decreased portion sizes. I understand that as with anything, prices are always going to go up, but at the same time, the quality should remain the same or get better! This was not the case here, after giving them a few tries, I gave up. On my last few visits the food was absolutely awful, the portions were minuscule, and overall overpriced. They also did away with the 50 cent wing night. It always seemed that all the owner was concerned with was the almighty dollar. I tried the the corned beef sandwich just after St. Patty's day last year, and the corned beef was almost all fat, it was so bad that they took the sandwich and had me order a new item from the menu. After that I tried the fish and chips around lent, and what a joke it was! You got potato chips ( not home made), and a few tiny pieces of fish that were almost all breading. All of the \""specials\"" that they have, whether they are food or drink, are not worth the prices that this place seems to think that they are. All of their \""special\"" prices are what most other places have as their regular everyday prices! Definitely stay away, and give your money to a local establishment that is more deserving of your money!"
0,"Hi, Every Year since I moved here to Pittsburgh since 2003 we went to the Getaway for St Patrick's Day. 3 years ago the food was terrible, but upon taking the extra order back to the restaurant the next day the owner was very nice & refunded some of my money & promised next year would be great!, It was as he said Great, but this Year was so disappointing my family & I will never go back! The staff was very nice, but we waited 20 mins for a table as we were seated at 6pm the waitress asks us for our order & 2 out of 3 of us had our heart set on the traditional Corn beef n Cabbage dinner, her reply was we are out of that for a while now! That info should have been given to us before we waited to be seated so we could have gone elsewhere, and My dinner was \""Irish Lamb Stew\"" I counted the lamb pieces in that stew I got 4 tiny little chunks so I paid for mashed potatoes & lamb gravy it was terrible and expensive. Avoid Them on St. Pat's Day Band was Terrible as well!"
0,"Note the date on this review because, yes, this place used to be awesome. I keep giving it chances and now i am DONE. I just had the worst meal ever here. It is the NV salad. It used to be my favorite and i would come once a week back in the day. This salad was so nasty...they forgot the cheese...forgot the salsa and sour cream...it was disgusting. Ad the draft beer is luke warm. Not surprising it was empty when it used to be packed on friday night for dinner."
0,"Went to Getaway last night for famous fajitas. Not so famous anymore... Waitress brought steaming hot plate after very long wait, she forgot the taco shells, when she finally got back , she brought pita bread instead, I corrected her she appologized and fixed it. The cooked meat was bland , no seasoning, like they used to have.wifes steak was overbooked and dry.were looking for a new place now."
0,"We ordered two pizzas and wings on a Friday night over the phone for pick up. They told us it would be ready in an hour. Sure, it's Friday a busy night so an hour seemed reasonable. My husband showed up an hour later and it was not ready. He had to park illegally because there is absolutely no parking available here and was very worried about the car getting hit. \n\nIt took another 45 minutes before he actually got the pizza. 1 hour and 45 mins is ridiculously long to wait! They should have cut off orders if they were that overwhelmed!\n\nWhen we tasted the pizza, it was... Okay. The sauce tasted like sugar and the crust was bland. Kinda like the pizza you'd expect from a street vendor at 3am in the South Side. \n\nWe will never be back and will remain loyal to Krazy Brothers and Molly's Pizza in dormont for now on."
0,"Ok I'm from the southhills and realize people in Pgh have no idea what good pizza is. I assure you this place isn't it. Problem is the block heads that love this place so much just say they love it cause they are from brookline and think it's cool to say \""I love fioris\"" with a really slang sound . Hoagies are garbage and sorry but provolone cheese isn't used on a true ital pizza and sweet sauce ? Garbage !!!! After all the garbage food you get unbelievable attitude. Lol this place would not last 2 weeks in New York plain and simple!!!"
0,"Basically when we took our car in to see if they would look at the issues with our car they responded like a bunch of mindless monkeys with wrenches. Toyota will not take the time to find the solution to what is wrong with your car. Do not buy from Day or Rohrich, they will not care about you or whatever is wrong with your car. Also, their warranties SUCK."
0,"We've been to a lot of car dealerships in the last few weeks, and this was hands-down, the worst experience of the bunch. We were first ignored, then made to sit and wait for pricing for more than 20 minutes, for no apparent reason. We will definitely not be going back."
0,Parking sucks. It smelled. They are way way overpriced!  I saw a bag priced at $15 that was apparently donated from a yard sale because it had another tag for $3!  Just really lots of junk. Also it's a cash only place but they do have an atm. Their clothes are sorted by color which is cool.
0,I've been to many thrift stores in my life and this one is definitely over priced! They are selling some items at a price that I could spend on the same item brand new! \n\nThe store closes at 6:00 which is very inconvenient for most people who work a 9-5. I had to rush to get there after work and still didn't get there until 5:45.\n\nIt is a cash only establishment and the staff was very rude.\n\nI'd rather spend my money at Goodwill!
0,"Very sad to find that donuts are made the day before.  I ordered three dozen donuts at about $10 a dozen, and found them to be stale and bordering on disgusting.  With all the awesome donuts in this town, why would you sell \""yesterday's donuts at today's prices?\""  Won't be returning there for any baked products as I have no idea when they may have been baked.  The woman that works at the counter is very sweet, I wanted to support this local business, sadly, I cannot."
0,"If this place is affiliated with the bakery of the same name on Beverly Rd. in Mt. Lebanon, steer clear.  Bought 5 pastries today after I managed to drag the clerk away from her socializing and the one I tasted was so stale, I took a closer look at the others. They had all be dropped quickly in a too big box with no waxed paper in between them so they had fallen over.  The icing was not damaged though as they were so stale they were hard.  I had my husband take a bite out of one and he confirmed it was bad.  We broke the others in half just to determine if any were fresh. Nope. Tossed them all and went to Prantl's."
0,owner is a terrible terrible person. tossed me out for no good reason. i found the food very average overall
0,"\""Filthy\"" isn't a strong enough term. Try \""infested.\""  NEVER, EVER AGAIN. No matter how much I adore Bell's Sicilian pizza (which I typically order to carry out), the filth of the place is overwhelming. Took my mother into the dining room Friday evening. We were promptly seated (table nearest the kitchen and the wait station, constant employee traffic) and given beverages and menus via the hostess, who promised our waitress would take care of us soon. For the next 20 minutes, no employee acknowledged our existence, although we quickly placed our closed menus at the edge of the table to signal our readiness to order. As the minutes ticked away, I tried not to look at the foul carpeting, which appears to have been last cleaned approximately never. A cook emerged from the kitchen and quite literally shouted over our heads to a waitress at the far end of the nearly-filled dining room because he couldn't read her writing. (Have these people never eaten in a restaurant themselves??) Even still, we waited... until I absently flicked at one of the dozens of dark spots on the wall above our booth. It flew away. INSECTS ALL OVER THE WALL. If that's how the front is maintained, what must the kitchen look like??? We reopened the menu, found beverage prices and left money on the table. There was no indication that any of the waitresses or the hostess even noticed. DISGUSTING AND INEXCUSABLE. The place needs to be shut down and fumigated. Are they afraid they'd lose money if they closed long enough to CLEAN? Do they pay anyone to clean anything? I'll never go back."
0,Worst McDonalds!!! they took 45 min for one burger BULLSHIT!!! someone needs fired!
0,"Seriously the worst McDonalds I've ever been to. Service is always slow. I'm currently sitting in the parking lot right now with about 4 other cars from the drive thru that are waiting for food. If I could read my receipt (printer must be low on ink), I'd call the corporate office and tell them to fire the whole place and start over."
0,"Worst service ever!!! We were a party of 10 had a reservation and you think they care about your reservation? Heck no!!! Waited for our table for an hour!!!! No body came check on us, we have been waiting by an empty table, no apologies, and when we ask about the table, they were really mean and rude, the hostess was not doing her job and they ended up kicking us out because they were upset how impatient we were, no.... I think anyone would be upset waiting for reservation for that long. Worst experience ever!!! Will defiantly not go there again!!"
0,"As I stated before , I don't review chain restaurants unless something is outstanding or horrible . Well , this place is beyond horrible . If I could give negative  stars I would . The food was typical McDonalds . Not good or bad . The service , however , was terrible . As I placed my order , the greeting I got was \"" what do you want \"" . The woman who waited on my obviously didn't finish the sixth grade and didn't care about manners . She was slow as molasses even though there were several people in line behind me . After taking time out to BS to a coworker about her weekend , she gave me my order and never said \"" thankyou\"" . I replied \"" your welcome \"" very loudly to make a point but got a mean stare in return . I asked to speak to manager but was told he was busy for next 15 minutes or so . I left and as I was driving away , I saw the manager and two other workers grabbing a smoke near the rear door . No wonder the service was horrible !!! Will never stop here again ."
0,"I go to fast food places a few times a year, at best, so maybe my expectations are a little skewed, but my latest experience at McDonald's left a lot to be desired. There's really no use in rating the actual food, as it's hard to screw up food at a McDonald's. It's all subpar grub, but my penchant for getting filet-o-fish sandwiches this time of year lives on anyway, so I had to go satiate my once-a-year craving.\n\nMy issue was with the service. I walked in and the employees were just chatting it up with their friends and off-hours coworkers who were on the customer side of the counter. It was around 11pm and the lack of customers inside of the restaurant made it pretty obvious that I was the only person waiting for my order to be taken, but that didn't stop the employees behind the counter from finishing their conversations before taking my order.\n\nAfter I finally put my order in, I seemed to wait an eternity (in fast food terms) for my two filet-o-fish sandwiches, regular McBites, and medium french fry order. It was hardly a complicated order, but I've waited less time during peak hours at other fast food chains in the past. Thankfully, there was ONE girl working who saw me standing there for a long time, and asked, \""are his McBites up yet?...where are they?\"" I was happy that someone had finally addressed the situation, but it shouldn't have taken that long.\n\nAgain, I'm aware that showing up at 11pm will probably increase my odds of walking into a late-night, preparing-for-the-next-day mess of a restaurant, but even in fast food, it's absurd to think that the level of cleanliness that I walked into is acceptable. Not to mention, the one girl who was working announcing that she was \""going to pee\""  while I was standing there. I wasn't offended at all, but I found it odd that she thought that was acceptable to say in front of a customer.\n\nI guess this experience reminded me of why I limit my trips to fast food chains as much as possible."
0,"This is my first yelp review. I set up a account just for this review.  I was deeply sadden by the food I received today. \n\nI first started coming here since 1993. I have moved to Midwest four years later. However,  every times I drive thru Pittsburgh,I always stopped here. I really enjoy the general Tso' s chicken. As part of preparation, chicken was fried ahead of time,and fried again when you order, That is why their general Tso's Chicken was so crispy and aromatic when served. I did not have to make this stop, but after driving 450 miles, I wanted a decent meal.\n\nWell, I stopped by and order the Dish for carry out. When I open them(it was not long, 30 minutes or less), they were so soggy, and based on my experience who grew up on Chinese food, it was not fried the second time. The difference? They tasted worse than Buffet dish sitting above the steamer for hours. \n\nFurthermore, I have ordered the shrimp with garlic sauce. Shrimp was hard to chew. It seems like the shrimp the simmered in the sauce for ages. There was no aroma from garlic or onion. \n\nBeing a decent cook myself, I can tell you those dishes I ordered were not cooked by the main chef, or secondary chef. I suspect this is  probably made by the guy who station the fryer. Truly, the taste of those two dishes were so awful, I toss them out. I purchase those passing Pittsburgh, not really possible asking for refund.\n\nI have had so much memory with this place. Rest assured, I won't be coming ever. It was so bad, I would not dear to try again. \n\nI do hope the owner sees this, and make a statement of this incident. I eager to see you standby your dishes again. If I see owner's rebuttal, I would love to call the owner to discuss this encounter further, and willing to be convinced to come back.\n\nSincerely"
0,The oil to sauce ratio for my Kung pao chicken was 1:1 - maybe worse.  I couldn't eat it.  I literally had to rinse it off under hot water in order to salvage a few bites.  This isn't the first time that I have had this problem here.  Takeout is gross.  I won't be back.
0,"Currently sitting in the restaurant. Got seated very quickly, around 7:10pm. For the first time ever, the restaurant actually had more than myself and my fianc\u00e9 in it. We sat until 7:30 without so much as a \""Hello\"" from a nearby server. People were sat after us and have already received food. We finally had to go up to the front to tell the hostess we had not been addressed. She then came and took our orders herself and finally just filled our water glasses. I've never received great service here, but it's never been this subpar either. This may be the last straw for this place. Three strikes and you're out, Mark-Pi.\n\nP.S. I ordered a Diet Coke, and received a glass of what seems to be Robitussin. That, or there's alcohol in this drink. Either case, I'm not thrilled."
0,"So just finished my meal with my family here and I will not go back! The waitress who I don't know her name because it was never shared was polite and efficient. The only redeeming quality I found in the meal was my 2 glasses of wine! Not that the food was bad it just wasn't good! I ordered Moo Shoo Pork with 4 \""Chinese\"" pancakes. Once it arrived I was looking forward to it as the main dish looked appetizing. Then I opened my \""Chinese\"" pancakes... OMG they served me steamed tortillas! I was expecting the crepe style Chinese pancakes and instead I had flour tortillas steamed!!! Growing up and just having moved to Pittsburgh from the West Coast I KNOW a tortilla when I'm served one and it wasn't even handmade freshly cooked tortillas that you get at a chain joint like Chevy's but pull em out of the bag from Giant Eagle tortilla! This not only killed the meal but when the $100.00+ tab came I was aghast! My wife and two kiddos had decent meals but just because you serve large portions doesn't mean you're serving 100 dollars worth of food! I felts cheated by high prices for mediocre chinese (notice the little C) food from a place that used to be rated as  great Chinese restaurant but that was back in 1996 as the plaques on the wall gleefully point out; but only seem to notice on your way out!"
0,"My son and I stopped by China Gate after a movie in the Galleria.  We had eaten there before when it was called Mark Pi's China Gate.  The food was very good.  I think it's changed hands and here's why.  We were seated and given menus.  We placed our order with the waiter and not less than 3 minutes later, ALL of our food was brought out.  I was shocked.  There was no way this order was prepared and cooked that fast.  My son took one bite, I didn't even bother, and we called the waiter back over.  I told her I expected fresh food, not some hidden buffet that had been sitting out.  I got up to leave and she called the manager who tried to force me to pay.  I refused.  I will never go back.  There is such a thing as food too fast.  If I wanted fast food I'd have gone to Mickey D's."

0,"One star for the unpleasant experience I have had at this store. I was treated very poorly by a particular gentleman with an unjustified ego who was working the counter. He dismissed my honest inquiry in a very rude and unprofessional manner. It seems as though he would only care to cater to the experienced musicians who enter his shop. It's a shame he could not assist me with some grace and respect. Because of him, I do not care to return to see if any other staff members are any more helpful. I will not be returning here for ANY musical needs."
0,"We were so excited to try Il Pizzaiolo after hearing about it from so many people and reviews online.  We discovered after arriving that they will accept cash only until further notice.  Apparently this isn't a temporary problem because I saw the same sign on the door a few weeks ago, but assumed it was a one-night thing.  In the era of credit and debit cards being accepted everywhere (even McDonalds and 7-11) it seems inexcusable for a decent restaurant to make patrons withdraw money from an ATM before dining there.  I'm sure we will still try Il Pizzaiolo, but at the moment I'm extremely annoyed with them!  We made the sacrifce and went to Bistro 19 next door."
0,"Coming from the west coast, this is probably the worst sushi I have had in a very long time. There are no descriptions for any of the rolls. They do not offer low sodium soy sauce. The wait for 3 rolls and 4 pieces of sashimi took over 25 minutes. Now for the food, the scallop roll is mushy ( if they were scallops I wouldn't know). Actually, everything I ate was mushy. The service was inattentive. I waited 10 minutes for a refill for my iced tea, after the owner and another server looked straight at my empty glass."
0,Horrible.  Tried it several times.  Taste like frozen Pizza.  Found a hair in it the first time so against my better judgement tried it again.  I swear it was worse than my first experience.  The locals that like this joint must have smoker destroyed taste buds.
0,"This should say it all: we found a dress we loved, it was in our price range, but...we didn't return because of the customer service\n\nI suppose we could have gotten over it to get the dress, but we just didn't want that negative experience to taint our wedding. It was all going so well too. The people helping us were very down to earth, very accommodating and helpful, patient, and knowledgeable. But when we told them that we weren't ready to buy the dress, it was like Jekyll and Hyde and we were given attitude and a cold shoulder. We're talking passive-aggressive teenager-like behavior. Let me be clear - we didn't say no, we didn't say we were going to go somewhere else - all we said was that we weren't ready. In all likelihood we were going to be back in a couple weeks and buy, and just wanted to think about it one more time. It's a purchase that costs thousands of dollars; shouldn't you as the bride be able to take your time?\n\nAnne Gregory is probably the only shop in town worth going to for higher-end, couture dresses. But we've been to nice boutiques across the country and this was the only one that gave us the huffy attitude you historically associate with those types of places. Disappointing.\n\nA few practical notes:\n- They don't allow pictures. Some shops do, some shops don't.\n- I think there's a private lot but if you end up parking in the strip mall parking lot next door or on the street, the spaces are metered so bring your quarters.\n- always judge for yourself...to get a sense of their collection you can go to their facebook page and see what dresses they've actually sold. take care not to confuse the posts they make of other wedding dresses and pictures of dresses by actual customers."
0,"Dreadful, rude service- borderline bullies, poor selection, and they severely mark up their prices!!! Both my friend and I found a dress that they have at other stores for a fraction of the cost. Unacceptable. What a joke, really. Not at all what you want to have to endure while planning the most important outfit you'll ever wear! So upsetting!"

The next morning I checked my statement and I had been charged 25.00 for that single beer.  This is not only a bad business practice but it is illegal and fraud.  But they will keep saying it was an 'accident' as long as they can get away with it.  If you do have to go here I IMPLORE you to only use cash and look at your change carefully. \n\nThis bar should be your absolute last resort in Mt Lebanon.\n\nAt closing time as well, get ready for the Mt Lebo Police Dpt to pull up outside and start hassling people who are WALKING HOME.  \n\nThere are other great bars in Mt Lebanon that are far more deserving of your money."

I think this is one of those places that only sells food so they can allow indoor smoking.\n\nService (there was ONE bartender working the entire place) Is slow, food is overpriced and poorly made.\nI ordered what was described as a vegetarian sandwich, what I got was a poorly made (and TINY) calzone."

The barmaid sat at the bar the whole time I was there...smoking and chatting up her buds. Avoid at all cost. Had to ask for a drink each time, and for the check. But cigar shop is very good"
0,"I've gone to Rollier's a lot over the years whenever I needed a personal touch - something you can't get at places like Home Depot.  Last week I went in with a busted window screen frame.  I wanted to replace it, and Rollier's has built replacement screens for me in the past.  For some reason, this time, MT in plumbing was determined to repair my frame instead of sell me a new one.  He told me that my frame hardware was actually thinner than what he had to sell and it wouldn't fit.  (Later I determined that not to be true - its the same size.)  He said instead he could put a brace across the frame.  OK I said.  I'm always open to saving $50+.  Well that brace added at least 1/8\"" thickness to the frame.  Now it won't fit.  If he was concerned that a new frame would not fit, why would he think this very thick brace would?  I had to remove that brace to get the frame back on the window.  So he wasted my time, probably over 2 gallons of $4/gallon gas, and took $25.67 from me.   So much for the personal touch.  I think I will stick for the impersonal honesty of Home Depot for now on."

0,"Here's the short version: Beware of using a camera in the Galleria! You are likely to become the target of the mall cop and be harassed no matter how innocent your use happened to be, even if you were just taking a picture of a friend of yours. You will have an embarrassing and humiliating experience. Management will not care about your complaint and certainly will not apologize. And, no, I'm not making this up.\n\nHere's the full story: On August 18th 2014 I met my friend George for breakfast at Panera Bread, my favorite restaurant in Mt. Lebanon. We sat together for a little more than an hour engaged in deep conversation. He then asked me to take some head shots of him for publicity purposes so I suggested we walk out into the lobby area of the Galleria to do that. The conversation had been so pleasant and the weekend so lovely that I plumb forgot about how shopping malls have \""no photography\"" policies. Nor of course was there any such notification posted between Panera and the mall. My sole purpose was to show George's face and to keep the background as blurred as possible. That's what defines a \""head shot.\""\n\nI took a few shots with potted plants as a backdrop and then a few more in the central area with posts and beams in the background. Altogether I took nine pictures of George and then we walked to the main exit of the mall on the top floor near Panera to get in his car. Suddenly a man in a Polo shirt ran up to us and vehemently began questioning me about what I had been \""up to\"" and loudly asserting that photography was forbidden in the Galleria. I tried to explain that I had simply taken a few close-ups of George and that I had no interest in depicting the mall and, in fact, had not done so. But the security guy was on a tear. He would not listen to anything I had to say and kept insisting that I had committed a very serious infraction and that he would have to \""detain\"" me, though he never made clear what the point of detaining me might possibly be. By his outraged tone of voice, domineering body language, and accusatory words any passer-by would have assumed that I had broken Anthropologie's window, sprayed paint on Houlihan's marquee, or at the very least had just shoplifted a chocolate bar from the Godiva store.\n\nThe mall cop continued despite apologies and explanations. He threatened to call the police. (And what would they have done with such a flakey complaint?) Though I was under no obligation to do so, I even showed him the pictures I had taken of George to assure him that no crucial mall information had been compromised. Much to my chagrin he then said, \""There's ninety more pictures on that card and I want to see 'em all.\"" He could not be mollified by any recourse to reason. Finally his supervisor showed up and when the situation was explained she allowed as how we could proceed on our way with no further hassle.\u00a0\n\nThis experience of rudeness, bureaucratic intolerance, and downright absurdity left a bad taste in my mouth. It would have been so easy for the guard to have said something like, \""Sir, photography is not allowed at the Galleria mall.\"" To which my response would have been, \""Oh I'm so sorry. I didn't realize that.\"" At this point the exchange would have ended amicably and with mutual respect. That's what I would call a reasonable way of enforcing a policy. As it is, I believe Galleria has overstepped it's bounds and made the experience of doing business there about as pleasant as shopping in North Korea.\u00a0\n\nI wrote an email about this experience and emailed it to the person listed as mall manager, Gine Mercorelli. It was returned as \""undeliverable.\"" I also contacted three executives of Jones Lang LaSalle Americas, Inc. (the operators of the mall). All three had valid email addresses. None of them responded to me. \n\nMy advice: find a more pleasant mall where you will not be treated as a criminal for snapping a selfie with your cell phone."

0,"Worst experience with a hairdresser ever, at this location. Made an appointment with Diane for a body wave. When I was sort of greeted by her she looked at my hair and said \""You get body waves?\"" Yeah, that's why I booked one at your salon. Then she argued with me about when to trim, I wanted after she wanted before, and after five minutes acknowledged that it didn't matter, but FIRST telling me the perm \""wouldn't soak in\"" on the ends unless she trimmed it. Then she argued with me about the rods. It's taken me over ten years to figure out with Aveda perm hairstylists what the perfect combo is. Diane knew better, but finally agreed. Then she proceeded to comb my wet hair, from the forehead back, scratching my scalp and jerking my head. That wasn't enough, though. She then started rolling it with the rods she thought I should have.  I got up and left. When I addressed the problem at the front, NO EFFORT WAS MADE TO HELP me other than to offer coming back and talking to the owner. Yeah. Right. THAT'S gonna happen. Horrible salon...dirty, also, just as a side note."
0,"I went here for the first time on a recommendation. I did not request a specific stylist, and told them I could do an appointment \""any time this week.\"" I received a decent cut, but left promising the receptionist that I would NEVER return.\n\nOnline, their women's haircut price is quoted at $30+. I get a very basic cut, so I expected it to be $30, $35 at most. Only when I checked out was I informed that my cut was actually $44. When I asked why the cost was so much higher than their base quote, the receptionist told me the cost is based on the experience of the stylist. My stylist -- the one chosen for me WITHOUT revealing this policy -- has been working at the salon for 13 years.\n\nI understand this unit of commensuration -- although, I think it's bad for business because it insinuates a customer will receive a much lower quality experience if the stylist is younger. However, if this is a salon policy, it is one that should be CLEARLY stated upon scheduling the appointment.\n\nFrom my perspective, La Pomponnee preyed upon my naivety and (seemingly deliberately) chose the most expensive stylist. This is downright terrible customer service, and it will be the reason they eliminated any chance of a long-term relationship."
0,"This place SUCKS.  The pharmacist and his assistants are EXTREMELY condescending and prejudiced about older people.  My sister's friend was treated extremely horribly by these people and they never apologized, they just said \""we get a lot of elderly people in here so we often lose our patience.\""  They still have not apologized when they lost her insurance card.  If you want to be treated with respect and have competent, respectful service, DO NOT get your prescriptions here."
0,Wish there was a choice of NO stars.  I was in this hospital for 5 very long days and it was a HORRIBLE experience.  I had a kidney infection and pneumonia and had to spend the first night in ER.  No rooms available.  There was no noise control so sleep was impossible.  Finally got a room the next day only to be kicked out because they shut the ward down over the weekend (!).  Absurd.  All I wanted was sleep - so they put me in a room full of loud visitors (I was supposed to have a private room).  Horrible experience.
0,"The place has a quaint look about it, which is why I decided to try it last week. I have to say, that's THE ONLY positive thing I have to say about this place, everything else is TERRIBLE :(\n\nI can't talk about all of their shoes (some look better than other) but the patent pumps they sell, especially the one they sold ME, were extremely poor quality and overpriced - you can get the same shoes from Macy's for much better prices and they won't give you the fake brands either.\n\nWhat happened to me is that the shoe I wanted was on display in another size on the rack and the guy who works there brought me some other shoe from their storage - it looked about the same if you don't look closely but the it is a fake. The quality is really low, it had a different type of lining and sole color, but he claimed it's the same shoe and if I wanted it in that size I had to buy it. Well, either the brand makes really lousy shoes (which I doubt) or the fake brand shoes I got home with me were just not the real thing because I couldn't break them in and after wearing them for about an hour I was in real pain - they not only hurt my feet but the heel tips were so lousy that they immediately got scuffed (they're basically cheap plastic).\n\nLesson learned: even if the shoe looks good on the outside (almost like the authentic brand!) and even if it's sold on Walnut Street, it might not be worth the $50 \""deal.\"" Do yourself a favor, go to a real shoe store (like the Littles Shoes in Squirrel Hill, etc.), this is a terrible boutique with overpriced and poor quality merchandise and I would highly recommend against buying their stuff.\n\nLast thing, I don't think people appreciate being called \""honey\"" in a condescending voice by someone who only cares about profit, and being told lies for that matter! And not giving real receipts (they use hand written ones!) along with a strict 7-day return policy makes it clear they don't want you to have a chance to change your mind (which you will!)...and who knows what other reasons they have for maintaining such lousy policies considering the quality of their merchandise.\n\nI rest my case: AVOID Ten Toes on Walnut ladies!!! Go to Francesca's, go to Banana Republic, just pass right by Ten Toes and don't give them the satisfaction of taking your money for shoes that you won't be able to wear :("
0,I was a fan for years of the Coffee Tree in spite of the lack of seating due to endless working students with laptops.

0,"The Laundry Factory is no longer the clean, friendly laundry facility in Shadyside that it used to be. Its spotless, new interior with its kind employees have been replaced by crass thugs and general filth. Its owner, Gary, enjoys parking in handicapped parking spaces. ((I will attach a picture of him in his car in the handicapped spot later.))\n\nI was a longtime customer of the Laundry Factory until I bought a home 7 months ago.

My, how things've changed.\n\nIn the past, I would update the firmware of the wireless router because the internet was constantly going out.

So they (wet) wouldn't get the (dry) laundry wet again. \n\nAs chance would have it, the owner Gary was around. He was mocking customers as I approached the desk, calling them stupid little rich kids who don't know which end is up. I asked him for a bag; he condescendingly mocked me, telling me they sold bags for 75 cents. I patiently explained that the money wasn't an issue; it's the fact those particular bags are porous and polyester. Plastic was what I needed. He wanted 75 cents for a throwaway grocery bag as well. \n\nI gently told him how often I'd fixed his router. He sneered, saying plugging and unplugging it was no big deal. I explained that I'd updated the firmware and saved him many Comcast visits. He was shocked into momentary silence. I asked if I should have billed him for the repairs. A typical neanderthal business owner, he didn't realize that his clients were kind, or even human. \n\nThe damage was done. As icing on the cake, on my way out, I noticed Gary climb into his van. He'd been there for over an hour. \n\nIn a handicapped parking space."

First, they messed up one of our pants badly. I understand that dry cleaners cannot always clean clothes the way you want, but I have never taken clothing to a dry cleaner and have it come out WORSE than before. When I say they messed up one of our pants, they destroyed it. I went back to let them know and they didn't even say sorry or anything like that. Rather, they were extremely rude and defensive. Did I mention, that they messed up my pant!! .....and still had the audacity to be rude. Amazing.  I tried to politely (even though they messed up my pant) ask them about their dry cleaning process to find out why/how my pants came out worse and they were still rude. \n\nFor your own sake and peace of mind, do not give them business.

If I wanted mediocre food, I would go to fridays or olive garden-- was it comparable?  Yes, for quality of food.  The price, obviously, was much more.  This fake fusion place would have gone out of business, regardless of price, if it had to compete with the likes of Slanted Door or was located in a city with good food.  If this is representative of the best Pittburgh has to offer, then take the money you would have spent here and reinvest it in a trip to SF or NYC and eat well for a week. How sad is that?

0,"We have been regulars at Soba for years, sharing a few appetizers at the bar-lounge on a quiet evening and enjoying the food. Last night was different. For the very first time the food was awful.  A scallion pancake replaced the kimchee pancake. The chef, who we learned was new, obviously had no idea that a pancake is the glue that holds a tasty morsel together. This was pure glue, tasteless and sticky. Where was the content, the taste, the flavor? The lump-crab egg roll was worthy of a corner take-out Chinese eatery, oily mostly. A pulled pork appetizer was passable, nowhere near the dish it replaced. find a new chef quickly.\nJohn E. Raffie."
0,"Went to Umi last night, and it was tough to get a reservation, which is usually a good sign. But actually, in retrospect, its just a sign that people are not aware of the quality of sushi that can be found elsewhere in Pittsburgh. It was sad, really.\nWe began with the miso soup, which was some of the\nbest we have had. Nice and hot, and perfectly seasoned. But it was downhill from there.\nThe salad was just ok. Mixed greens were wilted, but the dressing was tasty.\nWe then moved on to the \""good stuff,\"" or so we thought...\nWe began with the highly-recommended \""yellowtail sashimi with yuzu jalape\u00f1o sauce\"" -- it was overly ceviche'd, and lost its freshness, replaced by a tough, dried-out quality. While a small sliver of jalapeno was a nice touch for sharpness, it didn't compensate for the poor quality preparation of the fish itself. We next had a spicy tuna roll (which, I think, is a barometer for sushi quality in any restaurant). It was dry and average, at best. Nothing special, but no egregious mistakes either. We moved on to the \""sushi entree (assorted)\"", which had 8 pieces of assorted sushi, each consisting of a piece of fish: yellowtail prepared exactly like the previous dish but with rice this time; two pieces of salmon topped with (of all things) cream cheese and a cherry tomato (come on, this was so disappointingly reminiscent of brunch -- where's the caper and english muffin?; mackarel which was less-than-tasty, again topped with a dollup of something indistinct and non-complementary; tuna (average); red snapper maybe; and a paper-thin piece of mild whitefish, which tasted like rice, owing to its diminutive portioning; and a tuna maki roll, which was dry and shriveled and appeared limp, like it was prepared earlier that day.\nI was expecting an artful presentation, but was shocked at the lack of playful creativity that I, at that point, assumed might account for the inflated prices compared to other restaurants in the area (since the quality of flavor was actually MUCH poorer than other local places).\nNext to us was seated a couple on a date, where the man was clearly trying to impress his lady (both dressed very nicely and timidly fascinated by each other's every word and expression). I felt sorry for him, because he was either going to be disappointed with the meal itself, or oblivious to the fresh japanese seafood delights he could be exposing her to just a short drive away. THIS IS NOT A PLACE TO TAKE YOUR LOVE INTEREST, unless she is impressed simply by the magnitude of a check and a mere patina of fine dining.\nOur waitress was sweet, patient, and knowledgeable, and I couldn't help but wonder if she would recommend Umi to her family. I doubt it.\nWe concluded with a dessert that was simply delicious, playful and contemporary -- and weren't surprised to find that the desserts are actually part of the menu of their \""sister-restaurant,\"" Soba (which is a WONDERFUL place). It was the Soba Banana Split - an unusual and tantalizing update of the original (which, I believe, was originally invented in Pittsburgh).\nOverall, the portions were small and unsatisfying, which would've been ok if the flavors were outstanding, but they were not. Not at all! I was shocked, and realized that a restaurant that should be credited with exposing the local eaters to fine Japanese cuisine years ago, has fallen from its lofty perch atop Pittsburgh's international dining choices. And fallen far.\nSo insular a chef can become when his cuisine is lauded for so long, that he can become ignorant of the ever-rising quality of his competition. I suggest Umi's chefs explore other restaurants and realize that they no longer have a monopoly on daily freshness, and that their creativity, like their salad, has become stale.\nTo people seeking high-quality sushi in the area, I must strongly recommend Ichiban (in Aspinwall), and before you question my credibility in recommending a restaurant nestled in a strip mall, think about what makes sushi wonderful. If unwavering freshness, playful inventiveness and sense of fun mixed with elegant presentation and even nice wine pairings, exactness in execution and preparation, thoughtful proportions as well as portions are qualities that not only enhance experience but even define Japanese cuisine, then Ichiban gets it right. Umi, I'm afraid, is way past its prime.\nIt's not that Umi is so bad. It's just not that good. Nothing special.\nI can say I have tried several other places in Pittsburgh, trying to find a suitable place to satisfy my frequent cravings for fresh raw seafood with a characteristically Japanese seriousness in its execution and levity of presentation and flavor combinations. Ichiban is the place that is consistently able to capture this \""essence\"" of Japanese cuisine. But there are others that are also better than Umi, which should no longer, by any means, be considered a standard."
0,"Date & Time of Visit:  May 21, Dinnertime\n\nI don't know what this place was thinking with their eighty-five-dollar, eight-course tasting menu.  That menu had microscopic-size courses and the taste, after the first two (2) courses, were repetitive--and mostly on the sweet side.  Moreover, the place has the sticky feel that one would associate with divey restaurants.  As for their restroom, only one and a unisex one at that.  And yes, there was urine on the floor."
0,"This used to be our favorite place when we first moved to Pittsburgh two years ago.  It had good quality fish and a nice atmosphere/cool staff.  As of our last visit, about two months, ago, the menu still had not changed, the portions of fish were smaller while prices stayed the same, and the atmosphere was on par with that of a Hofbrauhaus.  A drunken man knocked into our table on his way storming out of the restaurant which was immediately proceeded by the members of two different large tables rising from their chairs and yelling obscenities at each other.  It literally looked like there was going to be a brawl.  The members of these tables fairly quickly left the restaurant; however, the staff and manager simply acted as if nothing had happened.  No one came by to see if things had spilled on our table which was run into.  It was absolutely not the experience we expected to have, and it is a disappointment that this place has gone downhill."
0,Paid $1100 for the required course - party of 6 - and unfortunately did not come close to feeling satisfied in any regard - sorry guys - not a fan and way overpriced
0,"I was waiting for my laundry on Ellsworth last week, when I decided to kill some time and find nearby food.  A bagel sounded good and the Bagel Factory felt like an appropriate transition from the Laundry Factory.  I'd never been to the Bagel Factory before, but figured they'd have decent bagels and their coffee had to be better than Crazy Mocha. \n\nThe place was kind of a mess.  When I entered, I saw stacked boxes topped off with cartons of bottled water and individually packaged goodies stacked in front of the bagel case, which seemed sloppy and strange. It felt like a regular storage place for new merchandise, not a new shipment in active transit.  I wondered how an establishment like this could afford to exist on Ellsworth Ave, a neighborhood that is trying to exude upper-class image. Once I looked up from the hoarded pile of shit blocking the counter, my eyes skimmed over the mass of individually wrapped frosted cookies covering the other counter. My mind was taken to the memory of an off-roading experience a few years back; those times when you're driving down the highway in say western Illinois, and you end up at some shabby mom-and-pop bakery, like this one, and you think to yourself \""I'm having a unique experience...\""\n\nGiven that I was coming from the cleanest laundry facility I've seen in my life, these first five seconds at the Bagel Factory were perhaps moderately surprising.  The woman behind the counter had several projects going on and I waited for about two minutes until she asked me what I'd like.  These two minutes were a fascinating two minutes, as the man behind the register was chatting up some eight to ten year old girls.  They might have been neighborhood kids, or not.  There was a familiarity to their conversation, which was only subtly uncomfortable as his tone was sordid at worst, belittling at best.  When they got around to paying for their bagels he asked, \""are they naked or do they have cream cheese?\""  My head turned as the elder of the two said, \""cream cheese.\""  \n\nBy now I'd ordered my bagel and approach the register to pay for it and he says to me, \""got a lotta earrings there, bet you set off all sorts of metal detectors.\""  I responded with \""not really,\"" as I handed him my credit card and he handed me a coffee cup.  He printed my receipt, tore it from the spool and said in a sleazy tone, \""paper trail...\""  I typically would have reacted to that, but lacked the energy after my first round of finals week.  \""Be safe out there,\"" he said as I turned to walk away, which triggered a spine-tingling sensation up my back.  Had i just been sexually assaulted or blatantly judged for wearing a few hooped earrings on each ear?  I was wearing Abercrombie and Fitch, skinny jeans and sperries.  Seriously? \n\nIn the end, it makes no difference.  This guy is a creep, and my feeling is that he holds some sort of managerial role at the Bagel Factory, which leads me to conclude this place belongs out of town ten-twenty miles where this man can find animals to harass rather than little girls and college students.  I generally go out of my way to support small business and family owned operations, but this place is the exception.  I will never step foot in this establishment again.  \n\nThe bagel with cream cheese was alright and the coffee was okay but not worth $5.19."
0,"Don't frequent this business unless you want to be treated very badly. I was subjected to the rudest, most passive aggresive behavior I have ever experienced. Alison made it clear that my job was too small for them to be bothered with, and I understood, but she was disrespectful about it. Fine. I left. Then an installer called to tell me she was sending him to my house. So I went in to choose tile, and Alison was impatient and angry. The installer came. Then I went back  to the store for a third time to buy the tile , only to be told \""I should shop at Lowes\"". Why would a business drive customers away and then pull them back and then insult them and refuse to do business?  I told Alison she had a terrible attitude, and she said \""I know\"".  Something is very wrong with this place!  The employees here should stand on their feet at Lowes for a day and learn to be polite to customers....shame on them!"
0,"Harris Grill was long one of my favorite spots to goto just about any night of the week.  However it's changed in recent months and I don't think I will return.\n\nOn a recent Thursday night, my friend and I had possibly the worst waitress ever.  Her name was Amanda and this is my story about her as our waitress.\n\nShe was not present for about 15 minutes after we were sat.  She finally appeared and asked us for our drink order. She disappeared for about 10 minutes before returning.  She served us our drinks then immediately left for another table. It was another 5 to 10 minutes before she came by again, this time taking our order for food.\n\nShe return 5 minutes later with another round of drinks which we don't remember ordering, but we weren't going to complain. We never saw her the rest of the night.\n\nOther waitresses were making their rounds every 5 minutes out on the patio, but ours never appeared once.  I thought she may have died in back in the kitchen or was burned beyond recognition.  I even asked one of the other waitresses out of concern for her safety if she was okay.  She said they would check.  She returned not long after and said she was alright.  I relaxed a little, until another 15 minutes went by... it was now about 30 minutes since we had ordered and no food.\n\nWe waited a bit longer, we still hadn't seen Amanda (our waitress for those paying attention).  An hour went by and we had had enough. I really couldn't believe this.  Not only did we not have our food, but we hadn't seen our waitress in an hour.  An hour.  What the hell?"
0,"Overcharged $19 and having a food order messed up twice, what more could you ask for? A waitress that doesn't seem to care about any of this? Wish granted!\n\nSo yeah, my food was pretty bland, though my girlfriend said her food was OK overall. Overpriced for what it really was.\n\nI may have come back if it wasn't for the first two items. Instead I'll leave them as a shining failure to customer service."
0,"I have nothing good to say about this place. I've been here on several occasions over the years and here's what I have observed:\n\n1- If the place is crowded (which it almost always is) expect terrible service from your waiter/bartender. Waitstaff has a pretty poor knowledge of their own drink menu.\n\n2- The food will be overpriced/sub par. On one occasion me and my entire party got food poisoning from their fried calamari\n\n3- You will be seated somewhere awkward/uncomfortable. The interior is cool looking but not functional, gets very congested when there are big crowds. \n\nThere are plenty of other bar/restaurant destinations in Pittsburgh that can deliver and execute the same idea in a much better way. Avoid Harris Grill."
0,"Zero stars for service.  Zero stars for price. One star for food. \nI have been to the Harris Grill three separate times for dining.  The first was happy hour - with a party of six. We waited 30 minutes for a table; we watched several tables empty out and stay un-bussed and dirty for more than 10minutes at a time.  Obviously they must have been understaffed.  Once seated, service was extremely slow.  Our server was slow to arrive at our table to begin and take our drink order. Our drinks took even longer to arrive (approx. 20 min from when seated.)  The appetizers were tasty, although overpriced. Buffalo chicken dip was very good. Service remained poor.  Perhaps they were just very busy and understaffed. \n\nThe second time I came was midweek, midday, for lunch.  The place was mostly empty.  Surely we would get good, prompt service now?  Not so much.  All I ordered was the chocolate cupcake dessert.   It took about 25 minutes.  It looked like half a cupcake was dropped on the floor, and then attempts made at making the broken pieces look presentable on a plate.  Half of it was luke-warm, half of it was cold.  Terrible.  WTF?\n\nThe most recent and I promise the last time I will ever go to the Harris Grill was a Sunday for brunch.  Again a 30min wait for a party of 3 to be seated.  I understand that - its Sunday - its Brunch - lots of places have a wait.  But again we watched table after table go empty and stay dirty.  Finally seated it again took 20 minutes to get our drinks - orange juice. And then the waitress only brought two of the three beverages.  The third took another 10 minutes.  Seriously??  Our food took an hour. SERIOUSLY OVERPRICED!!  Several items on the menu were out.  (We arrived at noon for a brunch that was supposed to last from 10-2pm).  The menu was prix fixed at $14.  $14 for two pieces of French toast with disgusted, dried out frozen tater tots. (They had run out of home fries). The eggs Benedict were dried and hardened - just plain gross.  The eggs over easy had no runny yolk. The sausage was very good.  They served us the wrong toast.  You couldn't get worse food or service at a McDonalds run by newborn donkeys."
0,"Let me tell you about my experience at the Harris Grill, I know I have eaten here before, years ago. So I was in need of a lunch and off to the garden. I decided a nice salad would do the trick so I ordered the Salad de la Burgh. While I waited for my meal I was sitting in the little room right off the bar, first thing I notice is the table is a tad sticky, then I noticed the hole in the wall. After these little gems I started to scope out the place, kind of soak in the atmosphere. \""Filth\"" the joint is run down and fifthly, make matters worse was the cement block propping open the door to the patio outside ( this is the front door to the restaurant people ). \nThe restaurant was busy and my server was a pleasant enough young woman. I received my beverage and then started to check the staff out and how unkempt most of them where, jeans extremely tight and unflattering on the best figures, Harris Grill shirts were not much better trust. I long for the day when restaurants hired servers because they had mad skills not because they are young or hip. My favorite is when I realize that under the host station there were bus pans ( dirty & full ), one young employ thought nothing of maneuvering it with her foot ( disgusting it is on the floor but also the unsanitary way it was handle )\nLet me now explain the salad I got for eleven dollars and some cents. The lettuce was about a cup spring mix I think, not crisp and wilty, and kind of room temperature. The chicken was cold, so was the few fries they put on it, and a half a hardboiled egg. I think I found a few pieces of onion? Two grape size tomatoes, and two thin slices of cucumber. \""Oh\"" there was a sprinkling of mozzarella or provolone cheese on it, could not tell which ( they say both so I will go for that ). This was placed in an average soup bowl. To say I will ever go back to the Harris Grill is a definite not & I will warn others to avoid. \n\""PS\"" I did not expect the salad to be huge or grand but decent and somewhat hearty, this was subpar, could have gotten a better one at Wendy's and it would have been warm meat, and fries ..."
0,"I've had a big change of opinion after spending more time in that gym. The equipment would often break down and never get fixed. Considering how small the gym is, it's inexcusable that two treadmills would be out of service for at least a month. I also had problems with the individual TVs on machines; sometimes they wouldn't work properly or would be completely broken.\n\nThe gym was generally quiet enough in the mornings, but it would be pretty packed after work. It was hard to find a machine. The staff also didn't really enforce the 30 min time-limit policy, which caused people to have to wait for equipment longer than necessary.\n\nI was told on the phone I needed to let them know before the 25th of a given month to cancel my membership moving forward (and not be charged for the next month). I wasn't told that I had to give 30 days notice (aka pay for an extra month). Though they're technically right (it IS in the contract), I feel that their staff mislead me.\n\nIf you live in Shadyside (or nearby)... GO TO URBAN ACTIVE INSTEAD. It's cheaper and the facilities are unbelievably better than XShadyside... although I apparently have a membership at XShadyside for another month now, I am 100% done with that place."
0,"Do you remember the crappy apartment you rented in college or grad school?  The one with the bad a/c and dirty carpet?  The one with the barely functioning electrical outlets and tiny, almost useless, kitchen?  Well if you ever want to relive that experience, stay at Shadyside Inn Suites!\n\nI spent six years of my medical training in Pittsburgh and found myself with a few days off last month.  Why not take my wife and young son back to my old stomping grounds in Oakland and Shadyside?  We've found that when traveling with a young child, staying at suite-type hotels (with at least some sort of kitchen facilities and a separate bedroom) is very useful.  The most convenient suite-type hotel to Shadyside is the Shadyside Inn Suites.  Unfortunately, since this business has a virtual monopoly on the area, it must believe it can put its clients up in deplorable, nearly unsafe conditions. \n\nThese comments are based on our experience with the building on S. Negley Ave.  I believe there are at least two other buildings the hotel maintains as well as \""Mansion Suites\"" which are reserved for VIP's or people staying for very long periods.\n\nGeneral Complaints:\n1.  Exposed electrical and cable wiring (see pics).  We tried to spend as little time as possible in the room because I didn't want our 19 month old to inadvertently touch exposed wires.\n\n2.  Dirt.  Everywhere.  When we were getting ready to leave, I did a quick last run through the room to make sure we weren't leaving any of my sons toys behind.  I made the mistake of peeking underneath the couch.  Yuck.  Food remnants, dirt and debris from who knows how long under there.  Disgusting.\n\n3.  General poor maintenance of the building and its parking lot (see pics.)\n\n4.  The furniture in the rooms looks like it has been there for at least 15 years.  Our dining table was strikingly similar to the one I had in college.\n\n5.  No dishwashers.  Not unexpected given the age of the building.  But if you're not going to give your guests a dishwasher, at least give us sponges so we can wash our own.\n\n6.  When you check in, the hotel bills your credit card for the entire length of the stay ahead of time rather than vice versa (completely the opposite of every other hotel in this country.)  Keep this in mind if you want to leave early after seeing the condition of your room.\n\n7.  Three separate keys are required to get into the building and your room.  Again, completely out of date and not particularly secure.\n\nAlso, the vaunted customer service that they crow about on their website must be limited to special guests and celebrities. \n\n1.  When we asked for an extra blanket to be delivered to our room, we waited for over an hour with no response.  Ultimately, we had to drive back to the main office and retrieve the blanket ourselves.\n\n2.   The remote to the DVD/VCR combo had no batteries in it.  I had to get the AA batteries from the main office (I didn't even bother to attempt to ask them to be delivered to our room) and had to wait while the office staff repeatedly found AAA batteries for me.  I was told the AAA batteries fit the flat screen TV remotes in the rooms.  I had to calmly explain that we did NOT have a flat screen TV in our room, rather we had a non HD CRT TV that was at least 10 years old. \n\n3.  Daily cleaning of the room costs EXTRA.  Be sure to read the fine print.\n\nPerhaps some of its other buildings are more modern and in better condition.  Perhaps we had the worst unit in the entire complex... but I doubt it.\n\nUnless you absolutely have to be within walking distance to a business, client or family in Shadyside do yourself a favor and find a more modern, cleaner, safer and better hotel.  Shadyside Inn Suites should be ashamed of itself for the condition of its facilities.\n\n\n(6/11/10) UPDATE... Shadyside Inn refunded the charges from our stay.  \n\nThey report they are adding staff and upgrading their facilities."
0,"I'm granting one star because there's no way to give none.\n\nAs I write this, the door to my room is open, and two burly gentlemen are drilling and hammering and drilling and hammering--I just checked, and it's going to go on all day. Evidently, the inn is installing a new lock system, and for some reason it was impossible to wait until I checked out later today. Counting on solitude and quiet, I'd brought work to do, but it's now utterly impossible to concentrate. I stayed here once before and loved it, but this lack of concern and respect sets a a new low."
0,"We stayed at the Shadyside Inn for months and spent thousands of dollars. I really wanted to write a good review, but the experience was disappointing. \n\nThe quality of service from the staff was inconsistent. Some of them were nice and helpful while others were snarky and rude. When we provided feedback to the manager (Carol S.), she was extremely disrespectful. She was not receptive to customer feedback at all, and her response was very unprofessional, to say the least. \n\nWe also experienced no water or gas on short notice (in the middle of winter) and slippery lobby floors with no warning signs (*we had one bad fall).  And the elevator did not work at times.\n\nWe will not stay at this hotel again."
0,"Bad,  very bad.    Ordered Gin and Tonic.....tonic water was as flat as water.   Returned drinks and ordered wine.   Wine was ok but overpriced.    Ordered an omelet which was basically an egg pancake with the omelet stuff dumped on top.     Home fries were undercooked.   Biscuit had overpowering flavor of artificial butter.   \nThe chicken on the salad was entrenched with artificial flavor.    I think this restaurant does not use 'fresh' ingredients and buys a lot of things already prepared and all they have to do is 'heat things up'.    So their lazy way of doing things certainly has lost us as a customer.   Also....the waitress was wearing cologne or perfume...lots of it...her scent lingered on and on.   NO Server should be wearing a scent at work.   I would equate their food with a fast food restaurant.   Not a compliment."
0,"I'd heard great things about one of the stylists, Richard, so I booked an appointment.  The wait wasn't bad, maybe 10 minutes on a Wednesday afternoon around 4.  The girl who shampooed my hair was great, but sadly Richard was not.  He made a point to tell me we were going to have a \""professional consultation\"" after my shampoo, which turned out to be an exercise in frustration.  He went on and on about how I was a new \""guest,\"" and he appreciated this opportunity to grow the business.  Then when I told him I was growing my hair out, didn't like anything flippy or layered, was willing to lose some length to clean up the back, and just wanted it to look really polished, it was like talking to a brick wall.  What I got were more layers in the front, and he didn't even touch the back.  Then he had a third person blow dry my hair, which turned it into the Rachel from friends, circa 1997 - huge, like a mushroom.  He kept going on about how great it looked, but all I could say was, \""...It's big.\""  His response was, \""You're not used to brushwork, it's okay, we'll do it how you do at home.\""  Could not have been more patronizing.  And I'm from the DC area; I've been to a few high-end salons in my time, and had a few blow-outs.  It's not brushwork in general that I'm against, it's being made to look like a human lollipop that I take issue with.  So a fourth (!) guy wet my hair again, then Richard put more product in, slicked it down to my scalp, and stuck me under a hairdryer machine.  Then he had the shampoo girl blow dry it out for the second time.  All in all a really frustrating experience - one of those haircuts where you get back to your car and want to cry.  I got the impression that the salon was trying to be high-end, but they're all pretension and nothing to back it up.  I wouldn't recommend Richard or the salon to anyone."
0,"I went into Dean of Shadyside salon to get my hair colored. My stylist was nice and friendly however that was not the problem that I encountered at this salon. My stylist rushed through the process of coloring my hair as she had another client during the same time as my appointment. In addition, my hair was just left to hang (not pulled/clipped back) while my hair was being colored making the dark hair dye smear over my ears, neck and face. The worst part was checking out. The charge for the hair color was a decent/normal price around $50.00. However this salon charges you extra if you need more color (if you have thick hair). Are you kidding me? On top on that, they also don't include the blow dry, which yes is more money. Not pleased with all the hidden costs behind my hair color service. Won't be back ."
0,"If you are into crooked haircuts and terrible customer service, this is your salon."
0,"Terrible! I purchased a groupon, but after all of the additional fees (upgrade to a higher level stylist because no one included in the groupon was available for a month, etc) I paid full price without full price service. If you make the mistake of going here, bring cash to tip your stylist. The receptionist cannot handle tips at all. They do offer a shady ATM that you can use and pay the surcharge, then put the tip in an envelope in a comment box. Haircut was ok, but certainly not near what I expected after reading the other reviews. I left extremely upset and no one cared. Terrible customer service!"
0,"The first time I went to Dean, I was content with the haircut I got for about the first three weeks. A men's haircut is pretty straightforward, generally speaking. After about three weeks, though, my hair started looking as though I had just received a bowl-cut - the hair from the top of my head was longer than the hair on the sides of my head, and it was growing down over the sides! The next time I returned, I made an appointment with a different stylist. Again, great haircut at first, but after about three weeks it started happening again, albeit to a lesser degree. The next time I went in, I decided to stick with the same stylist - Erika - as she was friendly (unlike the first, rather quiet and somewhat abrasive stylist) and seemed to be eager to give me a haircut the I liked! I let her know how the previous haircut went wrong, and she actually took what I told her and made changed. Apparently my head is somewhat square-shaped at the top, and if the top is cut a different length from the rest, then it must be done with a narrower section to avoid the issue I'd been having. After all said and done, I left with a great cut that looked great for a solid two months before I went in again. I got one more cut with Erika, and then pre-booked my next cut.\n\nWhen I went in for THIS cut, I got to the front desk for my appointment time, told them I had a 12:15 with Erika, and was then told \""Oh. Erika left. Let's see if we can get you in with someone else.\""\n\nThey didn't call me to tell me that Erika had quit. They didn't even reschedule my appointment with another stylist when she did. I was lucky enough to get in with one when I showed up, but it was back to square one with another haircut-turned-bowl-cut.\n\nIt's no wonder Erika quit - she was too good for the place! Needless to say, I will not be back."
0,"First of all the website, as I was told, \""has been down for 4 years\"" - even though it is very up. The specials and menu prices are apparently wrong.\n\nMy friends and I chose this place solely based on the fact they had advertised $3.50 20 oz Guinness. We needed a place to celebrate our graduation. With a party of 4 that grew to 6 we found the place pretty crowded and loud after awhile. Mostly we were pissed off that we were told on our 3rd round that the Guinness we were drinking was actually $5.50.\n...really, it wasn't even a full 20 oz glass, it was one of those damn plastic cups. When we ordered at the beginning of the night it was quiet and the bartender said nothing about the price. At that point we decided to go somewhere else because it really wasn't our kind of bar in the first place, and you can absolutely find much cheaper Guinness in this city. \n\nThe guy didn't even apologize for the website - it's called false advertising, and it's a dick move, Mr. William Penn."
0,The waitress told us we had to leave our table right after we paid our bill (and tipped her generously) just because we hadn't ordered another drink. I have never been treated so rudely by a waitstaff before in my life.
0,"Crappy's is more like it... sorry I could NOT resist!\n\nThis place is very below average.  The bar is small, good luck getting a seat, it's normally filled with regulars, who I have a sneaking suspicion drink for a reduced rate ;)   Also, the food is blah; they advertise that it is healthier because it is all baked. Um, this results in super fattening foods baked.. this does not mean it is healthy by any means, who do they think they are kidding?? LOL\n\nAnyways, as other reviewers have mentioned the decor is 1975 and wicker all over.  \n\nWith so many options in Shadyside, I don't see any reason to go here."

The service was horrible and their coffee didn't taste great. I waited for ten minutes at least before the two people manning the cashier/bar before I was paid attention to and serviced as they were busy chatting with one of their friends who had stopped in. After getting my coffee, they were low on the sugars and milks and other fix-ins so was not pleased even further, especially for what I paid for a small coffee."

0,"Went to a High Tea here on Sunday.  Although the setting was lovely and the staff was welcoming, the food was nothing special, in fact, it was bad.  We were served three tea sandwiches:  egg salad, which was bland (I make a better version at home), chicken salad, nothing special either, and then a delicious spinach-artichoke bite.  Unfortunately, it was the size of a quarter, it was literally a bite.  But it was the best part of the meal!!!  (I don't think the size of all three of the sandwiches put together was as big as one piece of white bread).\n\nWe were offered two types of scones:  cranberry and eggnog.   Neither was anything special, eggnog had absolutely no taste whatsoever!\n\nThen, the pastries:  we were served a gingerbread cupcake which was fine--nothing like Vanilla Pastry Shop!  A pumpkin torte, again, fine.  And a chocolate mousse/brownie bite with a raspberry and candy cane on top--it was dry as a bone!  It looked as if it was on it's last legs--chocolate was turning white, mouse separated from brownie.  Yuck.  \n\nOh yeah--I had a delicious tea from Harney and Sons (used to be sold at the Grand Floridian High Tea in Disney World), cinnamon spice!!!  Unfortunately, when I asked for more tea, they gave me new hot water and the same old tea bag! \n\nI've gone to various teas so I feel I can give a good comparison.  Not impressed at all!  Will not go back there, ever!"
0,I am in the service industry and my friends and I came here for my birthday. It was the worst experience and the bartender wouldn't give us lemons or limes for our drinks. She was rude and all over the place. We would have spent a lot of money but she deterred us from that.
0,"The parking lot is a clusterfuck.\n\nThe entrance to this location always smells like spoiled milk. \n\nThey usually have everything except what I am looking for and/or I just can't find it because it is not placed with similar things. Like when I went looking for organic hot cocoa mix...a week later I found it, not with the other hot cocoa mixes, but very randomly on it's own display at the end of the Asian foods isle. Gnocci? Not with the frozen Italian things, but with the other frozen Italian things...\n\nAnd then when I finally find that one item that I desperately wanted enough to look for it here, I face the crazy check out lines where one has plenty of time to analyze a disturbing cross-section of consumer society, at which point I often re-think my desire for the superfluous item in hand, set it down and swear to never return to this store again."
0,"ETA 2/23/12: Rather than shop here once a week for $25 (down from my 100-200 bill 5 years ago) I now shop exclusively Whole Foods, Trader Joe's and the new Target. There is never any reason to set foot in this Giant Eagle ever again.\n\nI've been a resident of Pittsburgh since 2006 and been shopping at Market District since it opened. Steadily over the past 5 years it has declined in quality. Here are some reasons why:\n\n-The staff and workers surly, unhelpful and downright arrogant. If I have trouble scanning a coupon in self-checkout (which they always manually input and is *always* the machine's fault) it takes me 5 minutes to fla a person down. They're chatting or BS'ing with each other and ignore me. Although there are 20 some checkout lanes, there are never more than a dozen checkout people. This is nonsense. I've shopped early in the morning, lunchtime, 3pm, 7pm and late at night and there is ALWAYS a line for checking out. The lone good employee is Jay, a kindly older man with white hair. Jay is competent and runs circles around others. Jay once loaned me his cell phone to call someone when my wallet and phone were stolen in the parking lot years ago.\n\n-The food is constantly, insanely rearranged. Why do stores rearrange food? So you get distracted and buy more stuff. This is a proven marketing strategy. However, it has gotten to the point in the last 6 months where they move things around SO often and at random that the employees can't keep up. I have to ask for help to find basic vegetables I buy every week (broccoli & cucumbers, for example). In the past 6 months half of the time the poor staffers themselves don't know. I blame Giant Eagle's moronic \""middle management\"" types for abusing market research. \n\n-The food is rarely replenished. For awhile I would have to ask a stockperson to get whole wheat tortillas from the back EVERY WEEK and I don't shop on weekends when it's super busy. This went on for 3 weeks until I finally started buying Trader Joe's whole wheat tortillas - which are always in stock. This has happened for the milk I buy, the shredded cheese, cereals, canned goods, etc. \n\n-The selection is getting crappier while prices rise. More and more products are stocked that are low-brow and fewer new products are stocked (or current products kept in stock) that are more expensive. For example, the rows of Kraft mac n' cheese expand while organic Annie's mac 'n cheese decline. Giant Eagle Market District is serving a well off population. If people from Oakland and the Hill are coming in, build another store for them. I don't wish to shop at a store with more Shurfine products. I understand that food prices have gone up 10% this year HOWEVER I don't see prices increasing at other grocery stores.\n\n-The prices on frozen vegetables is insane. Whole Foods has their house brand of vegetables for $1.25-$1.50 whereas retail Birdseye at GE are $2-2.50. Prices on Hagen Dazs and other high end frozen goods are slightly cheaper or the same price at Whole Foods.\n\n-Overall I find the prices on fruits and fresh vegetables as well as frozen vegetables to be lower and more stable at Whole Foods. When canned goods like whole canned tomatoes or organic beans are on sale at Whole Foods, the deals are better than at GE. This was a place that in 2006 was known as \""Whole Paycheck\"". I spend more and more at Whole Foods these days. Those mini babybel cheese rounds? $1 cheaper at Whole Foods. \n\nIn short, instead of spending $100/week at Giant Eagle, I am minimizing my budget there as much as possible to $25/week. I shop mostly at Whole Foods and Trader Joe's now and even a bit at Target, which had 1.5 pounds of Wild Alaskan Salmon for $9 the other week. The farmer's market serves my need of fresh vegetables in the summer. \n\nGiant Eagle has really screwed itself lately. Their employees are surly and useless. I find the most helpful employees and clean, well stocked stores to be Whole Foods and Trader Joe's. As it is we spend nearly as much on food as we do on rent. We are a target demographic that is disgusted with Giant Eagle.\n\nAs for the girl who says she has a \""foodie boyfriend\""? Please. If they required specialty ingredients they would be going to Whole Foods and the Strip District.\n\nBad move, Giant Eagle. Bad move."
0,"Store has a lot to choose from, but we have had HORRIBLE service from the bakery.  Went into the store three times to order our wedding cake, left my contact info only to have no one call back - I finally get someone who can talk with me about a cake at 9am on a Sunday morning, and now they can't do it on a week's notice.  I called the Giant Eagle Marketplace in Robinson, they said no problem, come into the store, we'll have someone to meet you, we'll figure something out.\n\nI guess the snotty people in the Shadyside store just don't need my business."
0,"This is a customer service based review, The one star is for selections because this store has items other locations often do not. \n\nDisclaimor / Accountability check todays incident which I am writing this review on is partly my fault... the part where I got zero assistance from customer service is their fault. \n\nSo I stopped here for ground lamb for an awesome stuffed mushroom recipe... I like to think I am speedy and smart when I need to be so I run through self-serve checkout. This is my third grocery store stop of the day. Warning!! for anyone who uses self checkout at this store do not forget your bags!!\n\nI accidently leave a bag in the self serve area but do not notice until I return home..... eek. It's ok though because I have my receipt, upon returning home in about 20 minutes I phone customer support. \n\n\""Hello I left a bag in your self serve area I still have the receipt is there anything you can do?\""\n\n\""Let me see if it was reported by our staff.\""\n\n\""Ok it was ground lamb...\"" \n\n\""Nothing was reported yet so there is nothing I can do unless its reported.\""\n\nI pause and think to myself.. really nothing.... even go check the area yourself to see if its still there?\n\n\""Again I ask oh really is there nothing you can do?\"" While thinking to myself basic problem solving skills nothing fancy....\n\n\""No I am sorry nothing we can do.\""\n\nHmm well if that's it then I guess I will go to Whole Foods the next time I need something fancy and overpriced for a recipe. Who ever got my ground lamb or didn't enjoy it on me... \n\nI heard Whole CEO treats employees badly this is an ethical issue for me but sometimes you have to make a personal choice based on your experiences."
0,Another bad experience.  The staff is sloppy.  The deli doesn't mark the product and passes off whatever slimey old crap they're trying to get rid of as what you ordered.  And good luck parking.
0,I got tired of waiting in line with one register open and 10 people in front of me. Won't be back.
0,"I needed Italian bread for an event so there was no choice except to buy the bread that was available. The bakery had plenty of Italian bread but therein lies the problem- I buy Italian bread on an almost weekly basis so I know the way it's supposed to look as well as cost. For about the third maybe fourth time now the bread yeast hasn't risen all the way. It looks like squashed sourdough bread instead of Italian bread. Instead of about 4\""-5\"" it's about 2\"" thick. To add insult to injury the bread even costs more during the times it was thinner. Instead of the bread costing $2.49 just like any other day it cost $2.69 when it's thinner. Does that make any sort of logical sense? I am disappointed and this review is emotional in nature but there are actual facts here as well."
0,"Everyone complains about how expensive Whole Foods is in this area, but I find the Market District to be even more expensive for lesser quality. I despise going to this location, it is always packed with the rudest people imaginable and the employees act like they have anywhere better to be than at work. I have worked in a grocery store before and it is not always the most pleasant, but the way I have been treated there everytime I go is beyond imagining. Giant Eagle has managed to monopolize grocery stores in this area and kept out other chains I would prefer such as Wegman's. The produce here is subpar and anytime I do buy it I end up with a swarm of fruit flies at my house. I once saw a tomato display crawling with hundreds of them and the employees did nothing. Go to Whole Foods and buy their store brand, you'll save yourself money and be around employees who are enthusiastic to help."
0,"I never really understood why Doc's was so popular.  I personally find its only real saving grace to be the outdoor deck.  Otherwise, the prices suck (beer served in 10 ounce cups on special for $2.50 - come on), the food is mediocre, and the atmosphere is nonexistent.  The drinks are weak as well.  \n\nIf you're looking for a night out, there are better places close by in Shadyside.  The deck really is nice, but it doesn't help the fact that the prices are terrible for drinks, especially for what you get.  That being said, I end up here a lot because others seem to like it...maybe I'm missing something."
0,"The pedicures at DeStefinos  are a complete rip-off. IMO\n\nWhen I booked the $53 pedicure, I was told\n(1) it would last an hour ,  and would\n(2) include  a foot massage   \n\nNot true:  the manicurist was done in 45 minutes.  and \nThe advertised  foot massage consisted of a quick rub of my feet and lower leg, finished in two minutes or less.  \n\nWhen the manicurist was done, I complained that\nmy feet were still rough.  \""You can't possibly expect your feet\nto be smooth after only one pedicure.\""\n\nExcuse me?  and why not?  Every other pedicure I've had\n(for much less money) got my feet smooth,"
0,"I'm changing my review after a bad hair cut that was not handled correctly. I went in told her what I wanted, showed a picture and she decided to barely look at it and totally ignore everything I said. I said I wanted some short layers in the front and long layers in the back and I wanted victoria secret model hair. Instead she took the opportunity to do whatever she wanted and I ended up with chopped off layers of one length on the sides and no long layers in the back. It looked like I had 2 haircuts one that was shoulder length and the rest long. Nothing was blended, it just did not make any sense nothing about it was good. It was horrible.\n\nWhen I went back to get it fixed by her she just kept trying to defend why she did the hair cut and why it looked good. Ignoring the fact that I was unhappy and I didn't like it. She just kept trying to cover her ass instead of listening to my concerns. The fix turned out ok but still not what I wanted in the first place.\n\nI just wanted her to listen to me and stop making excuses. And I thought the manager or head stylist should have come over to talk with me but that never happened. The front desk girls were not friendly or helpful as well.\n\nSo I will never go back and I'm sorry for suggesting this place since I only got a trim the first time I went here and could have had the same cut from anywhere."
0,"I ordered pictures through the online photo center and requested them to be printed and picked up from this location. I selected and paid extra for same day prints and were told online that they'd be ready in 1-3 hours. I went to pick them up several hours later and the guy behind the counter couldn't find my photos. He said, \""Oh, it must be because our printer is out of ink, we should have your prints on Friday or Saturday\"" This is Wednesday, I need them today! If I wanted them in 4 days I would have paid $10 less! I asked for them to send my file to another location so that they could be printed there. No such luck, they said they were not able to do that. Now I have to upload, size and crop all of my photos again and reorder them to be picked up from another store. If they would have just called me this morning and told me the problem, I would have my pictures in time. Now, it's far too late for any Rite Aid to print my photos tonight. Come on people, communicate with your customers! Thanks for nothing!\n\nGo to the Baum location. It's just around the corner and far nicer inside."
0,"Tiffany prices with Kay Jewelers selection.\n\nI've gone to this place a couple of times to look for various items over the past few years.  Every time I leave the store I always try to remind myself never to come back.\n\nThe prices are way more than what they should be.  Tacori rings and other merchandise is marked up about 30-40% more than other jewelry stores in Pittsburgh.\n\nI've had a couple of nice salespeople work with me, but some of the others were just plain rude.  They try to do a great job preying on Love by upselling items or addons that aren't even necessary.\n\nThere are many other great jewelry stores in Pittsburgh that you can look at other than here."
0,"I recently had a horrible experience at Girasole. I used to really enjoy going to this restaurant due to its cozy atmosphere and decent Italian food. However, this past visit was unfortunate. The host was horrendous and extremely rude. I had brought my parents, who were visiting from out of town, and they were appalled at how rude the host was. Girasole is usually quite busy but it was also disorganized. I had made a reservation and arrived early knowing that there would be a wait. However, we saw three tables be seated prior to us, all of which had arrived much after us. When we tried to tell the hostess, he was even more rude than when we had arrived. To be honest, I could have overlooked the seating other parties prior to us if we had at least been given a friendly smile or a warm welcome. \n\nRegarding the food, it is adequate, nothing in comparison to other much more exciting and fulfilling Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh."
0,"I've been to girasole many times and have loved the food. The reason for the low marking is because of the service the last time I visited.\n\nIt was over the holidays and my family was in town. Since we were a party of 5 I called the day before to make reservations for 8pm on a Wednesday. We got to the restaurant prior to our reservation time and they said it would be half an hour. We are easy goin people so we didn't mid waiting.\nThe owner instructed us to go to the bar next door and have a drink. After 45 min I went back to the restaurant since they hadn't called us yet and he instructed us to go back to the bar.\nFinally after waiting an hour and a half they finally sat us. This bothered me for two reasons. 1. The people who got say before us did not have reservations, walked in after us, but knew the owner. Very poor form on the owners part. 2. He said we would \""be taken care of\"". I was thinking maybe an appetizer or wine, something for promising us a table with reservations and then having us wait for over an hour. But when the bill came there was none of that.\nWe still had a good time since the company was good but it will be a long time before I go back to this restaurant."
0,"My girlfriend has been a regular of this place for years and could not wait to take me when I came in town for the Steelers game. We did not make a reservation and showed up on a busy saturday night around 8:45pm fully expecting a long wait. My girlfriend had forewarned me that there will be a wait so when we showed up we just expected to put our names down and go across the street for a drink while we waited. We ended up waiting in the front of the restaurant for ~20 minutes without anyone taking down our name. A few waitresses mentioned that the older italian guy (owner) took down names. We were ignored several times by him as he came up front - no biggie we saw it was busy. An older woman came up to us several times and asked if we had been helped, we replied no, and she reiterated that the older man dealt with the \""list\"". We were fine up through now and were still waiting when the older guy came up to the front and shoved the older woman (his wife?) and proceeded to scream at her for several minutes. The entire restaurant went quiet and was staring at the front of the restaurant (where we were awkwardly standing as well). The older gentleman was screaming that she was always interfering with the list and he was done with it. He kept going on and said that why did she even care about a couple of \""out of towners\"" who will never come back again. (which was even more shocking because my girlfriend was a regular and had regularly conversed with the man many times before). \n\nWe subsequently left while the man was still screaming at the woman. This was the most absurd display at a restaurant I have ever seen. My girlfriend was extremely upset especially for the physical violence the man was displaying. This was no casual shove but rather a full two handed violent push followed by pounding his fist on the table and screaming at the woman in front of the entire restaurant. Needless to say we will never come back and recommend people boycott a place where the owner treats his (wife/employee) with such disrespect regardless of how stressed he may be on a busy night."
0,"My boyfriend and I had just casually walked by Girasole to see what their menu looked like. Before we even asked for a menu, the front of house staff quickly asked us whether or not we wanted to sit outside squished behind a baby's highchair in a corner or inside where it was very crowded. We tried to politely ask the man if we could see a menu first. After looking at the menu we decided we liked what the menu had on it, but it was just really crowded. When we returned the menu to the front of the house staff he snatched the menu away from us and said, \""Yeah I knew you guys weren't going to buy anything anyway\"". What if we were about to order something? That completely turned us away from this restaurant. We could tell we were just another group of people to get in and get out. Very rude and unacceptable. Never going back."
0,"Awful service. We made reservations 4 weeks  and when we showed up the host yelled at us because they were over booked and his excuse was it was God's fault because the weather took away his outdoor seating. He also didn't offer us an apology and kept on telling us where we couldn't stand. The most annoying part is that he was drinking a glass of wine the entire time while shuffling people around! Wish we could have tried the food, but there is only so much indifference one can handle."
0,"Beware the loud-mouthed lout working the front. We stopped by a couple nights ago and asked to check the menu. Finding it acceptable -- despite an abundance of starch with minimal protein -- we walked away to go find the other members of our party to return and ask for a table. But we were accosted by a boorish old man who kept yelling \""Hey!\"" until we turned around to see what he wanted. Come to find out he wanted to insult us by telling us to check out the hamburgers across the street if we didn't want or couldn't afford his fare.\nWell, needless to say, we didn't go back and had a fine dinner elsewhere. Tip to the house: Insulting the public is no way to win friends or customers."
0,"The owner has a complete disregard for customers and the customer experience.  I arrived with my parents at 6pm, just as it stated to get busy.  We submitted our name thinking it would be 20-30 mins.  As tables became available he would seat groups that he knew and/or had reservations.  It was like we were invisible.  As the wait approached 40 min I went up to him and asked how many reservations there were and if he had any idea how much longer it would be.  He looked at me, mumbled a sentence with the word \""ridiculous\"" and said he didn't know.  I politely told him it wasn't a big deal and said he could remove our name from the list.  As we were leaving he came out the door and said we could sit outside (it was 50 degrees with a chance of rain).\n\nOnly reason I'm leaving this review is because my mom was all worked up and felt disrespected.\n\nI just can't support business owners like this.  Go elsewhere."
0,"It's been a minute since I lived in Pittsburgh, but I frequently return to attend events and visit close friends from school and work. I think Pittsburgh has absolutely wonderful food, and I truly became entranced with the culinary scene while attending Carnegie Mellon and checking out local fare. Luckily for us CMU kids, Shadyside was a hop, skip, and a jump away. Therefore, it was naturally the perfect neighborhood to dine and shop.\n\nI had the opportunity to attend two group birthday dinners at Girasole. Both times the food was authentic. The place itself is very small and intimate, so it has a very nice, cozy, if not bordering on claustrophobic feel. That is not the impetus for my review. Both times I have dined here, the customer service was intolerable. A moment that I will never forget in all my life was at my birthday dinner, when the waitress came to our table as we were about to leave, and said to our group, (my friends who had graciously paid for my dinner) \""why is the tip so low? What was wrong with my service?\"" My friends had left this woman at least a 15% tip. I will never forget this publicly humiliating moment for the rest of my life. This should serve as a reminder and a stark warning for all who work in customer service (as I have myself) that you should never, ever do something as atrocious as what this waitress did. There were so many alternatives to how she or the restaurant itself could have approached this, but I truly believe she acted in the least responsible, most alarming manner I have yet to see from anyone who holds a job. That is the prime reason why I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."
0,They always take weeks to get things done & overcharged. I was ok with that when they did a good job. But then they stopped doing a good job. Not worth the hassle anymore & do a poor job.
0,"I went to Molnar's for a state inspection and an oil change.  I dropped off the car that day.  Later, a mechanic called me to tell my my check engine light was on.  He said it'll cost $99 to do a diagnostic to pull the codes to find out what's wrong (FYI, the actual code reader cost $20 online).  I gave the Ok.  He found two problems and it would have cost another $400 to fix it.  I asked him to just fix one of the two problems since I couldn't afford both.  He seemed a bit annoyed that I wasn't doing both repairs and kept repeating to me that it won't get rid of the engine light.  \n\nThree weeks later, on a Thursday, I came back to get the rest of the problems fix.  The same mechanic said the parts needed to be ordered from the dealership and it will be here Monday at the latest.  He said he'll call me when the parts come in.\n\nOn the following Tuesday, I decided to call him since I haven't heard anything from him.  He told me he didn't put the order through because he forgot.  He told me he had a rough weekend.  Told me that he'll order it right away, and reminded me that it takes a few days like he \""told me before.\""  This time around, he did call me and let me know the parts were in.  He also gave me an estimate that was $100 higher than the previous estimate.  He asked me to bring in my car on a day he's working.  I said that I needed the car by 5pm as I needed the car for work.  He said it was no problem and that I'll be the first car he'll work on when he comes in.  He said he'll put me down for an appointment.\n\nOn the day we agreed, I went to drop off my car.  No one was there yet except for the owner(i think).  I told him I got an appointment to drop off my car for the mechanic to work on.  He looked through his book and didn't see my name and let out an annoyed sigh.  He took my info and I gave him my keys.  I told him I needed the car ASAP.  He replied, \""Yeah, everyone does.\""  At which point, I pointed out that the mechanic said he'll do it ASAP for me.  He just ignored me.\n\nLater that day, I got the call from the mechanic, telling me he ran into a problem.  Stripped bolts were preventing him from removing the part.  Told me he'll have to break surrounding parts to remove it and those surrounding parts will need to be replace because of it.  He said it was too big of a job for him and I should take it to a dealership.  He then added that the dealership ....sent him the wrong parts anyways....\n\nI ended up getting the repair done at the dealership and got my state inspection.  Guess what?  There were no stripped bolts.  No surrounding parts needed to be broken.  I think I was lied to because he ordered the wrong parts and didn't want to be bothered with getting it right.\n\nIn my opinion, Molnar's mechanic and owner are very unorganized.  Their communication skills need serious work, with the customers and between themselves.  I will admit, I had no issues with the oil change and the first repair they did.  But the hassle and the amount of time I spent trying to get repairs done through them wasn't worth the time.  I hate giving a business one-star, but they deserve it."
0,"I'm taking the previous poster's advice and contacting the BBB.\n\nAfter nearly 5 hellish years with Mozart, this week I received a notice from them stating that they weren't renewing my lease.\n\nWhen I called the only incident they pointed to as an explanation was because I warned my neighbors of the peeping Tom that was masturbating outside of our windows on the fire escape. There are numerous young college aged females that live in the building and Mozart refused to install motion lighting of any kind. After the 3rd incident I contacted an attorney, warned every tenant with a notice and threatened to contact the media if they didn't do anything about it. They still refuse to install motion detected lighting, there are just very dim fluorescent lights out there now instead.\n\nMozart then began updating my apartment on the guise that they were bettering it for me, when in actuality they were doing it so they could show it to others. They put in new floors and a new cabinet -- I even had to stay in a hotel (at my own expense) because of the dust, dirt and lack of a floor in my bathroom!

0,"If I could, I would give this poor excuse for a managment company \""0\"" stars.  I've barely in my place for 2 weeks and have had all sorts of problems.  Let's see the second day I moved in, the bathroom ceiling started to leak and then ultimately fell.  I was told that upon the initial complaint of the leak, that this was \""normal\"" and that it was a result from the upstairs neighbors not fully closing their shower curtain.\n\nI'm not sure if this maintenance guy thought he was talking to a total moron, but somehow I doubt that a few sprinkles coming out from a bathtub in the above unit b/c the shower curtain didn't close all the way would cause a rain-like down pour in my bathroom.  I promptly contacted the management company during normal business hours and they came in and put a temporary board up until they could fix the problem.\n\nI stressed to them to please resolve the leak as replacing the ceiling wouldn't fix the real problem.  They said that they would look into it and replaced the ceiling but still needed to do a paint job and some plastering to seal the edges.  I waited a week to see if they would do the \""final\"" touches to the bathroom.  They didn't so I had to call them to see if they were ever coming back to paint the wall that was ruined by the water damage.  They told me that they would try to get around to it but they have lots of units they have to work on...ummm so when did it become ok to do a half-assed job and leave a tenant with no time frame on when it would be completely done.  \n\nI figured I would follow-up with them regarding the final touches to the bathroom when low and behold the ceiling near the front door fell without warning, and from my perspective no reason at all.  If someone had been standing there, this would have caused serious injury.  This happened on a Saturday so I called and someone came to put temporary board up.  \n\nI planned on contacting them during normal business hours (M-F 9-5) to make sure that someone would be fixing the ceiling when I noticed the the bathroom ceiling (that they had just replaced) is starting to get discolored b/c of the leak.  So it's just a matter of time before the bathroom ceiling falls again since they failed to correct the source of the problem which is the leak that I had explicitly mentioned.  \n\nSo if you want to move in to a place that is falling apart you should definitely move into their apartments.  I just can't imagine having to deal with this a year .  I already know that I will NOT renew my lease or EVER rent from this management company again.  \n\nAlso fyi - don't bother calilng the emergency number b/c they'll either tell you there's nothing wrong or not show up at all.  This happened twice to me so far within a two week time frame."
0,"I lived in The Pennsylvanian for one year.  It was so intolerable that I moved a month early and just ate the cost.\n\nThe pluses: from a distance, the apartments are decent. and the maintenance staff is always around.\n\nThe minus: the maintenance staff is always around.  As in, they took daily lunch and gab fests directly outside of the my living room window in the courtyard.  I'm not trying to be an elitist, but I would have liked to have been able to use the table right outside of my apartment in peace.  \n\nAdditionally, they do random pest control, which is an excuse to snoop in your apartment.  Once, they found \""a used pot soaking in soapy water and a teapot on the stove\"" (verbatim from the letter they sent me), which was considered \""unhygienic.\""  This was a search they did without any warning to me and while I was at class.  I'm obsessively clean and generally didn't even leave any dishes soaking ever and I keep my CLEAN teapot on the stove since I make tea often.  It was insulting, and to make it worse, they insisted that they had to come back once a week for the next three weeks to check on my sink's cleanliness.  Whoever had \""inspected\"" my apartment had rummaged in all of my drawers.  I then had a real estate lawyer friend remind Mozart of my rights, and they didn't bother me again until I moved out early--they were upset I was leaving the apartment \""abandoned,\"" even though I had paid the rent through the end of the lease.\n\nFurthermore, they absolutely refused to tell me when they would be spraying for these so-called pests, which I believe is why they started doing the \""inspections\""--to spite me.  Their staff is horribly rude that way.  After they posted a sign about spraying for pests, I went into their office with a note from my physician explaining I have very serious asthma and needed to know what they were spraying and when so I could go somewhere else for a couple days.  They said I was hindering their pest control, and then started the weekly inspections of my apartment.  This was after they randomly showed up unannounced and re-finished my bathtub while I was in class, and just left a note saying I couldn't shower for 2 days on the door.  The smell was so strong that I would have had to leave for that long anyhow.  Hence, why I asked about the pest spraying.\n\nThe dry wall from the ceiling fell suddenly in large chunks all over my bedroom once, and it took 2 days to fix and they left dry wall dust all over my room (this was after I had cleaned up from the first dry wall).\n\nIncidentally, the first person they showed my apartment to took it, and the realtor thanked me profusely for having a such a nice set-up that it made it so much easier to rent than the \""messy\"" units...I'm guessing places with TWO dirty pots in the sink."
0,"I am a nice, amicable person. I treat others with kindness and have a highly positive attitude. I rarely complain about things. Thus, it makes me sad to write a negative review. However, the way in which Mozart Management Staff have behaved and conducted themselves over the past two years warrants this review. We moved to Pittsburgh when I was in graduate school. We loved our tiny, cute apartment at Schenley Arms, our first home as a couple. This abruptly changed when simple calls to request that they salt the driveway were met with aggression, irritability and statements such as \""we have never had a complaint before\"" and \""we cannot accommodate your schedule\"". I felt guilty at first about calling, but then had an epiphany and realized that Mozart has serious issues. The tone of their written  correspondence is also highly intimidating, demeaning and threatening. I will not bore you with the additional myriad of complaints that exist. What ever happened to customer service, decency and basic regard for other human beings?    \n       If you value your hard earned money and do not want to be met with criticism and hostility when interacting with your landlord..AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Also, there are a fair amount of negative reviews when you do a search on Google..READ AND BELIEVE THEM. They are completely mean and disrespectful. This is not the kind of business I want to support, as it conflicts with my value system. We are moving out ASAP when our lease expires. \n\nPS the maintenance staff are fabulous and deserve 5 stars! I hope they aren't treated as bad as the tenants."
0,"I can only comment on the lease application process, but my experience was very negative. They started out easy to work with, but that was short-lived. Scheduling apartment viewing was simple, and the people who showed me the units were relatively friendly. The issue came when I actually went to sign a lease.\n\nI was told on the phone and in person by the person showing me apartments that I would not need a cosigner, but as soon as I showed up for my lease application appointment, they told me I would need a cosigner. I scrambled to contact my mom, who was willing to cosign, but they said they needed BOTH parents to co-sign, and they wanted me to sign an agreement saying I would forfeit the $1000 deposit I had to pay upfront if I did not return all of my cosigners' documents within 7 days. This was an issue because 1 of my parents was out of town for the week. \n\nI tried compromising with them and seeing if they could change the agreement to give me an extra few days to get the cosigner paperwork in, or to see if I could just have my mother (who was more than financially stable) be the sole cosigner. They were unwilling to compromise at all, and I left after about a half hour of unproductive back-and-forth discussion. \n\nI could have gone back a week later, when both parents were in town, as the unit was still available, but I figured any place that difficult to work with when I was trying to give them money would be even more frustrating once I was contacting them for things like maintenance requests. I wouldn't say \""never ever rent from them\"", but I would definitely be aware of how rude / difficult they can be."
0,"They just broke into my house without any notice to show around. They knocked so violently I almost mistaked it for gunfire. Then, before I was able to say anything, they broke in. There was at most 2 seconds interval between the knock and the break in. I wasn't dressed, and the guy just said \""Oh hi, we're showing the apartment\"", and stormed into my kitchen. Ridiculous. I started ranting as soon as they left the room. This is totally invasive and disrespectful. I didn't read their lease very carefully when I moved in and I totally regret it (they shoved it to me and told me everything must be signed by the end of the day, so I thought whatever, how bad could it be?). Apparently, breaking into the house without any notice is written into the lease here, and if you don't comply, they'll fine you as much as your unit's monthly rent (around $1000 for telling them no you can't enter the house). I've heard of several cases like this. They're unbelievably hostile and try to juice as much out of your pocket as possible."
0,"Mozart Management - Georgian on Ellsworth - AWFUL BUILDING\n\nI have maintained video proof of all my miserable experiences living in my unit on the first floor for almost three months so far, and have provided proof of a couple of them here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH8llYlRPz2Qm7ovPQWSlyA\n\nThis is the NOISIEST place I've ever lived, and I read ALL bad reviews posted about them previously, and what every single person before me wrote is completely and 100% accurate.  \n\nMozart Management rented me and apartment on the ground floor directly across from the Maintenance Room/Office.  I had no disclosure of this whatsoever when I signed my lease.  There is no sign on the door, no evidence that this is where I would be renting a unit, or I'd have never signed a lease for this.  \n\nYou will hear every single floor board in this building, whether it's above or beneath you.  The maintenance crew is helpful, they are NOISY and completely awful to live by.  Due to my location in the building, I hear them all day long, every single day, clearly from my unit because there is a lack of insulation.  \n\nThey are often heckling and telling personal stories down the hall to one another, and I almost feel like I know more about their personal lives than I do of my own.  I don't even understand how they have the time for this.  The phone in the office rings all day long (also sounds like it's coming from my apartment, that's how loud it is) and I also get to hear every conversation made through walkie-talkies.  Every single day I hear the same man coughing and blowing his nose in the office as if he were sitting on my sofa doing it.  It's absolutely disgusting, and you get no peace whatsoever.\n\nAlso, my apartment unit sounds like a construction unit on any given day.  On the other side of the hallways, something else I was never informed of, is some sort of tool room.  I often hear saws, drills, vaccuums, you name it.  All day long.\n\nMozart has made an effort to calm the crew down for inappropriate content, but it's still not enough for my unfortunate apartment location.  My family and I did our research about this matter and it really is up to a rental company to first and foremost to provide a tenant with a peaceful and safe environment.  I never feel at peace here, and as a single female living solo, I am feeling less and less safe as I've become aware of having to share such close quarters with older men every single day that I do not know.  We asked kindly to be released from this lease, but Mozart feels they should be compensated from ME, even though they were creeps about disclosing the truth about this apartment.  Now, I am stuck due to the heavy fees it would cost. \n\n\nI REALLY wanted to like Mozart despite all of the bad reviews.  I'm truly not out to get anyone with writing a negative review.  But what the other renters have said IS true; Mozart's SOLE concern is about money, not the comfort or satisfaction of their customers.  They are untrustworthy, know they are untrustworthy, and are completely comfortable with being unethical.\n\nFor the amount of rent paid here (I pay $860 a month for a 1-bed), I've learned you can find a similar, possibly even lower deal, right around the same area in a much more peaceful building."
0,"Okay I wrote my previous review when I was mad at them for breaking into my apartment. I want to provide a more complete and responsible review now, so people know what to expect for living at Mozart.\n\n1. READ THE LEASE. I have to put this in capitals because I didn't. It's very long, so I didn't bother. I thought, how bad could it be? I've lived in various apartments during college and everything was peaceful. You just have to look at how much you have to pay each month and what the deadline is, and some other stuff like lost keys and maintenance. Mozart's lease lists out at least a dozen things that they can fine you with, and the prices are ridiculous. On the top of my mind, there are full month's rent for refusing uninformed inspection, full month's rent for not returning keys on time, $500 for any animal, 3 month's rent for moving out before the original date of leave, if you \""move out\"" because you died your relatives are required to pay that 3 months rent... And there's a policy that states that by signing this contract you waive your legal rights according to (some law that I forgot). I don't have time to bring this to court but I don't think it's legal to make such a contract.\n\n2. They provide almost zero service. We once called them for clogging in the sink and bathtub, and maintenance showed up for the first time over a week later. And it took about a month to actually get it fixed. I think there was a 3 day period where we weren't allowed to shower to fix the problem. And there was also this time when maintenance showed up in the morning when I was in the shower. They told my roommate that they'll come back next week if I can't get out of the shower immediately. Also I think there was this time last winter when the heating broke down and we wrote them an email, and they said \""we don't take responsibility in alarming you of things like this. I would advice you to shut the windows firmly and use blankets to block where wind might blow in.\"" What? My neighbor moved out after 2 months of living in mozart because of things like this. Mozart gave no shit about his quality of life living there or anything they could do to make stuff less of a problem. He had to pay a fine equivalent to 3 months rent ($3000+), but he moved out with no hesitation.\n\n3. They are extremely rude. I remember explaining something to them in email for an expensive fine that I didn't think was my fault. And they replied in a middle school bully tone which basically said \""we don't care what your circumstances were. you owe us a grand. shut up and pay asap\"". So I replied in demand for an explanation for their attitude, and my next couple of emails were responded by three different person, each saying the previous went out on vacation. Lol yeah. And I can't remember the circumstance, it was either moving or parking or cleaning, but I swear I've been called an idiot to the face by one of their people. They might seem polite when they're trying to sell you the place, but they'll show their true disrespectful nature when any conflict arise. If you can deal with that, welcome to mozart. Later a friend told me that it's probably because that the fine is $1000+ that they're so determined to milk that money out of you without listening to any explanation you might rightfully have and going as far as to insult you to sound firm.\n\n4. Oh, by the way, I don't think they really know their place. They were showing the place to some potential tenants, and they were pointing at stuff that we brought in and said it comes with the apartment. I had to tell the ppl seeing the place that it wasn't true, that the microwave, wardrobe, mirrors were actually all ours. I'm really surprised the guy showing the place didn't call me an idiot in the face right there lol. Anyway, I'm saying this, if they look nice at your first encounter (especially if that's before you sign the lease and everything), don't believe it. They'll never be as nice after you sign, unless you get a perfect room with no problems and you never talk to any of their staff.\n\n5. The price might look okay, but it really isn't. I think my rent was a bit over 1000 for 2 people, but utilities are not included, parking is not included, and they have the highest laundry fee I've ever seen. Plus, they fine you a grand for the most trivial things. So think about how much you actually have to pay to live in such a bad place.\n\nAnyway, I'm very happy that I moved out. If you are thinking about living there, DON'T. It's gonna be a nightmare."
0,Absolutely horrible. My sink has been overflowing onto my countertops and ruining my belongings multiple times. Management did not even apologize for my inconvenience.
0,"Unable to find the place. Initially told it was only open on Mondays. Later learnt the location had changed. Finally, told by a taxi driver that they had shutdown."
0,"After waiting in line for about twenty minutes our group was seated.  The place was completely packed.  It looked like someone's basement or garage with tables in it.  Various photos adorned the walls.  I tried the world famous hot cakes.  They were delicious, except I only ate 1/4 of them since there was a very long hair wrapped around the hot cake.  Pamela's turned out to be a waste of money for me and I left hungry.\n\nThere's nothing THAT great about Pamela's.  It's like breakfast at most any other diner."
0,"How Pamela's became a Pittsburgh institution is completely beyond me. The food is average at best (think a step or two above Denny's or Waffle House). Pancakes were soggy and bland and the veggie omelete was chocked full of processed, cheese-like goo and assorted goodness straight out of a can."
0,"There are 2 types of \""Good\"" restaurants in Pittsburgh. There is Yinzer good and Actually good. This food is Yinzer good. Way too much butter and sugar. Yuck."
0,"Unless you've been here before, let me warn you about the \""unspoken house rules\"": \n\n1. Order first (do not try and sit down).\n2. Wait for your food while standing.\n3. Find a seat (if one is available).\n\nUnder no circumstances should you sit down before placing an order. And if the place is full, don't try and sit down without food in your hands, unless you want to be made an example of.\n\nMy wife and I (who frequent restaurants several times a week) have never experienced anyone quite as rude as the woman behind the counter at this place.  We had never been here before and when we walked in, my wife sat down at a table and I went up to place our order.\n\nLittle did I know the house rules (see above) and after the people in front of me ordered, the obnoxious cashier pointed to our table and to another table (of newbies) and said to the person who just placed the order: \""you can either sit there or there\"", with the tact of, say, General Patton. She never asked us to get up or explained the \""unwritten rules\"" to us.  An \""excuse me, but you need to order first before you sit down\"" would have sufficed.\n\nSo, my wife got up and we walked out of this place. The food could very well be good - but with waitstaff like this woman - there are plentty of other places around town with not-so crummy service that I'd prefer to spend my money."
0,"The crepes served by this establishment might very well be the culinary embodiment of a mind-exploding, toe-curling, orgasm.  I say, \""might be\"" because on my recent (and last) trip there I didn't have an opportunity to sample them.  In fact, I didn't eat anything at all.\n\nPlease let me explain.\n\nThe restaurant is located in the basement of a building off of Walnut Street.  Customers are expected to wait in a line that stretches from the entrance, through the main dining area, to a counter where the crepes are ordered and cooked.  It's a horrendous setup for multiple reasons.  \n\nFirst, there aren't many tables.  When I went there on a Saturday morning, there were at least 20 people standing in line for the ten or so small tables.  Second, the restaurant expects you to wait in line, standing next to tables of patrons who are eating their food, until a table becomes free.  At that point, the woman at the counter takes the next order, a man begins preparing the crepes, and the front of the line is seated while everyone else continues to wait.  Those who have waited long enough, are finally able to sit, while hungry and impatient diners-to-be stand next to their table and wait some more.\n\nIt's a horrible atmosphere, and not one conducive to a pleasant dining experience.\n\nThe dining space is poorly designed, so that the line of waiting patrons snakes directly though the middle of the cramped dining area.  Which means that when you are waiting, you are continually bumped by servers shuttling food to the tables and dirty dishes back to the kitchen.  When you are eating, you are likely to: 1) have a bunch of hungry people staring at you eat, waiting for you to leave your table, so that they may be seated; and/or 2) have a standing person's ass within a few inches of your head.  What a great dining atmosphere!\n\nWhat's all the more annoying is the lackadaisical work ethic of the people who prepare the crepes.  More than once during my wait, the man making the crepes just stood around, not making any food, waiting for another table to open, so a party's order could be taken, and he could then prepare the next order.  \n\nAfter waiting 15-20 minutes while hungry, becoming increasingly annoyed at being bumped at least 2 dozen times by serves traversing the line, and then seeing the owner stop making food until another order was taken, I said to myself, \""enough of this nonsense\"".\n\nMy party and I left to go to another restaurant.  I've not eaten any crepe in the world that would justify a long wait under such annoying circumstances, and I will not be back."
0,Pompous manager hung up on me twice (!) when I called to ask about wait times.  Have never boycotted a restaurant until now.  Mediocre crepes don't entitle that sort of bush league behavior!
0,"Who deleted my review of Sunnyledge?\n\nBack in April, I met a girl for drinks at the Sunnyledge.  We had both heard good things about the place and that they had a great martini menu.  When we arrived there, however it was a different story.  We were met at the door by the hostess (I presume) who did not take our arrival kindly and seemed annoyed that we were there.\n\nWe shrugged it off and went to the bar.  The bartender was something else and it seemed as if he was on a variety of drugs. He acted as if he was on the last quaaludes in his posession and moved with a subtle grace most often reserved for Miss Universe pageant constestants.  And that's saying something.\n\nThe bartender would disappear for long periods of time, during which we would hear odd sounds coming from the kitchen.  Mostly the sounds of silverware banging around.  It was as if the hostess and bartender were throwing cutlery at each other in attempts to get us to think just what the hell was going on.  We were there for about 2 hours  and during that time saw the bartender a total of 4 times.  Most of the time he was hiding out in the kitchen.  \n\nEven when it came time to get our check, it took about 15 minutes for him to return with my card.\n\nTerrible service that night from an otherwise reputable place.  I have no plans on returning.\n\nI hope this isn't deleted again, and if it is, I will make sure it's well known and will take printed copies of this and put them up around Sunnyledge and use every contact I have to get this printed in the Post Gazette and City Paper.  I have the means, I have the will."
0,"*For the bar\n\nWhile looking for places to have Easter brunch, I saw the Sunnyledge appear several times in my searching. They no longer do easter brunch, but they do have their martini bar - which many people seem to rave about. I should have stopped to think twice upon seeing that all 5 reviews here on yelp are at least 2 years old, but I threw caution to the wind and arrived early on a Friday evening.\n\nJust getting off work, I came alone. The location is a historical landmark, a mansion built in 1889, and is the reason they deserve their single star. The mansion, from the lobby in the bar appears beautifully kept. The walls are dark and decorated with wood and stained glass. The furniture is elegant but not stuffy, and the bar was obviously once a den or a library that was converted. The bar is rather small, housing four 2-seat tables, a 4-top, and about 8 spaces at the bar. Behind the bar, light shines through a small collection of liquor bottles. The top of the bar and tables are inlaid with tile patterns and candles are spread throughout.\n\nI browsed the martini menu, not finding much that would suit my palate as it all sounded sweeter, or too far from a martini(tequila, cointreau, and orange juice is closer to a margarita than a martini - and that Jose Cuervo on your top shelf doesn't send a good impression of your margarita). I stuck with the classic, then, and ordered a basic dry gin martini without garnish. \n\nIt was made quickly and without love, shaking instead of stirring, and putting it in an un-chilled glass. Not that there was much to love, while the bottles on the shelf could be called mid-range, the bottles used for my drink and for others were right out of the bottom of the barrel. Banker's Club is the gin of choice here, and Burnett's flavored vodka is the base of most of the drinks on their menu. The martini came(Not filled to the top, seems they measure precisely to include garnish), strong with little vermouth, but given the alcohol, devoid of any flavor but ethanol and a hint of citrus.\n\nI found as I drank that food is no longer available at all in the hotel as they no longer served as a restaurant, even though signage was still in place throughout the building. I quietly finished my drink and closed my tab. How much did my room temperature Banker's Club cost? A cool $9.\n\nIt appears that somewhere between the last two years and now, this hotel must have come upon hard times or new management. If you are staying at the hotel and need a drink, hop a cab to Walnut street. At least your hassle will be eased by a much better drink."
0,"I usually enjoy shopping at the Gap, but I recently had a really bad experience.  I went in to exchange a shirt and when I asked the orange face goblin manager if they had any more he was incredibly rude.  First, he wouldn't even look at me when I asked him a if there were any more of the shirt I wanted to exchange, and him immediately told me they did not have any of these.  Since I was in a hurry I just decided to return the shirt, then on my way out of the store I saw a whole table display of the shirt in several different colors.  The costumer service really ruined my experience."

When I saw that it was a vase of a few blue and white flowers, I was furious and feel ripped off!!! The order my family placed online was so awesome!! A puppy made of flowers in a ceramic pumpkin candy dish!! It was not even $60 including se day shipping!! The photos on his website have several larger arrangements made for $65-85!!!

0,"Just like every other Wendy's you've been to, except with slower service! Employees show no sense of urgency. There are two cash registers inside but I've never seen more than one being used at once, no matter how long the line is. Last time I was here, it took 30 minutes from the time I took my place in line until I received my order."
0,what is it with Wendys ?  They never get the orders right. If any of the employees would smile I would die from shock.  This review applies to many of the Wendys  that I have been to. Even in Florida.  Do they train them to be rude and ignorant ?
0,"The food here was greasy, uninspired and bland. The mockmeat \""chicken\"" was too chewy and the dish felt oily and heavy. It was something I grew tired of in a matter of five or six bites.\n\nI was also disappointed that they don't serve brown rice.\n\nThe service was friendly enough, though. \n\nNot to be recommended unless you're desperate."
0,"People who reviewed this place as being GOOD... obviously retain the taste buds of a snake (fyi: snakes have no taste buds).\n\nCame here with my parents while we were scoping out apartments for me to live in. Wanted to go to Pamela's, but the line was too long so we walked a few doors down to China Palace. I was REALLY wary because I did a quick Yelp search before we walked in, but my dad insisted that it was probably \""not that bad\"".\n\nHere's what we ordered:\n- Cheese wontons (Um... they literally just fried american cheese in the wontons. Who does that?! It's supposed to be CREAM CHEESE!! And they gave us some disgusting mustard sauce to dip it in.)\n- Chicken Lo Mein\n- Beef Lo Mein\n- Shrimp and Broccoli w/ Sweet and Sour Soup (The soup was the most disgusting texture of I-don't-know-what. Needless to say, that was left untouched.)\n\nLet's just say, not only did it take 30-40 minutes to get our food (for food that was of LESSER quality than Chinese takeout), the food itself was just utterly disappointing... A complete travesty to Chinese cuisine. It was bland, yet greasy and MSG-ridden (if that makes any sense). Not only that, they also didn't have BEEF CHOW FUN (ok, so whoever claims this restaurant serves \""authentic\"" Chinese food clearly has no clue on what they're talking about). And the kicker? It came out to about $32 + tip for food that we DIDN'T even finish half of. We literally just got up mid-meal when we overheard the table behind us complaining about how they found a dead fruit fly in their bowl of rice.\n\nDO NOT GO HERE!!! ... unless you're a snake that is."
0,The worst chinese food I've had. I got the General Tso's Chicken and it came dry and very not spicy at all when I asked for extra spicy. Panda Express is better.
0,"Yuck! I  hadn't eaten here in years and it will be years until I return. The wonton soup was watery, and the wontons were inedible. I ordered pepper steak wwhich they substituted pork sparerib meat and I surmised that they didn't think I would notice. Also I think the health dept needs to perhaps male a visit;the place is dirty."
0,"I have never, ever thrown food away, but I couldn't stomach this stuff. I got the pork fried rice and egg drop soup. Holy moly was that a poor decision. The rice tasted like a flavorless mush with chewy \""pork\"". It tasted nothing like pork, or meat for that matter. I tried adding soy sauce for some kind of flavor but dear lord that didn't help. The soup was a weird creamy mess. My friend got the general tso chicken, which should generally be a safe choice. WRONG. cardboard. Cardboard with a strange tangy sauce and a side of disaster. Seriously we've never been so grossed out that we had to throw out $20 worth of food but that's what happened."
0,Disgusting...The general tso that I ordered for delivery tasted like fish. I called and Verna tried to convince me that it was because I made the mistake of not requesting white meat. She then tried to tell me that they don't deep fry anything with fish. This was interesting because I am sure that the shrimp egg rollls that I ordered were indeed deep fried...in the same oil that my chicken was fried in. She told me that the delivery driver would be there in an hour to pick it up and i call and she tells me that they only way for me to get the refund is if I bring it in myself. Very rude and horrible customer service
0,"This store is shameful to the Shadyside family. Upon entering the shop, the blond sales associate judged my friend and I by staring at us and abruptly walking away without a greeting. My friend was given dirty looks form the elderly sales associate while I tried to ignore the rudeness and enjoy the clothing. I am not complaining about the prices, I have bought many items from the same designers and enjoy the designers quality, I was not sticker shocked. What I am upset about is the customer service by these women who think it is okay to treat potential customers with such disrespect. Neither me friend nor I were dressed poorly, we are both fashion stylist in the Pittsburgh area. I have never been so disrespected in my life and after writing this review I will be contacting the owner."
0,So I wrote a review but it was filtered. I think people should know how awful this place is before stepping inside. I have no ties to this place; I don't know any of the other owners of shops in Shadyside and I am 100% un-bias and wrote my review purely on my experience there. Why was it filtered?
0,"Food, blah.  Pierogi with chipotle butter app was terrible- frozen Mrs. T's pierogi in PITTSBURGH is just lazy, and they were drowning in greasy, room temp aforementioned butter which carried heat with absolutely no flavor.  Everything else was of unremarkable to poor quality. Main courses were a cuban sandwich and something I don't recall (bad sign) and were extremely disappointing.\n\nService, argh.  It was late, but if you're open you're open, right?  Slow, inattentive, wrong sides (which we couldn't correct given the service) an they basically vacuumed around our feet."
0,"While it has a somewhat trendy looking menu, don't be fooled. We ordered the calamari, mexican pizza, ahi tuna, and french onion soup. While the onion soup was actually good, the rest was awful.\n\nThe mexican pizza was greasy, and looks like it was reheated in a microwave, it tasted like cardboard, and looked even worse. The calamari was awful, came with a gross looking/tasting dip. The ahi tuna was actually just mediocre, which was a nice improvement from the rest of the meal. \n\nIf i was a bigger jerk I would have demanded they take the food back, but I just had a bite of everything and asked the waitress to take it back.\n\nI would never eat here again"
0,"This restaurant is in a great location and has nice ambiance. That is where the positive ends. The food is LOUSY. I paid $9 for a stainless steel mixing bowl of iceberg lettuce with a little frozen (OK, it was thawed, but had previously been frozen) corn, about 4 tablespoons of black beans and the same amount of feta. As a vegetarian, this salad was one of two that had some sort of substance to make one think of a meal. What a disappointment - I won't be back."
0,"Generally speaking, I am a huge fan of Williams-Sonoma. In CA, I love their store in Union Square. The service in this store is ridiculous. The ladies seemed to be complaining about something the whole time we were there and seemed to have an attitude as if we were intruding into their space.\nThe real kicker for me, though, was that they advertise for free gift wrapping but don't seem to really offer it. The first time I came in, my boyfriend spent around $50 on a gift for a friend. We were excited about the gift wrapping but then they said they don't offer gift wrapping after 5 pm. Seriously? Why not? They weren't busy or anything at that moment. Why couldn't they take a couple minutes and wrap our gift for us?\nThe second time (and the last time) I came in they just said \""no, we don't wrap\"". I was so confused and annoyed that I just left after paying. I haven't written a review in over a year but their horrible service motivated me to say something.\nBeware of these ladies. They just aren't nice."

I was told that they had cakes available but to hurry because they close at 2:00 p.m. sharp.  I arrived at 1:58 p.m. and the rude lady would not let me in.  She kept pointing to the clock.  Pool customer service.  I will NEVER go back.
0,"Went to the monroeville location using a groupon for the free tooth whitening.  The first visit, they said i had cavities that needed filled...ok...so I got them filled the same day....and they weren't filled smoothly!!  I had to come back to get the filling smoothed out because they left a ridge and it was bothering my mouth!! \n\nthey also said i needed MI paste (for $30 from them when online it's ~$15)....ok...so i got that as well not knowing it was something I could get outside of the office\n\nI had to come back in for deep cleaning.  When i got there however and went through the process, the \""deep cleaning\"" didn't seem like a deep cleaning at all.  The initial cleaning the first day seemed more thorough and hurt longer. They did all four quadrants in one session, no novicaine (which if you've had a deep cleaning before...it HURTS.....I needed the nitrous oxide the last time I had one.....and it hurt for multiple weeks after as well when I went before).  One of my friends that also has had deep cleanings also said that they're painful and hurt for days afterwards.  This one instead didn't hurt except when i was poked a few times, and i was fine to eat/etc right afterwards.\n\nWhile getting the deep cleaning the hygenist (because I never saw the dentist except for the fillings when in the past I saw them for deep cleanings as well) said that my mouth was much better and that she thought the pockets (the reason for the deep cleaning) were probably false pockets, that my mouth was much better than the previous month, that I probably didn't need the deep cleaning and that no antibiotic would be needed...maybe if I came in next time I would need them.  So I got a deep cleaning that I may not have needed, didn't feel like a deep cleaning, and set me back $900....in about an hour (they also usually take longer)\n\nPoor experiences multiple times...\n\noh--and never met Carl."
0,"Ordered chicken wings. They looked very unappetizing, especially after I picked one up and it had feathers coming out of it. I understand things happen, but the situation was handled very unprofessionally. I'm not sure if our server was embarrassed, but it seemed as though we were avoided after the issue was brought to her attention."
0,"Worst nail salon ever. \n\nI made the mistake of buying a Groupon for a mani/pedi here without really doing any research. Not a smart move on my part. The place was totally dusty and there was no AC. Being that it was like 90 degrees that day, it was hotter inside than outside. The manicurist, who was very chatty and nice enough for one star, didn't put any lotion on my hands, or clean my nails at all-- just quickly filed them and slopped on the polish. The top coat gathered in some parts and made it look thick and chunky- completely uneven. \n\nWhen I stuck my hand in the dryer, I accidently bumped and smudged a nail.....and her remedy (wait for it...) was to LICK HER FINGER AND BLOT HER SALIVA OVER THE POLISH. I just kinda stared at her in shock, unable to speak. \n\nMaybe folks in Castle Shannon are into this kind of vibe, but I will continue to stay within city limits the next time I feel like endulging. It was just a bad scene."
0,"Everything about the pedi was ok except the polishing part.  12 hours later I had to wear shoes, and the polish smudged because it was slopped on so thick it never would have dried. \n\nAs she was polishing my nails, I was thinking, \""Man, that is way too thick!  It'll never dry!\"", but I didn't say anything because I thought maybe she had some super topcoat that would make the impossible possible.  Well, she didn't, and the polish stayed not just tacky, but downright WET for 4 hours, before I finally just SCRAPED the goop off and painted them myself.  \n\nI will never be back, and wish I had saved my $30 (I had a Groupon) and my $15 tip.  Should have just done them myself."
0,"I had a mani pedi today and they were brutal....so painful!  Ask her to just push your cuticles back otherwise youre in for some pain.  She actually cut me during my manicure and I had to ask her to quit f ing cutting my cuticles it bled so bad.  It's like having the worst papercut you can imagine then it really did not feel good at all the one she put acetone on it.\n\n\nI literally had to take my hand away from her and say stop let's not mess with my cuticles anymore! The owner was sitting right there and didn't do anything or say anything. \n\nnow I've got a gold sparkly nail with a nasty ass, scab around it  she apologized but she cut my freaking hand I was really unhappy and I will never go back. Also see the picture of the lovely job she did on the manicure the color was not on evenly and it looked like a five year old did it.  The pedicure it was really good but it was just so painful if you can book with somebody else but do not let this woman near your cuticles and tell her to be gentle because she certainly wasn't with me.\n\nPart of why I am so freaked out about being cut is that my nail got painted with that lovely sparkly gold nail polish while I was still kind of bleeding. That can't be hygienic I mean you should all know that I am perfectly healthy and hepatitis free, that is a communal bottle of nail polish! And I was bleeding! I feel like a kind of is a really big deal.\n\nPlease know that I hate leaving bad reviews. But they made me bleed! And the pedicure was really really painful! I would like to stress again though that my feet look awesome. The salon was very very clean and the technicians were very nice.\n\nBut I left stressed and bleeding!"
0,Meh. This is not my kind of place. The food always seems oily or greasy and doesn't taste that good. Plus they have yellow fried rice. That is a big NO NO for me. It is kind of like mushed cardboard. I don't like it at all. I haven't eaten here in a while and i don't think i will start anytime soon.
0,"If you like waterlogged pasta, runny sauce and food that really is not that good, by all means eat here.  \n\nWater is cold, so that's a plus."
0,"Horrible experience. The food itself was good but way over priced for what it was.  They charged us for every little thing.. extra sides of dressing after they brought the wrong kind to begin with, a side of vinegar, surprised they didn't charge us for the extra napkins. Service was terrible to boot. Never will go back. You'd have better service and food at Olive Garden...and that's hard for me to say."

0,"I'm from eastern PA and NJ...I wanted a simple Meatball Parmigiana sub. for dinner. Apparently Danny doesn't understand what this is or..doesn't know how to make one. I was told they have a meatball sub or a chicken parmigiana sub...but not a meatball parmigiana sub.  Are you kidding me?  How hard is it to split a sub roll down the middle, add 6-8 meatballs (depends on size), red sauce/gravy cover with mozzarella cheese and throw in the oven till the cheese is melted...Danny if you read this you owe me for this recipe!!  Give me a break. I left without my sub and got one from Italian Village Pizza just down the street. Dude this is not rocket science..."
0,"GO TO PLAN B!  This is NOT a shop you want to give your business!  I have been a very good and generous customer for too many years.  If you are in Linda's chair (one of the owner's) you will get an excellent cut/color BUT, you will wait!!!!  And wait.  I can't remember a time I raced to get there and did not have to wait 10 min, 20 min, 30 min, even an hour, b/c she tries to do too many things,  and so, you wait!!!!  Also, I recently went to get a hair cut and she lost her focus, b/c she had to stop and finish someone and then stop again to check foils and then stop again to answer questions and she totally changed my style (that I was growing out 6-7 months) and she knew when I left I was not happy, but she said to blow it out myself tomorrow and it would be okay, it wasn't and when I told her it was a terrible, the worst, with no rhyme or reason, and that it took me an hour to blow out and how frustrated I was, she imploded on me for 40 min, telling me she couldn't look at me!  It was ALL about HER and not my terrible hair cut that I had to force her to fix, making it even shorter and still treated me horribly, no one believes my story, that ME, being the customer, she didn't care or try to make it better at MY convenience,and after all those years.  Her partner, her sister offered me a refund, I never asked, and I still have the voicemail confirming our talk and the refund and yet, no refund. After all the wks of aggrevation and  frustration, they shot their integrity to hell over a $49 check!  REALLY?  STAY AWAY!  There are many other salons that do really good work and you are geared to the customer.  I found one I love and there were many recommendations to me.  So, go to Plan B, Plan A, Hairtique, nah!"
0,"I DID like this place for over 30 years and was a customer of Linda, one of the owners for that long.  I was always good to her and we were 'friends'.  My last appointment there she was too busy dealing with interruptions (phone call, checking foils and stopping in mid-stream to finish off someone), as she is with every single appointment I have ever had. She lost her focus on what I wanted and cut away, totally changing my cut and I was not happy with the results.  She told me to go home and work with it the next day.  The next day came and it was a mess, when I told her her, her LARGE ego was hurt and a wk later she ripped me a new behind b/c I didn't like my cut.  Really?  This is how you treat a long-time customer, yell at them for 45 min b/c your ego was hurt?  At first she REFUSED to fix the cut.  After I TOLD her she would fix it, did she then do it.  She then totally screwed me, by cancelling my root color at the last moment a week later!  STAY AWAY FROM HER!!!   You wait and wait at every single appointment, and unless you have much time to kill, go somewhere else.  I am much happier since I left, there IS life after Linda @ Hairtique.  AND, they have NO integrity.  I talked to her sister Chris, after the ordeal was over and she offered me a refund, twice!  I still have the voicemail offering it to me,   Linda REFUSED to refund the service, even tho I was inconvenienced for 2 wks and did it at HER convenience.  Do yourself a favor and keep stress to a limit, as well as your time and find anther place to go.  Please note:  I am not the first customer of over 30 yrs who treated her very well that she has done this too.  It is HER way or you are out the door!  There is NO arguing with her BIG ego!  Stay away, far too much drama between the two sisters!"
0,The lady who runs the office is unpleasant and rude. Will not use this garage in the future.
0,"Please don't go here. I'm begging you. I wouldn't wish this place on my own worst enemy. I wouldn't wish this on the girl who cheated on my best friend. This place was a literal nightmare. .\n\nI think I've been to Jimmy Wan's 4 times this month, so I was sick of it. Plus I'd heard good things about TaiPei, so I thought I'd give it a whirl.\n\nThe service was abysmal - my waiter took 10 minutes to recognize I'd sat down. He was very kind, but only dropped my food off. No \""how's it going\"", no water refills, no offer of dessert or other courses. A kind busboy kept refilling my drink. \n\nThe portions are extremely small - I've never seen such tiny sushi rolls in my life. The menu says there's a charge for fried rice instead of white. Huh. Jimmy Wan's offers white and brown, no extra charge. Interesting.\n\nThe atmosphere was atrocious.  A family in the table to my left and in front let their child (6 or 7, mind you) take off his shoes and walk around. He then ground his heel into the carpet - with a piece of chicken in between. He swiped a cloth napkin from an empty table and rubbed it all over his feet. I audibly gasped, but his obese mother couldn't hear me or ignored me. Then she threatened to take each of their Kindles away if they didn't shut up. The boy was eating with salad tongs instead of a fork all night long.\n\nThe waitstaff saw what was happening and didn't care at all. My waiter didn't show up after I was finished with my meal and when he did (after I'd requested someone else get him) he failed to clear my dirty plates. I finally told the owner how terrible the whole thing was - namely the ambiance and the service and she asked if I wanted anything to go and apologized for being busy. You...think I want something to go? How were 15 people in the 50 seat restaurant and one small takeout order. How....is that busy?\n\nOther reviews have mentioned that the ownership has changed hands. If you care about your health, don't go to a restaurant where the waitstaff doesn't care if children grind chicken into the carpet. If they find that behavior outside of the kitchen normal, can you imagine what they do inside the kitchen? I have no doubt little handwashing goes on and much wiping of noses while cooking.\n\nJews, don't go here on Christmas, even if though they loudly advertise they're open. If 15 people means they're \""busy\"", can you imagine what it'll be like on Christmas?\n\nThe slowness of the whole establishment is astounding. I dropped my little brother off at Jimmy Wan's immediately before going to TaiPei - a 15 second drive between establishments. Wan's parking lot was jam packed and he ate with 9 other friends. He called me to pick him up as I was paying the bill. How the hell did TaiPei take as long as Jimmy Wan's did to seat and serve and bill 10 people as they did me, the 15th person in their restaurant?\n\nOnly go here if you have a death wish or are a practicing masochist."
0,"I used to frequent Tai Pei once a week or so, but within the last few years, it has gone severely downhill. The food is greasy, way too expensive, and they use massive amounts of MSG. I got terrible MSG poisoning from Tai Pei and ever since then, have gone to Jimmy Wan's down the road."
0,"We visited with a Groupon last Thursday. \n\nWe ordered the Hot and Sour Seafood Soup, the black bean chicken, szechuan beef, and lamb with scallions. \n\nThe soup was awesome! Very spicy!\n\nThe rest of the food was awful. It was tasteless... the meat had a weird fluffy texture.... there was zero flavor. It was actually so bad that we asked to talk to the manager. \n\nHe said the kitchen would make new dishes. \n\nThey brought three new entrees. They were again completely flavorless, but warmer. I couldn't taste salt or pepper  or garlic or even feel any heat. It was awful. \n\nWe paid and left. \n\nyuck. \n\nI used to go here as a child. I remember the sushi was always good. Maybe that is the thing to order!"
0,"I ordered from this place and the staff was INCREDIBLY rude when they delivered my order. The woman not only rang my doorbell 5 times but she BANGED, and I mean BANGED, on our window of our house without even a second of wait in between. When I opened the door the woman threw my food at me and told me never to order again as she called me TWICE with no answer (my fianc\u00e9 was upstairs sleeping with his phone, but our home is clearly marked and we've never had problems before). I handed her the money and told her I wasn't giving her a tip then and she LOST IT. I closed the door and she walked away. What in the actual heck? You guys lost a customer forever and I'll never recommend you to anyone. That was insanely rude."
0,"They charged me $512 for a single visit with 2 rabbits WITHOUT ANY HEADS-UP - and they most definitely did NOT provide $512 worth of services. I was sick to my stomach when I left. VCA Fox Chapel is a rip off and they provide a disservice to animals and pet owners. \n\nAfter seeing the breakdown of the bill, I could't believe how much they charged. The one rabbit is (per statement vet) not going to get better. Yet, he still drew blood and several yelled codes to the techs. He also drew blood from the other bunny and yelled similar codes to the back. Turns out each of these \""codes\"" he yelled back was a blood test for which they charged about $60 a piece. The one bunny also got 2 injections: 0.3 ml of PenG was $41.72 (mind the fact that I have this bottle of PenG at home because the vet put the other bunny on this medication weeks ago, so he should/ could have remembered that and just let me give the injection at home if that's what they charge for this! And the whole 100 ml bottle was about $8 at the store) and 0.1 ml (yes, a tiny tiny amount) of Metacam for $43.34. The base consultation is $77 for a bunny. \n\nThe office manager later told me that I should have just asked about costs during the visit (and kindly offered to put a note on my file that I am a customer who would like to be informed about costs (of course, there will be no next time)). When I explained that I feel that the vet has a responsibility to keep a pet owner posted when he is about to rack up a hefty bill with a bunch of tests, she said that the vet just wanted to be thorough. I think that the vet or the vet tech knew exactly what kind of charges they were incurring and I am so mad and disappointed that they abused the situation. \nWhen the check-out lady saw how flabbergasted I was, she asked if I told the vet I had money trouble. Money trouble? Because I'm not prepared to pay $512 for a single visit? All I can do at this point is warn other people not to go to the Fox Chapel VCA..."
0,"We went to this place also after seeing it on D,D,and D.\nThis was after the smoking in places that serve food was put in place. We went with my sister and her not even toddler my two children and ... well we get to the location and almost turned around \""its just a bar\"" Defiantly a dive! Took a while to get our food. The bar was loud and smokey! I orderd the perogies since that is why we went there. My son ordered a fish sandwich we orderd a childs spaggetti. some wings and some other things. The fish sandwich was HUGE. biggest i had ever seen.  \n\nThe childs spaggetti was big and was shared with two children My son loved it .. i tasted it because i couldnt belive him. It was good! \n\nTHE PEROIGES ----- BLAND~, soggy, not crisp not buttery ... they were greasy. it tasted like bland mashed potatoes between unseasoned dough. \n\nWe drove well over an hour to eat here. BIG mistake."
0,The food is pretty good especially if you like perogies but good luck getting it. I've been here a few times to see acoustic performances and every time I'm here the waitress spends more time smoking cigarettes at the bar than attending to her tables. 98% of the time I have to go to the bar to get another beer. But damn the perogies are good.
0,"AWFUL!  The hub bub about the decor, well, it's cheap and trashy. The place REEKS of stale cigarette smoke (and this is coming from a smoker) that hits you like a ton of bricks the moment you walk in the door.\n\nOn a whim, we decided to try Bob's Garage for the first time on Saturday, July 13, 2013. The place was all but empty and no one greeted us or told us where to sit, we just kind of stood by the door waiting to get noticed before finally choosing a table on our own. No verbal greeting or acknowledgment of any kind as we stood there. Ordered a glass of wine and beers for my companions. I suddenly felt ill (didn't know at the time, but it was a sudden attack of vertigo), alas, I digress. I felt as if I were going to pass out. Sent one of my companions to get me some water. The waitress came over and said \""Oh, I would have gotten that for you\"" in a very snotty tone, as if we breached some etiquette by NOT asking her for it when she was clearly not attentive. We ordered cheese sticks in case it was low blood sugar, but it was not. They were frozen and certainly not worth the price. The waitress could tell I was having some sort of issue and brought our check over \""in case you need to leave suddenly\""...REALLY? She never asked if I was okay, needed her to call someone, needed help or anything, but was more worried about collecting the bill than a customer's well-being. I will NEVER go back there again. Oh, by the way, 2 draught beers, 1 glass of wine (that I did not even sip) and an order of cheese sticks (frozen and not very good) was almost $22, what a rip off!"
0,I was there for couple of drinks with my friend who was stay a night at the hotel. \nIt was the worst experience i have ever had in a bar in Pittsburgh. When i got there my friend was having dinner at the table and i joined we. I was there only for drinks so i asked the server if i could have a drink but she suggested re restaurant is closed so i will have to get a drink at the bar area. Shortly after that i see her serving other ppl around me in the dinning area and when i asked her about it she told me it was last call and they were also having a drink so it was ok. Honesty it was a weird experience and i wish i could complain to somebody about it being it's such a big chain of hotels. I asked the server If I could talk to the restaurant manager she said sure but the manager never showed up.
0,"Where to start ... First we checked in after trying to park for seemingly forever (we noticed on the way out - that the sign directing you to the parking deck is only posted on the way OUT of the property - not on the way in so when you come in late and it's dark, you'd never see it!  Room was decent - no complaints for the cost.  We went down to the restaurant to get a snack for my daughter and a glass of wine for me... it took FOREVER!    Finally we got our order and were off to bed ... not!\n\nThere was a group in the room next too us who were talking loudly (almost screaming) and it all came through the door...Our mistake was not calling down to complain (which in retrospect we should have but we kept thinking eventually they would go to bed :(  Finally after 3:30 am it died down.\n\nWhen we went to tell the front desk what happened, the girl had this 'deer in the headlights' look and did express regret we had a problem.  I asked if we could receive a discount on our room and she checked with the manager and quickly came back and said no since we didn't call them about the problem :( but they could comp us a breakfast.  I relayed our story from the night and our feelings we didn't want to return (esp when we saw the line at the hostess stand) but took the voucher since it was that or nothing.\n\nThe restaurant was worse for breakfast.  We stood out by the hostess for at least 10 min and couldn't even get the hostess to let us know how long it would be before be seated.  Two other couples and us were all in the same boat. Hostess was totally overwhelmed. Walked back over to the desk and expressed out findings and she asked us to walk back over.  Long / short the line finally disappated quickly and we were finally seated only to find that there was only a buffet ... so the question that begs to be asked - why was there a line to begin with?!   There were tables and servers?  Bad planning and execution?  Why wasn't there a sign indicating that it was buffet or nothing?  \n\nHonestly, if we didn't have the voucher, we wouldn't have stayed after a walk through the buffet area .... The quality was awful... No plates for oatmeal, stale bagels, beyond runny eggs, undercooked sausage and no pancakes or waffles...\n\nOn an ancillary note, the hotel was swarming with middle, high and possibly college teams.  This didn't bother us since we've been on a dozens of these trips with our daughter.  The problem with it was that the management of the hotel seemingly didn't notice that they were totally booked and staff appropriately for the weekend.  \n\nFor $135+ for a room for the both of us - to stay 8:30 pm until 10:00 am - with all the problems we had with the sound control and service...definitely was not worth it.  The night before we were in the Penn State area and stayed at a Super 8 for a 1/3 of the cost and had a great night sleep and decent free breakfast.  \n\nIf we find ourselves back in the area ... would not stay here or recommend it."
0,"This school is a terrible deal for what you pay.  I got my math degree here, and I feel my educations was average at best, so why did I pay twice as much? They don't have rigorous science programs here, and even their beloved pharmacy school seems to be self-serving to artificially inflate graduation rates.\n\n The money does not go to the professors -- many of them are part-time adjuncts who do not earn much, so despite small classrooms, they are burnt out and don't have time to devote to their lesson plans.  I do not support this unethical business practice.  \n\nThe campus itself is garbage, there were cockroaches all through the dorms and food quarters when I was there 2006-2010, the dorms are old and falling apart, there is no campus life to speak of.  \n\nIn general there is just really no reason to come here and pay twice as much money for this garbage school.  I left this school 60k in debt and could have gotten the same or better education elsewhere - I DO NOT recommend this school."
0,I would give Carolina Auto Repair no stars if possible. \nI took my car here for a simple oil change. When I picked my car up and started to drive home my hood flew open and broke my windshield also destroyed my hood.\nJohn (the owner) refused to pay for the damages even though it was clearly his fault. He was very disrespectful to my father and I while lying about who actually did the work on my car.\nWe are now going to sue him for damages.
0,Don't waste your time or money.  My salad had a rotten tomato and a hair (not mine).  My waitress never offered another hairless salad even if I had wanted one.  The broiled flounder wasn't very hot and neither were my steamed veggies.  Both were SO BLAND I could have prepared a better version at home.  My mom had spaghetti with meat sauce and said it was just mediocre.  The owner asked how our meal was when I paid and insisted they use fresh tomatoes.  I'm sure they do but I had to spit mine out.  She discounted our drinks but I'll never be back!

0,"I have been to this location maybe 10 times in the past few years and every time I go through the drive through the order is wrong. No fries, no salad dressing with salad, no fork, and the last straw was at the bottom of my chili bowl it was about a 6in piece of paper. Avoid!!"
0,"All I wanted was a quick burger to take out, and I never got to even order. Sunday night at 7 PM shouldn't be peak dining time, but the drive thru line was 10 cars long. So in to the lobby I went, and waited in line inside rather than out. I waited, and waited, then waited a little more. After 5 minutes without getting closer to the register, I gave up. That was enough for me. In the end, I probably added a year to my life skipping my order anyway."
0,My wife got food poisoning from here. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.....
0,The oysters and scallops where good but not $17 good.  This place is way over priced. If you come here be sure to check the prices before you order and ask if it's extra if you add scallops to to your meal.   Fired oysters and scallops over $17 here.  This will be the last time I come here.
0,Had breakfast here one time and it was very primitive. Coffee was really bad.  I took one drink and trashed it.   Have been told they survive on the burgers.  Will have to try one and update but breakfast is a Not Recommend.
0,Used to be my favorite pizza and sub shop but has really gone down hill the past year or so.  Many have mentioned how their recent visits have been dissapointing.
0,"Wanted something close and my husband suggested Sub Corral so we gave it another shot.  I called in the order and the man/boy that took the order was not friendly at all no thank you just a \""give me 20 minutes\"" and hung up.   The food was AWFUL.  I got the meatball sub and it was nasty (unedible) and the pizza was not good.  I will never go again.  I used to drive 20 minutes to get this pizza but now living in Belmont I will not even drive 5 minutes for it.  So dissapointing."
0,"really wanted a sub. and saw this place driving by on a road trip. thought I would support small business at the same time. but they don't even seem to have SUBS. The food was horrible- I think they served me fries from the day before and they weren't even reheated.  The staff was rediculously unfriendly... it's like the 70s down here still ;-/\nWish I got the WO memo on this place and not wasted my money, just threw that food in the trash, didn't even want my dog to eat it."
0,"Astonished!  Been eating their delivered pizzas for 8 yrs, Good pies~ but this time they made a mistake and wrote down pick up.  Hour later I called, got brash woman (owner!) Who told me it was my mistake~  I asked if they would deliver, but hoped for a fresh pie~  whoa  - absolutely not!  \nWhen I asked how we could compromise,  she said she was deleting the order. Well ok I guess.\nI even called back to speak with manager (that's how I figured out she was owner)  and she absolutely didn't care about my 8 yrs of loyalty.\n\nSad for them, she probably wonders why her little junky restaurant is not very successful~  and I'll tell a hundred Mt holly people about it because communities don't support business owners who do this ~ all of this over a 12 dollar pizza, pretty pathetic huh?\nKelly.

0,"I don't enjoy writing bad reviews, but I love bowling & it'd be nice not to have to travel to Gastonia or Charlotte to bowl. There must be a reason this place is always empty... even with its dirt cheap prices. With that said, I went once a few years ago and vowed never to go back. \n\nThe floors are so oily, I slipped or fell on my walk up every single time!!! I wasn't able to find the 6 lb. ball within the already limited selection. Food is limited and all fried, that's not a good thing either. I couldn't wait to leave, I remember thinking: this place is trying to kill me.\n\nPlease just increase your prices and invest in some upgrades."
0,12/11    Most unreliable WiFi in town. The manager will look you straight in the eye and lie to you about a cut antenna but I've tested with multiple devices and times/dates and know this isn't true.\n\n1/12     STILL the most unreliable WiFi in town! Does zero good to complain. Obvious they could care less.
0,Having people that don't speak English very well taking orders in the drive thru is a recipe for failure.  I always try to double check but feel rushed because of the amount of people behind me. My order is right 50% of the time.

0,"I'm not one to complain, and I am not a picky eater, but that was undoubtedly the worst meal I have ever had. For eggs Benedict that came out over 30 minutes after ordering it, I would've expected it to at least be edible. The hollandaise sauce was sour and had a horrible vinegar taste to it. The only decent part of the meal was the potatoes, which were just roasted with salt and pepper. Definitely will not be returning for food."
0,"Will never come here again!\n\nMy cat has cancer and was experiencing some new symptoms that needed possible ultrasounds. We came to this CVS location because it was after hours and the CVS I usually go to in Matthews wasn't going to have the ultrasound tech as soon as needed, so we drove 30 minutes in the opposite direction to this location in Huntersville.\n\nWhen we walked in around 10PM on a Friday, the place was packed to the brim. All the exam rooms were full and there were about 10 people in the lobby. Okay, so maybe that night we just had bad luck?\n\nNo. Our greeting at the front desk was awful. The secretary didn't even make eye contact with us and acted like we were inconveniencing her. She was appalling and rude. \n\nWe were told we would have to wait at least an hour because they were overly busy, which we understood. After a couple hours, we asked if we could just check our sick kitty into the ICU for the night and leave because we knew she needed overnight supervision.  Well, the secretary didn't even come relay the NO response to us.\n\nLuckily, not all of the staff were as dreadful as the secretary. But we ended up waiting over 5 hours (until 3:30AM), only to be told that they were admitting her into the ICU overnight and running tests (exactly as we requested before). I know the protocol was to have the doctor chat a moment in person before we left, but we felt that common sense wasn't being put to use at this facility."
0,"I brought my dog to Dr Arnold for a initial exam for a torn CCL and to ensure he was ready for surgery. During the visit, Dr. Arnold agreed that it was a torn CCL and then we discussed which surgery to do. We agreed on a surgery and set a date for 3 days after the initial exam. I dropped my dog off at the hospital for his surgery and received a phone call about an hour later from Dr. Arnold. Basically, my dog has an infection and he recommended waiting to do the surgery until the infection was gone. I agreed with him but then was shocked with a $400 vet bill when I picked him up. I felt cheated because I thought the infection should have been something discovered in the initial exam to say he was ready for his surgery. I felt like I should get refunded the money which was only $132 after I was going to spend $3500 total. There reasoning was that it was only a consultation so the doctor didn't really put his hands on him to check him out. My argument to that is that if it is the first time you have ever seen a dog wouldn't you want to check him out thoroughly to make sure there will not be any complications during the surgery. They did agree to refund $40 of the $132 that I felt that they owed me. I have total confidence in Dr Arnold but will not use their services again due to the way they conduct business. There are plenty of great vets around that due surgery. Try somebody else."
0,"Beware of this place. We had a mini-dachshund that had a bleeding ulcer. Test after test after test they were still not sure what was wrong with this young 7 year old dog. Ultimately after about $3400 worth of tests they wanted to operate to see if there was something that they were missing. How much? Another $5000. Unfortunately he had already lost too much blood, so surgery was definitely too risky and they knew that. We would up bringing our pup to another vet for a second opinion and the fix was not as invasive or expensive as CVS. Please bring your animal somewhere else! They will make you go broke and play on your feelings. Very sad that there are people out there taking advantage of per owners. To add to this, we have had other friends and family members that have had similar experiences. So yourself and you pet a favor and don't go to these \""specialists\""."
0,"On multiple occasions they were not able to remove stains from the dresses, pants, etc but they charged me for the items. Not happy. I've decided that im not coming back to this place."
0,"This is the Burger King that corporate forgot. The food is awful (which doesn't help because BK is generally nasty), service is slow, and the ice maker makes a weird slurping sound....like someones in there. This place has such a lousy reputation that the line around the half gas station McDonalds can be wrapped around twice and no one will wait at Burger King. King Nasty!"
0,"Either my English muffin sandwich sat under a hot lamp all morning OR Burger King's kitchen staff just decided to deep fry the whole damn thing.  If that's not enough, the sausage smelled of animal decay.\n\nJust awful."
0,"UGH.\n\nNasty restaurant with nasty food. I can thank BK for ruining my dining plans this past weekend. \n\nSometimes when you have kids, you have to eat somewhere to appease them. I used to only go to BK if I was \""stopped up\"" and needed a release. Well, that's still definitely the case after eating there Friday night since I made intimate friends with my commode both Saturday and Sunday.\n\nThis place is filthy. \n\nThe food is atrocious.\n\nThe employees are miserable (one of the cooks....No. the ONE cook was dressed in street clothes-whatever happened to uniforms?).\n\nYour pal,\nWalter"
0,Zero stars really but that is not an option. After several failed attempts at other dealers i decided to give this place a try to fix some front end noise and shaking on my toyota avalon. First time and 600 dollars later i got new brakes and rotors. Left with car and still had noise and shaking. Called back and Gary the owner told me to return next day. Then it was the drive train and bearings so 2 days and another 1100 dollars later i pick up my car. Low and behold still shaking and return yet again for a 3 rd time and its another thing. Now im 1700 in and almost 3 weeks dealing with this and car still not fixed. So for the 4 th time i called and at this point i just wanted some of my money back. I did not feel it was working out nor should i have to keep returning for the fourth time with the same initial problem. As i tried to explain this is when Gary the owner became hostile and not responsive to my request.  I don't at all see how 2 weeks 3 return trips and 1700 bucks later and you have an attitude with Me? I don't recommend yes they seem nice until you have a problem BEWARE DONT FALL FOR IT
0,Staff made you feel as if they were doing you a favor by waiting on you. Owner on the phone and didn't even acknowledge the customer.  Food was awful. Will never go back
0,It is too bad I can't give this zero stars.  Eat at your own risk!  I had Kung Pao Chicken and got really bad food poisoning.   The chicken was all dark meat and tasted aweful. I will never go back here again.
0,Had their pizza last night for my sons sleepover. None of the kids ate it and complained that it tasted metallic. It was indeed pretty horrible even for $5.99 per medium. We will never go near the place again.
0,"Worst service in the area, by far.   Once we were seated, it took the waitress 25 minutes to make her way to our table to take our drink order.  We finally decided to settle up 45 minutes after placing our order.   The food never made it to our table.   I have eaten at this restaurant before and  the service wasn't so bad.   The food is generally pretty good.  If you want to order Chicken, definitely get it shredded."
0,"Went there last night, great concept, good looking food ... Tasteless and bland."
0,"Stay away. Since my review nearly a year ago, this place has gone from bad to worse. Every order is wrong. The problem exists at both the ordering process in the drive through, but also in the order picking by staff even if the order was right. How sad. This is the worst McDonald's and worst customer service of any restaurant in any category. Here's what to expect:\n\nLong lines\nRude customer service that claim its the customer's fault\nIncorrect orders every time\nCold fries\n\nThis is one of the restaurants I worry about that spits in food that retaliate insteed of fixing problems. They have added convenient waiting stations for your car to park so that they can hopefully match the order with the car. Too bad even then the orders are not right. What's worse? Nothing changes even when they aren't busy. \n\nAvoid this location."
0,"The staff was friendly and helpful. That's the only reason this place gets a star. After 10 hours on the road we stumbled in here thinking, how bad can a Sheraton be? Answer: pretty bad! A huge number of kids were staying here for a soccer tournament. No one appeared to be supervising these children who ran screaming through the lobby and restaurant/bar area for entire evening. Actually they were also running and yelling in and out of elevators and hallways, too! It was a tired person's worst nightmare. The room was clean, but the carpeting was terribly stained and the furniture scratched. The bed was, thankfully, comfortable. Just to finish things off, the bill slipped under the door that night was totally wrong. I'd say, skip this one. You can surely do better!"
0,"Pretty lobby, but had problems with the hotel staff.  We held a meeting there and had no problems with the room, the AV or the catering.  However, as a guest, I would not go back.  \n\nThe lobby is pretty, but the room did have a smell to it.  \n\nThe internet connection in my room was intermittent and when I called, I was told, \""I don't know what you want me to do about it . . \""  She didn't offer any ideas for help and was quite frankly, rude.  I had the same problem on my laptop, iPad and iPhone.  It wasn't me.  \n\nI asked to take a muffin from the restaurant into the meeting room and, at first, they didn't want to let me - at all.  When they did, they charged me for the full buffet.  \n\nOthers in our group had problems as well."
0,"I've been a longtime loyal customer of this place (2005). My husband and I just called to order delivery and the girl that answered the phone hung up on him. When I called back she told me \""that wasn't me, it must've somebody else. \"" When I spoke to the \""manager\"" he said they weren't delivering tonight.  On Super Bowl Sunday.  A wing place.  Not delivering.  Ok. I don't need to spend my money there."
0,"This business has been here for several years, and how its survived I'll never know. The kids that are employed here must get paid next to nothing, cause every time I get up the nerve to try them again, its a whole new crew. Each seems to sass and ignore the customers worse than the last crew did. The wings are good, and I guess its just the fact that there's no competition that they make enough to stay open. This place would kill if the staff just PRETENDED to care about customers. Example: Last time I ordered wings, I knew they would take FOREVER, so I didn't even leave my house for a while. Then when I got there, I was waiting and wanted to pay my bill so I could leave when they got ready. Couldn't do THAT!!!! Had to finish cooking them to release the ticket so she could ring it up. So, they must have waited to start them until I got there, 'cause it was well over ten minutes later when they finally came to the front. (WTF?, WHY CALL AHEAD?????) Then, she was busy helping other people that must not have been able to read a menu, or understand english, and it took several minutes more for her to get my money, so I COULD FINALLY GET MY CARCASS OUT OF THAT PLACE!!!. EVERY time I've been in this place, must be a dozen by now, its been some sort of \""Don't give a flying +++\"" attitude that just insults me to the point I don't want to come back. Presently, I have a STRONG hankering for some of their wings, but it just hasn't been long enough that I'm willing to go back."
0,Ive been a customer for years and i went there today amd my chicken sandwhich i ordered it was completely frozen i took it back and they made me a new one with no sauce on it and it was completely dried out and over cooked. And the guy wanted to argue back. Im never going back.
0,"sick...and not in the way my college roommate use to say \""that's sick! \"" (meaning cool, awesome, sweet, wicked (variation of any of the previous). No this was just gross. \n\nAfter driving across town to two different malls to find a particular dress in my size, I worked up quite the appetite. Hey it's Friday- I'll go for some Americanized Asian...so I ordered the general Tso's with a maki roll ( not sushi- this is what they call their spring rolls), and noodles.\n\nMy noodles were cold...like really cold. The portion was beyond stingy- normally with these kind of take-out restaurants I cannot finish my meal, but their were exactly 11 pieces of chicken 7 of which were teeny-tiny bits... The texture of both meat and noodles was very mushy and overall not so tasty. When I paid with debit the girl at the counter literally handed my receipt and said \""sign-this\"" ...so much for service. I will say it was cheap and the spring roll was edible. \n\nI should have known better than to give into mall food cravings...not worth the calories. But hey on a positive note I did find my dress size at CP Mall!"
0,"Service was terrible!! My sister and I walked in this location and were not even greeted with an hello. As we browsed through the store 2 of the sales associates went in the opposite direction when they saw us coming. On our way out of the store both associates were at the front of the store shouting goodbye. I proceeded to tell them I noticed we were intentionally being ignored, how rude they are, and that discrimination is completely wrong. I also so let them know their actions are the perfect way to get bad reviews for the store.\nMy sister and I are 2 professional women (Chemist/Psychologist) we were surprised to witness this type of treatment from furniture salesmen. But I guess when you walk into this location with the wrong skin color you get no service... 2014MLK Day... Smh"
0,Garden Ridge has just turned into a junky flea market.  GAG !!!
0,"I bought some Halloween lights there a few weeks ago that did not work for, $3.99.  Went back to exchange them for better quality ones without my receipt, they said they could not refund.  I thought that was petty of them to not take them back.  They still got my sale for the better quality ones.  The clerk said she was sorry.  If the management was actually sorry they would have refunded my $3.99 don't you think?"
0,"Is it me or have the prices at Garden Ridge gotten ridiculously high? I admit that I'm more of a seasonal Garden Ridge shopper - Christmas season, but thought I'd go have a look around today...really? Small pressed wood end tables for $149 - $400 for an 8x10' rug? As I looked around more, I realized that most, if not all, of what I'd want could be purchased cheaper at Wal-Mart or Target...and better quality. No wonder the store was empty. There was a sign out front saying that they're planning on revamping the store....I hope that means they'll be sharpening their pencils and cutting those prices or the next sign we'll see out front is For Lease!"
0,"I've been to several Dick's sporting good stores and this one is by far one of the worst. \n\nA few years ago I took my mountain bike to them for a basic service. Upon picking it up I realized that my high end pedals had been switched with some of the ones they use on their floor. I brought this up to the staff's attention who didn't hesitate in saying that I was wrong and they don't do that. I asked to speak to the manager an nobody was there from the management staff. I asked them to go review their security footage and they said they didn't want to do that either. I took this issue up their corporate ladder and all they did was apologized.\n\nI since stopped frequenting them. Sadly due to lack of options from a similar retailer in the areaI had to visit this location again recently, I had a backpack on as I rode there in my motorcycle. I walked in the store and started headed to the department I was needing, I was stopped by a rather unpleasant employee who told me I could not be in the store with a backpack due to recent theft issues. I told her that I had been in other dick's sporting goods and was never made aware of such rule. I also informed her that there was no signage stating that as I walked in the store. She continued to state that I could either give them my backpack or I could leave the store!!!!\n\nI told her that neither option worked and that she could inform her security staff to watch me on camera or have someone follow me around as I did not feel comfortable giving them my backpack which had my valuables in it.\n\nThis brand has high prices and the staff isn't very knowledgeable nor very pleasant. They are definitely missing the point of retail on so many levels it's pathetic.\n\nI wish there were other options of stores similar to them in the area."
0,Maybe I just don't like German food but was very unhappy with all the food I tasted. It could have been what I ordered? I was disappointed with the selection of food as well. I ordered a Chicken Salad Sandwich and it had way too much sauce on it. My husband let me try a bite of his Rueben which was really good. My kid's loved the authenticity of the restaurant which made it worth it to see them so happy. I wouldn't choose to go back but I am guessing it's probably b/c German food isn't my thing.
0,"FREE 60-Day Membership - WARNING.  I got a coupon for a Free 60 day Membership from a Valpak mailing to my house.  My wife had me go there to claim the membership and get some Milk.  BJ's Customer Service informed me that I would have to buy a $40 dollar one year membership that I could get a refund up to one year.  They basically give you the first 60 days free, then 12 additional months for $40, then $50 the next year after that.  They should just state.  The first 14 months are refundable if you decide to cancel.  Seemed a bit complicated to me.  Is this actually a promotion?  It is definitely not 60 days FREE with no questioned asked."
0,"I have been to many red lobsters before and usually enjoy the food. This was the first one that we have had to wait for a seat, although it was not to long. This place seemed overwhelmed with the crowd. The food was not prepared well. The shell of the crab legs were spongy and bent with the crackers. The baked potato was awful and the service was mediocre. I will not be back to this location"
0,Red lobster was not the place to be tonight. Saturday-8/11!!!! The service was horrible. The waiter messed up so bad that we had more free food then we ordered. The appetizer came out after the salad. It seem to be over before it started. It only went down hill from here. I am done with this location. Come on red lobster!!!
0,Terribly ran! We will never be back to this location. Food takes forever and it doesn't come out right. The wait staff is slow and management has no clue.

I will never got there again. they are to serve the customers and they are doing a poor job in doing that. they really don't care about the customers and they need to have the check in hand when they are putting the orders together."

0,"My daughter was 7 months old and she has severe eczema she's been screaming and crying for hours and scratching her herself nonstop it's a bloody mess. One of the nurse was being kinda rude because I overheard the word morphine I called my husband to make sure that they are not giving my baby morphine. He asked to speak to the doctor I asked the nurse if she could speak to him she basically just brush me off saying \""I don't have time to talk to him \"" they got an IV on her and were about to give her doses of Benadryl,Antibiotic and Morphine !!! Both me and my husband strongly disagree because she's a little baby and just because she is screaming her lungs out and has severe skin flares ups does not mean she needs morphine!!!! We were transfer to Levine and the doctor there was also shocked when we told him they were gonna give her morphine."
0,"Terrible treatment.  If you have an emergency do NOT come here.  They have the worst unprofessional staff that is completely unorganized, no sense of urgency, and spend most of their time eating and chatting in the hall.  You will waste 3 hours in the ER bleeding from a head injury and concussion as others keep gerring treatment.  One nurse said \""oh we keep forgetting about you\""  WTF!   Go here to die!"
0,"On my first appointment to buy my wedding dress and to find dresses for my 7 bridesmaids the attention was great and i was in love with the dresses. They promised so many things and made the whole situation sound great. Once my dress arrived and i went to pick it up the staff at the door was rude and they wanted me to sign the paper to pick up my dress without me looking at it first. Once i told them that i wasn't going to sign anything without inspecting my dress first, the women at the front was still rude. Another lady came up to me and told me to pick up my dress and to follow her to the back. Which i was agrevated already for their attitude. Once in the back i was already shaking and very close to cry for this experience. I open the bag where my dress was and i was so dissapointed. My dress was really wrinkle and non of their staff helped me to put on my dress to makr sure it fitted. This was the worst experienced ever and to realize that i brought them bussiness. My dress was very expensive and on top of that i have all 7 bridesmaids bying their dress with them. I will not recommend David's Bridal store in Pineville. Their corporate should train their personnel and increase  their customer service. And of course the person that sold me dress didn't work there anymore....."

0,"I wouldn't even give them one star at this location!! Beware Dr. Jeffrey Musler and Associates optometry group PA!!! This was the worst service and experience I have ever received!!! The ladies at the reception desk are horrible!!!! I called to order contacts and they were utterly confused. Miscommunication across the board. The receptionist said \""maybe\"" they'll go ahead and service me and they might call me back and hung up on me! I was simply trying to order contacts as the doctor told me it would be easy as calling in to do so. Terrible place and I would not recommend this facility to anyone."

0,"Where to begin my review as this will be my 1st and last review for this place.  I will definitely be sending a letter to the corporate office on this place. Upon entering for my families 1st time trying this spot for take out it would be our last.  I was in total shock seeing the cashier handling the register then placing lids on the tartar sauces used for the meals.  At no point was any washing of the hands or using gloves ever attempted, mind you dealing with the register.  As my families meal was brought out, I see a line cook stuffing his face with no gloves on just his bare hands.   I said to myself, this is unsanitary practices being used here.  I then ask another worker to call the managers attention who's behind her and she gets into the \""deer\"" mode, acting as if who's the manager. I finally make eye contact with him as he knew I was right and went to the kitchen to possibly tell the guy stuffing his face, you got caught.  The manager was looking all dirty himself too, no name tag, no indication that he's the manager.  I asked for a full refund, I was not spending my money here.  I then ask for his name which he pulls out his a$$ and says it's \""Mr. Rapport\"".  Well that's the name I'll use when I compile a letter to the corporate office.  Please beware of this place, save your money for a pack of bologna instead."
0,"Be careful when shopping here !  Bought an $8,000+ bed.  Delivered broken !  Are you kidding me - not even inspected prior to delivery.  More interested in sales than checking their product.  Poor attention to detail, poor quality.  When selling expensive products ladies and gentlemen, you need to make sure the product is not broken before delivering - check it in the warehouse - rather simple if you really care. No excuse for discovering a broken product in front of a customer.  Buyer beware with these folks."
0,"First visit: We ordered a pizza from the menu on the wall. The ingredients were olives and tomatoes. When pizza came it was covered in onions, and there were a smattering of small chopped olives and tomatoes..it looked like an onion tart. My kids refused...to eat this. We also had to go get our own tea and water, as our waitress forgot, she never refilled...we did that too.\n\nAnother visit: my daughter wanted to have her birthday dinner there with some friends. We made reservations months in advance and called day before to confirm. They were confused when we got there....didn't acknowledge we were waiting...and finally took us into the dining room. They tried to sit us at a too small booth that had a huge tear in the seat. NO. We finally got our seat at a table that was actually large enough for all of us...service was spotty. \n\non to the food. There is nothing spectacular about anything they serve. It tastes like chef boy rdee, or frozen dinners. Serving family style is nice, but it is akward to go with friends and do this. \n\nLast visit 4 of us went....3 of us were sick for several days after...2 ended up at emergency room for IV...1 went to doctor for phenegren.....we will not be back after that experience for sure!!!"

0,"I hate to do this...I just hate to...but I have never experienced this before. I don't know if I can ever return to Buca. Firstly, I knew there was something wrong with the server when we arrived. She just seemed...off...or high. She was very awkward and kept flirting with my date. Not only that, but she completely ignored me as if I wasn't sitting right there. \n\nTo make matters worse...much worse, our yummy carbonara had a hair in it. A nice long blonde hair. I was done. I pulled it out and showed my date, he looked at it and told me to just get rid of it. Ok, I did, and I stopped eating. He kept eating lol, until...I found another hair!!!!!!!! Yuck!!!! There is nothing worse than someone else's hair in your food. The night was ruined for me, and we both stopped eating, I never speak up when I am unhappy about something. I am just naturally a friendly, non-confrontational girl, but I felt like I had to say something! No one should have to eat food with hair in it, and have to pay $19 for it. \n\nAlas, my date didn't want to make things more awkward since  out server seemed to be on the verge of an emotional breakdown. So, I kept quiet against my better judgement. She later returned with the check, which was wrong, and claimed that she would have to pay the difference out of her pocket if she tried to change it. Confused! Then she asked us to do the survey and give her 5 stars. Ha! I just started laughing, I was sure this entire night was a joke. \n\nShe literally said, as she knelt down to our table and clasped her hands as if in prayer (I couldn't make this up guys) I'm new here, could you please give me 5 stars, for the good of humanity, and for all those people without jobs in the world.) This was entertaining. Then, she proceeded to take my dates credit card and flirt with him some more! She touched his chest and asked if he had any brothers. Holy...cannoli... get me out of here! I was happy to leave, and planned to never return. That woman just creeped me out. Sorry Buca, a previous visit was much better than this one."

Then went to order gnocchi waiter brand new says they don't have ordered a Guinness beer says we have it be right back comes back like 15 minutes later to tell me they don't have.this place used to be good boy did it go down hill ! So disappointed !
0,"They had 3 hostess up front doing nothing and didn't even greet us. Booked reservation for 17 and she tried to cram us on 3 tables. We had no space to move elbows. Why would you even try to seat us like that? Reason I book reservation is to have enough seats ahead of time. \n\nWhen I walk up front ask host if I can get a bigger table. She gave me an attitude. And was like \""sure\"". Never got a apology for cramming us into a small table. The place is a family style with big dishes. The way they had us seated we wouldn't been able too move to grab our food. Terrible customer service and it was my birthday. Disappointment. Will never return to the restaurant."

DISGUSTING! Worst Italian food ever! They shouldn't even call it Italian food. It tastes like a frozen lean cuisine. The bread was even bad. Overpriced! Don't waste your time and money going here. \n\nThis place really should receive a total of negative stars but yelp wouldn't let us post.   Sad
0,"I was less than impressed. The meatballs were greasy and very bland. The price was extremely high for food that was bland and not impressive. Based on the reviews I was excited to try, but I will stick to Olive Garden or even Stouffers lasagna."
0,Unless you have no other choice do not shop here.  The store is horribly dirty and the prices are higher then Harris Teeter.  If you come after 10 you can hang out with the manager smoking outside (That's where he always is) or you can buy out of date bakery products.  If you question my review take a moment to go visit the men's bathroom.  It is disgusting and can be smelled 10 feet before you even get to the door.
0,Seriously I waited in the drive thru for like 10 minutes. Finally I actually called the store and asked if there was a problem. The manager was like no why? So I explained that we had all been sitting there for forever and I was trapped in the drive thru and couldn't get out and could he please start taking orders. His response was oh sorry I accidentally turned my headset off go ahead with your order. (I was 3 cars away).  Anyways I got my usual cantina bowl and it was okay... not great even by Taco Bell standards.
0,"Ah yes...time again for some new living room furniture.  After getting new sofas every couple of years, we decided to give some leather furniture a try.\n\nWe found a couple of beautiful pieces and got a quote from our salesperson, Jeff.  We thanked him and went to check out some competitors' options to compare.  I'm not a huge fan of the all-day shopping events, and my preference was for the Haverty's pieces, so I decided to go back and see if Jeff could knock off the shipping charges to keep the price around 3 grand.\n\nHe looked incredibly annoyed (and why wouldn't he...it eats into his commission).  He had to \""speak with someone\"" about getting the price down.  He also asked if I would buy today if he could get the price of the shipping knocked off.  Which of course, led to my belief that I'd be pulling out my wallet in a couple of minutes.\n\nHere's where my decision to find a new store, or at the very least, work with another salesperson comes into play.  When speaking with Jeff, I expressed that I wanted to stay around or under 3 grand to stay within my budget...that...and...my wife wasn't exactly thrilled about purchasing a leather set to begin with.\n\nAnnoyed that I was asking for \""free shipping\"" ($120) on a $3,000 purchase, Jeff decides that the best thing to tell me...is...that I should have been looking at furniture I can afford.  Did he really just say that?  There's no way I heard that, right?\n\nNow there's two sides to me...the one that could have handed him my business card and discussed the difference between the words \""budget\"" and \""afford,\"" and the one that was in total shock as he walked away to talk to a manager.\n\nWhile my nature tends to lean towards the former, I was certain that any discussion past this point would have been a waste of breath.\n\nTo be fair, i was already receiving a $100 discount for every thousand I spent (not including the $300 warranty).  Since the price only came to $2700 without taxes and warranty, it would only be $200 off. \n\nI walked in to speak with Jeff for a deal on shipping.  I was prepared to leave and buy elsewhere if he was unwilling to negotiate.  \n\nThe only reason I'm updating my review is to bring light to a poor choice of how to speak to a customer and an unwillingness to be flexible.  \n\nProfit margin is considerably higher in the furniture business than in most other retail outlets.  As a returning customer I expect some flexibility in maintaining the relationship.  Acting like the $120 delivery charge would bring the net profit below all costs was absurd...and if it's not absurd...Haverty's business model must be."
0,"We like Longhorn, but not this location.  The service here is mediocre at best.  Tonight it took 10 minutes to order drinkes at the bar, 10 more minutes to get them and 10 minutes when we had to pay to go to our table.  When we go to the table, it was not ready for us to sit and we had to wait until cleanup was finished. When we eventually got the appetizer the bread, there were no plates around.  10 more minutes to get plates.\n\nWhen the food finally arrived, there was only a passing similarity between the menu pictures and what we received. My Caesar salad was sour and otherwise bland.\n\nWorst experience in a long time."
0,"I wouldn't be so quick to hand out only one star, but after much consideration, I can't give this place any more. My wife and I went on a Thursday night. The place was less than half full, yet the hostess had us wait between 5-10 minutes for them to clean a table before seating us. Seems kind of asinine when there are plenty of empty seats throughout the restaurant. I understand that due to staffing they may have wanted to sit us in a particular server's section, but I believe customer service is all about perception. Our waitress did not seem very enthusiastic.\n\nThe food was a mixed bag. My wife enjoyed her LongHorn Salmon, but my Renegade Top Sirloin was ruined by being served completely drenched in oil. I've eaten at Longhorn in Maine a couple of times, and don't remember their steaks being served this way. If this is normal here, then I much prefer the steaks at Texas Roadhouse for this price range. My lobster tail was good, and not overcooked. For dessert, my wife and I shared a Caramel Apple Goldrush. This was most excellent, and almost warranted an extra star.\n\nThe main reason for the one star is what happened after our visit. I had left a $10 cash tip, and filled out the credit card slip to reflect this. A few days later, when the charge showed up on my credit card statement, I found that an additional $10 had been added. I immediately went back to the restaurant and spoke very cordially with a manager, showing him the receipt for my visit and my credit card statement. Everyone makes mistakes, but it's how a business handles a customer after a mistake is made that sets the tone for future business. The first thing he did, after researching the error in the back, is offer a $10 coupon. That is not acceptable to me, because to take advantage of this, I'd have to eat here again. He asked me what he should do (isn't HE the manager?), and I suggested that he credit the overcharge back to my card, or void/refund the full amount, and recharge it. I was told that I'd have to fill out a form that would have to be faxed to corporate, then I'd have to wait an unknown number of days to see the amount credited back to my card. I understand that there may be corporate policies that he has to follow, but there seemed to be very little compassion or empathy on his part. He should have still offered the coupon or maybe a comp'd entr\u00e9e for the trouble of driving all the way back to the store because of a pretty significant error one of their employees made. No such luck. I would not have necessarily accepted the offer, but the gesture would definitely be appreciated and goes a long way towards a customers' perceptions about how important they are to a business. I do have a background in customer service management, and this would have never flown under my watch.\n\nMy wife and I have never been disappointed at Texas Roadhouse in Matthews, where the staff has always been enthusiastic and the food is exactly what we expect at this style of restaurant. I guess we'll stick with that when we're in the mood for a slab of beef and all the fixin's."
0,"Let me preface this by saying I only came here because I was given a gift card. After reading the reviews I was less than excited, but hell, it was going to be free! \nGot to the restaurant around 4:45 for an early dinner. Walked in, there were about 5 parties sitting in a very full waiting room. No employee visible, the hostess stand deserted. The only employee I could see in the entire restaurant was the bartender!\nAfter waiting for about 5, a girl came up, and asked how many in our party. I responded \""two of us, but is there a wait??\"" She responds, \""yes at least 10-15 minutes\"".\nAt this point I look around the restaurant, way more empty tables then full. Like David K stated, I understand the shifts and seating requirements in a restaurant, but customer service and perception is always #1. \n\nNeedless to say, I walked out before we were seated, fearing what could come of this experience. From the other reviews it seems I didn't miss anything. Seems it all boils down to poor management. It is not the employees fault if the manager has no clue how to run a business."
0,"The meal was good.  The usual, chain steakhouse quality. ... except the 18 oz rib eye came with a 5 oz bone in it.....Typically the servers are at least attentive at the longhorn.  Today our server would have preferred she didn't have people to wait on.  The restaurant wasn't busy but getting a new drink was almost impossible....and you better be satisfied with the old mug cause getting a new frosty mug with the 2nd beer was not going to happen."
0,"I would not recommend going to this Best Buy location. I recently purchased a big screen tv there and had the worst experience a consumer could have. I originally found a tv at their Rivergate location and they did not have any in stock so I went to Pinevill. When I arrived I was one of maybe four people in the store and no one would assist me. After waiting for twenty minutes I went to customer service where I waited another five minutes. Then customer service wouldnt help me. I knew the tv, model number and every other information and they still would not help. So they said they had to page  someone. After waiting another five to ten minutes someone finally came. Lets put it this way..... he treated me like I cut his break short or whatever he was doing out back. He barely said only one word to me, put the tv in the computer, rang me up and thats it. The only time he was slightly pleasant was when he tried to upsell me and I politely said no thank you. Then he went back to his original way. He handed me a receipt and said go up front to the guy in the blue shirt, and walked away. No thank you or thanks for you patience. So i went up front and waited for another few minutes for help. The guy from up front arrived, gave him my receipt and then waited another 20 minutes for the tv. Guess who brought it out.... the original guy. He put the tv in my truck turned around and walked away. Again, no thank you, have a nice day, nothing..... My question is if he walked away from me as soon as I purchased it and went to the back, why did it take 20 minutes to get the tv. He knew the guy in the front would be calling it in. I also am baffled  in this economy a consumer who is buying an expensive product at a store is not even mildly appreciated. I am the last one to usually complain about service because we all have our bad days but this store in whole must of had a bad day. I really have to blame it on management. I seriously had to bite my tongue on this one. The Rivergate location was wonderful however, they just unfortunately did not have the tv I wanted in stock."
0,"Absolutely horrible customer service!  The worst Best Buy I have ever visited.  My family shops at Best Buy from Wilmington to Johnson City and this is by far the worst place we have ever been.  I don't usually write these but they irratated me to no end not once, not twice but three times.  It started last year when I purchased a new laptop to replace my 4 yr old one (which I also bought at Best Buy).  The Geek squad did not listen to my concerns and wiped my old laptop clean WITHOUT contacting me as they stated they would.  I lost a lot of important information!  Then stating that both my computers were ready (while contacting the wrong person over and over again).  When we went to pick them up they were not ready, and this happened 3 times.  Back and forth a total waste of time. THEN guess what happens a year later, THE SAME THING!! After having to wait for 45 mins for them to even find me in their system (I had spent the extra money on the one year plan-which they magically couldn't find 6 months later).  Still no contact to pick up my computer 7 days later, after they stated it was ready and guess what happened after i drove out of my way, it wasn't! Their response \""Oh, huh I don't know what happened there!\"" not even an apology. Called again 3 days later to check and oh all of a sudden it was ready just that second.  Only to find out that it wasn't installed properly BY THE GEEK SQUAD to begin with which is why it messed up. Total lack of respect for customers and total idiots that obviously cannot read directions and dial a phone number correctly!"
0,"Bought an item from there, didn't notice it was an open item until i checked out. Took it back 5 days later because one of the buttons didn't work, and they refuse to take it back claiming i dropped and damaged it. I never dropped it, i brought it back to them in the same condition they sold it to me as.  Then the manager told me we would not have sold one in the condition. But they sure sold it to me. BUYER BEWARE."

0,"Gave this mall yet another try again today, disappointed again.  Easily second fiddle to any other mall in the area.  All the regular stores, plus some of the more trashy ones.  And watch out for the security nazis, same jerk came by twice in 6 min to tell my 3 kids to calm down, and we were outside the mall!?!  I figured outside was the best place for my kids to run & play while we waited for the stores to open.  Will continue to go to SouthPark of all my mall needs."
0,"I've been to a number of Olive Gardens across the country and this one by far has me most unimpressed of all. \n\nOur server, Derek A. (tall, bald guy), was hopeless to say the least. He didn't mention any specials, didn't get us our drink refills in time and never offered any additional bread sticks or salad. Finally waited forever to ask for a to-go box and our check, only to hear him whine to another person right behind us about how he can't seem to catch a break and how he can't even pronounce my name. Ahem, ok, but don't say it right in front of the customer?? :)\n\nFood portions were great and entrees were yummy, but breaksticks were not warm as we've come to expect from Olive Gardens. And did I mention that we didn't get any extra? :D\n\nAnyways, horrible experience. Maybe he was having an off day, but I'd suggest asking to be waited by someone else (everyone else seemed wonderful!) and I believe your server's attitude is directly proportional to your dining experience."
0,"Went here becuase my in-laws wanted to try it out. Not a big fan of Olive Garden but you can't go wrong with their food. \n\nWe went on a weekend so it was busy. The table they sat us at, smelled so badly!!! I did not even want to put my purse down. The area smelled like throw up or smelly feet. This made my food experience not good. \n\nThe place is just older and needs some renovations. Please change your carpets!"
0,"Most people are aware that OG is far far from authentic...however it seems that OG has gone downhill in recent years, and has left it up to a marketing team to save them. Upon our most recent visit to this OG in Pineville, They gave me food poisoning. Having worked in the restaurant business for 15 years, I am very aware of what food poisoning is and is not. This was the real deal..my first hint should have been at the restaurant when the couple seated next us were complaining about their food. I doubt we'll ever be back."
0,"Until recently, I worked near the mall and a couple of weeks ago my wife and daughter decided to surprise me at work for a family lunch date and this OG was selected.  Biggest mistake ... ever.\n\nThe only positive part of the visit was the host/hostess station, who had their act together enough to seat us with minimal wait.  We then sat at the table for15 minutes before anyone resembling a waiter appeared.  When our waiter approached our table, he set down two menus and walked away without saying a single word or acknowledging us in any way.  We then waited another 10 minutes before he returned to take our drink AND meal order.\n\nAt this point, we were both upset but decided to give them a pass since it was a busy lunch rush on a Friday.  My wife and I both ordered coke and decided to get the all you can eat three pasta promotion and asked for our garlic bread and salad to be brought out before the meal.  \n\nWe then did not see our waiter again for 30 minutes when he appeared carrying our entire meal out on one tray - drinks and pasta - without salad or bread sticks.  We were visibly upset at this point, my lunch hour was now over, and we were just now getting our incomplete first round of our \""all you can eat\"" order.\n\nHe literally put the food down on the edge of the table without asking us who had which dish and disappeared again.  My wife had ordered the fettuccine Alfredo for her first dish. I am not exaggerating when I say that what she was brought was a bowl of cold linguini noodles with a glubbed-on ball of cold Alfredo sauce sitting in the center on top of the noodles.\n\nI never request to see the manager when the service is this poor because management is always the problem.  Incompetent management breeds the hiring of incompetent wait staff, so rather than make a scene I simply leave the restaurant.  If they care to stop me to try to insist I pay, well then game on.  No one stopped me.\n\nI returned to work with an empty stomach and placed yet another restaurant on my black list.  And we never did receive our salad and bread.\n\nOlive Garden - your food is not that good to begin with.  If you wish to stay in business, I suggest you visit stores for quality checks on a much more frequent basis - especially this location.  Just dreadfully awful.\n\nCheers!"
0,"This place was disgusting!!! I ate here yesterday around 6. I usually love Olive Garden but the last 2times I've been here was nasty. The outside is dirty, front entrance littered with cigarette butts. There is a stinch as soon as you open the door. The food was gross, greasy and very bad. I gave it one star because of the waiter.  I'll never go to this one ever again. The health inspector needs to visit and manager fired!!"

0,"I received a free entree coupon for my birthday from Tony Roma's, so I used to it to get some takeout since I am alone this week and my husband is gone on a business trip. Otherwise I would have brought him with me and we could have dined in! \nI'd never eaten here before, so I thought it would be great to give their food a test run.\n\nThe girl who brought my food out, (hostess I assume by outfit) walked over with a straight face and asked me if my name was the one on the to go order. It was. She handed me the food and still with a straight, almost unfriendly face asked for the coupon. I handed it to her and gave her a tip also. I always tip, even on free food! I was a server for 2 years at Red Lobster. She didn't smile once and gave off a very unfriendly, almost hostile vibe. Really made me sad. She made me feel like crap for using the coupon that the company sent me!! And I gave her a tip!! Its not like she got nothing out of it!\nI ordered the steakhouse burger (was craving a yummy burger since Im pregnant) and fries. The fries were bad. Not crispy but chewy and not very salty. The burger was pretty yummy, but was slopped in the box carelessly. :/ \nDoesn't seem like good customer service. This was my test run, and I know not to go back and take my husband now."
0,"I am all for supporting local small businesses in my communi, butafter having one of my $50 dress shirts sliced in the same two spots on each sleeve by Starmount cleaners i would never return. The owner is very rude, denied damaging my shirt and tried telling me the shirt wore out. Obviously they are dishonest, and are not concerned with long term customer satisfaction. Further, they do their own dry cleaning in-house and do not do as good of a job as the ones who send it out. Avoid this place at all costs. If they damage or loose your items they will leave you out to dry, literally."
0,"I stopped in to get a serpentine belt replaced that I had in hand.  It broke on my lunch hour so I went to AutoZone and bought one.  I how long it would be to get to it and how long it would take.  They said they could get to it \""right now\"" and it shouldn't take long.  30 minutes later they pulled it in the shop.  1 hour later it was completed.  They tried to charge me $212 for 2 hours of labor.  I asked how could it take 2 hours when it was only the shop for 1 hour and I was there for 1.5 hours.  They then corrected it and charged me a flat fee of $99.07.  If this is their generic price for 1 hour of labor it is ridiculous.  It shouldn't have take an hour to do it anyway.  This is the first and last time I will visit here.  They also pulled my car in front and left it running while the bill was being discussed.  I am very unhappy with their service and will let everyone I come in contact with.\n\nUpdate.  The owner called me to apologize. He asked me to call back and get a full refund.  He also had a free oil change put on my account.  I called to get the refund.  I probably won't be back.  It's not convienent for me.  I only stopped because I needed ta repair that day and they were close.\n\nThis occured on 9/27/2011."
0,"I wish it were possible to give a business 0 stars because this auto repair facility committed several cardinal sins today and are not trustworthy. \n\n(Background: I am a young female who has had plenty of trouble with being treated unfairly in the auto repair world. It is my pet peeve. It is wrong. And you - mechanics - should feel ashamed for taking advantage of women car owners because you think you can.)\n\nI went to Treadquarters today for help after I noticed a screw had punctured my tire earlier this morning. The tire wasn't deflated yet and the screw was deeply embedded in the tread. I needed a patch so I could go on about my day. When I looked Treadquarters up online they were advertising \""Free Tire Repair\"" with some exclusions, none of which applied to me. This coupon, paired with their good reviews, made it an easy decision to stop by. \n\nThe young man who greeted me seemed a little turned off by my coupon. I'm assuming this company offers such incentives so that customers will bring them other business that creates better revenue. A smart strategy. However, it doesn't work if your employees are begrudging and dishonest. He went out to my car to look at the damage and proceeded to feed me some bullsh*t about the screw being too close to the side wall. The screw was definitively NOT in the side wall or anywhere near it, no matter how many times he tried to show me with his \""thumb measurement\"". It was only about an inch away from the mid-line of tire. Regardless, this young man said it couldn't be patched and that I needed to buy a new tire. I didn't argue because I knew differently since my dad works on cars and I had already sent him a picture of the situation. I thanked the jerk for his time and drove off. \n\nA few miles down the road, I stopped at Woodies. I told the front desk guy there about my situation and he said they would take a look. My tire was patched and I was back on the road in 30 minutes. I will be doing a separate review for the great service I received at Woodies. \n\nThis type of treatment is inexcusable and I have no qualms with denouncing the entire company until they deal with their dishonest employees.

0,"I went in Treadquarters Pineville 3 weeks ago to get a patch on my tire. Today I was washing my car I noticed a big scratch on my wheel that went the entire way around. In the past I worked at a custom wheel and tire shop and know that the only thing that will cause this type of damage is if the technician does not pull the wheel weight off the wheel when he dismounts or installs the tire after a repair. Now everybody makes mistakes but back at the tire shop I worked at if the technician made a mistake and caused any kind of damage he would inform the customer. This was not the case at Tread Quarters Pineville. When I went back to Treadquarters to show them the damage, the same young man as mentioned in \""(Aaren H)\"" negative review told me that there is no way that this was the cause of the damage and that I probably curbed my wheel.  Are you freaking kidding me??? It seemed as though he took it personally and then told me that he will file a claim. (In which I still have not heard from the company) I will also make note that he told me that this damage does not affect his hourly pay or anything at the shop.  I have never dealt with such poor management in my life.  This sort of treatment is inexcusable and I have no problem letting everyone I know the the poor treatment I received at Treadquarters in Pineville."
0,"I don't like to give out one stars and I don't give them out lightly without an explanation. I was out driving looking for yard sales in the area when we passed this cute little restaurant. I figured it was probably going to be some amazing southern cooking and my heart was craving some delicious buttered pancakes. To my dismay they were done with breakfast once we arrived. Ah well. No big deal.\n\nWe sat at our table and it took a bit for our server to come and talk to us, and there were only a couple people there. I felt as if our being there was an inconvenience and I was pretty bummed since I'd had such high expectations of the place. We ordered Mt. Dew & when they brought it out, it was in a can. So, obviously, no free refills. Ok. That I was even sort of ok with... \n\nWell when our food came out, I ordered the veggie plate, which was 3 sides. A salad with ranch dressing, mashed potatoes and gravy & corn were my meal & my boyfriend ordered the roast beef special that the server swore by. \n\nMy salad came out and it had only lettuce on the plate with a gallon of ranch dressing. No carrots, cheese, onions or anything but it had a slice of tomato that appeared to have mold on it. Gross. I ate a few bites of the lettuce drenched in ranch before I noticed the tomato & then I pushed it aside. My boyfriend tried the roast beef and said it was so chewy he had to grind it against his teeth for awhile to chew it up & it was just bland in general. \n\nI took a bite of the potatoes because at that point I figure it was the best thing I'd be eating at this place. I stuck them in my mouth and wow... they were flavorless. It was seriously like I'd taken a bite of textured air. Really??? So I said nothing and offered a bite to my boyfriend to see what his reaction was because I knew he wouldn't believe me if I told him. \n\nHe took the bite and stopped chewing immediately and looked at me with a questioning look, and said, \""Gross.\"" The corn was good but that was seriously the only thing I could even eat. He ate a portion of his sandwich and left the rest because he just couldn't do it. I was actually a little angry by this point because I can't believe a place that has been around so long could be this terrible. \n\nWhen we got the bill, it was almost $30!!!!! Yeah and those cans of pop we ordered, $1.50 each! Ridiculous. I will never return to this place and if you're driving by I wouldn't recommend it. Really sad about this one."
0,"This place had availability as we were calling everyone, when we got there it has a strong odor, I asked to see where they were keeping her and they said ohh we will get someone to show u. Once the person came and got us and showed us where she was going to be I almost cried with the loudness of the dogs barking giving me a headache as she was shaking I almost wanted to say forget it but we were in a hurry. I felt as go my dog went to doggy hell. The staff was more mindset on other things then telling us about what she would be doing and if they took them out for potty breaks, I'm guessing they just go in their cage, how gross, so that was disappointing. We dropped her off at 4pm on sat and were told we can only pick her up Sunday between 3-6pm and that the first night free but we got charged for two nights?? Wtf? So we ended up paying $37.00 I never received any pic of her and when I asked about it they pretty much ignored me. I liked Ironton boarding as they seem more in tune with saying hi to your furry friend and facility was calm and collective, and only $22 a night and have the friendliest staff that are always happy to see you. Dogs also get some time to run in a huge play area outside. I will NEVER take my dogs to Best friend pet care ever again!!!"

Then they argued with me saying he was he only chocolate lab they had.  Well....one hour later and 3 other labs (I thought mine was the only one!)...they finally found my dog.  I wouldn't recommend this place unless you hate your dog and want to trade him in for another model."
0,"I boarded my dogs here and spent thousands of dollars with this place because of our travel schedule. I  lost a lot of money with my business and couldn't afford to get my dogs. When we called they said no payment, no dogs. Ok, I understand but then they tried to say we had abandoned the dog's. They would not give me the dogs and work out a payment plan. They shipped all 3 of my dogs off and won't say where they are. I understand they wanted their money. They sent us to collections and gave my dogs away and said it was in the contract that we signed that they can do that. They said they have no idea where the dogs are now.  When I say we spent a lot of money with them, it was thousands over time when you are paying for multiple dogs. My issue is if you are going to ship my dogs off you could have given them to me and work something out and they never told me they were shipping the dogs off. They told us after they shipped them off! I had to give one star rating but only because u have to."

Someone there must have given my email as theirs, or the tech mis-typed it.  \n\nDO NOT LET THEM HAVE YOUR EMAIL.. there is no way to get off the list.  I'm now taking actions to report their mis-handling in the case they send any more emails..\n\nIf you get stuck with their emails, contact their admin by searching 'whois ptautocare.com' and getting their email.  \n\nEdit : They claim the link at the bottom will unsubscribe.  I clicked that thing many a time man... been getting emails for years from you, the Honda Dealership nearby, etc etc... FML"
0,Will never go back. Was there 2 hours before closing for an oil change and was turned away because they did not have enough time.  I gladly took my business elsewhere.
0,"Slow, absolutely the worst.  Horrible communication skills and customer service. I wouldn't imagine In million years how inconsiderate people in the auto business could be."
0,There's a reason no one goes here. Service is horrible. Even with only 1 other person in the store the staff acts like their overwhelmed. How this location is still in business is some type of weird paradox. Don't bother to stop. You have been warned.
0,"Ugh...don't waste your time or your money!  I would have given it zero stars but the Mei Fun and the Pepsi were actually decent.  \n\nThe buffet has the typical Chinese fair but the only thing I could come close to suggesting would be the fried shrimp, Mei Fun, and maybe the sweet and sour chicken.  Skip everything else!!!!\n\nDon't even think about eating the sushi.  I was feeling adventurous so I grabbed a few of the sushi rolls that I easily recognized (california, cucumber).  One of them tried to crawl off the plate before I got back to my seat!  The rolls were chewy and just plain gross, makes my stomach turn to think about it.\n\nService was polite and good on the refills.\n\nEnter at your own risk!"
0,"Not very good. Dried out food. Some things cold, when they should be hot. Disappoined overall. Not clean, either. 11.99 per person not worth it."
0,"This place is absolutely filthy. We were here last year and we decided never to go back but we thought we'd give it another try. Went for dinner tonight and was disgusted. There was old dried up rice under the tables against the wall just piled up. Wet napkins were wedged under our booth seats. Under the buffet lights, you can see splatter of food from the last decade. While I was eating, a waitress emptied plates into some bus boy buckets and some fell on the floor and she kicked it under the cart! Tons of garbage and food under these carts. Blech!! Then all the food was cold and hard. Bathroom was a hellhole. No idea why a restaurant owner would keep their place in this way."
0,"I am usually reluctant to complain, but....\nToday I paid $29.99 for \""managers special\"" which included the works.  Poor job.  Carpets poorly vacuumed, exterior of car still had dirt on it, leather seats not cleaned properly, and the console was filled with water.   Armor-all protectant all over the place and not wiped down properly.  Air freshener that smells like urinal cake.  Pleasant staff, but poor quality work."
0,Stay Away!  They damaged my car. If I were you I would not risk taking my car or any other vehicle to auto bell.
0,"Stay away from this AAMCO! They have the worst customer service EVER! \nWe purchased a Groupon to have our tires rotated and a fuel injection service performed, made an appointment and showed up 10 minutes early only to be informed that they were an hour behind. I even called before I went there to see if maybe there was a cancellation so maybe I cold get in and out earlier. The person who answered the phone, Tasha, didn't say anything about them being behind. Had she said so, I would have waited 45 minutes before going there. Turns out I sat there for almost 3 hours! NOT GOOD! Then when it was time for me to check out, she tried to charge me $3.52  for 'shop materials'. Well, I happen to have worked in a shop and a couple of shop towels doesn't cost $3.52. So I picked up my car keys and left. Next I will be contacting Groupon about this shady business."
0,My vehicle was failed state inspection because of a claim I was missing specific emission equipment. So I went to the dealership to pickup the missing parts and the dealership informed me that my vehicle has never had the emissions parts in question.
0,"I used to only take both my vehicles here when it was buffalo Tire, the service was friendly and the work was good... \n\nOverall the attitude you get from these guys at tire kingdom is that you are bothering them if you have a question, and you should just pay them whatever they say with no explanation, they make you feel uncomfortable and unwelcome and are just plain rude.  \n\nSince they've Changed to Tire Kingdom the place has gone WAY down hill.  The last time I went there was for an oil change... \nThe first day (Friday) I showed up around 12 O'clock there were 2 techs standing outside and two cars parked there... I asked the techs if they could do an oil change and he said no come back tomorrow around 9am\nShowed up the second day (Saturday) and the place was packed... after waiting for an hour to get my car in, one of the guys came back and asked where I had my last oil change because they had completely stripped the bolt on the oil pan.  I told them it was done there and showed them the paper work.  Because it was a weekend they could not get the part and asked if I could come back Monday.  I said no problem and asked if I needed an appointment they said no we will get you in just come after 10 because they needed to get the part from the dealer ...\nShowed up Monday around 11 and they had not gotten the part, once I got there they sent someone to get it.... 4 hours or so later (had time to walk to the mall, eat, walk around and get back before my car was pulled in) my oil change was done, then the tech proceeded to tell me that my rear brakes needed to be done and quoted me $780 for that... I didn't get the brakes done there, but I did have to pay full price for my 3 day oil change... $80 and not even one apology for the trouble. (I'm not the type of person to get bent out of shape about stuff I understand these things happen... bottom line is if they had apologized and maybe gave me a discount, especially for a repeat customer then I am sure I would still be getting my cars serviced there).\n\nI took my car to a shop around the corner and they did my brakes for about half the price I was quoted.   \n\nI will never go back here after taking my vehicles here for years, I feel sorry for Tommy he knows what customer service is.  It's a-shame his management and co-workers have no clue.\n\nIf you have a foreign car I would recommend Independence auto around the corner on south blvd they act like they actually appreciate your business and they do a good job"
0,"If I could give 0 stars for this business I would!  Was totally ripped off!!!\nTook my car in to have NC Inspection.  While waiting, I could hear yelling coming from the service area.  After waiting 35-40 minutes the manager,  Will, came out and told me my car did not pass inspection and I needed new tires for it to pass. ( I had already been told by another employee they were fine).  I told Will that and he said \n\""well they won't pass for NC\"". I left without buying tires.  Went around the corner to another place of business and had my car inspected and it passed! No problems with the tires. Later  in the afternoon I received a car from the gentleman that does the state inspections for this Tire Kingdom.  He apologized to me and told me my car was really okay to pass inspection including the tires but his boss, Will, had told him to fail me so I would buy tires.  Inspector refused to fail me since it really was ok and that is what all the yelling I heard from the service area was about. He told me he could not go on knowing that I had been  cheated. He said he had to do what his boss said even though he is the one that is certified to do the inspections- NOT WILL.  Kudos for an honest person there even though the manager is a crook.  I made a complaint to Corporate and have had several conversations with someone \nfrom Corp.  They admitted Will was wrong and should not have done that!   \n\nHOWEVER, Will is still the manager there so BEWARE!  \n\nI was taken advantage of by  this business just so Will could sell some tires.  What does it say about the company that keeps someone like this on as an employee and especially as a manager!!???   \nANOTHER BEWARE- I went on Better Business Bureau  site to file a complaint.  You may want to read about this company on the BBB site before you think about doing business with them."
0,"First time customer 5/10/213.\n\n They are not very through. Went in for an inspection and failed due a broken passenger mirror and weak wipers. I repaired the mirror at another location and they noticed my belts were split and cracking very badly. If it was not for the mirrors, they would have passed me and my car would have been in bad shape later down the road. I'm glad I did not get my oil changed there who knows what would have happened"
0,"Our country club recently hired the building company to install a rather large deck. After it was installed, several boards warped on the railing causing the dowels to fall out (dangerous) and the facia board all the way around warped. After MANY calls and emails they finally had someone show up only to say \""warping isn't covered\"". It arped after one month! They said they would fix it for additional money - $1200. I can promise you these people will NOT stand behind their work and if you can find another retailer/contractor, I highly recommend doing so. Do not do business with these people."
0,"The Pineville Icehouse is geared for hockey only.  The public skate times are too short and too expensive.  I tried renting skates, 3 pairs and no luck.  The first pair had laces that were cobbled together from 2 different skates.  The blades were dull and rounded over like an old butter knife.  The second pair was better, but the left blade was bent to the right at a 10 degree angle making it impossible to skate.  The last pair was a bit better, but wholly unusable.  This wasn't just my experience, this was the experience of all 7 of us in the group.  All the skates had been abused and hadn't seen a sharpener or any maintenance in quite some time.  \n\nWe decided to stick with Extreme Ice in Indian Trail.  It is a bit of a drive, but a professional operation start to finish.  New skates, longer skate times and a pro shop that caters to other skaters, not just hockey."
0,"On Yelp, a 500th review is a milestone.  It's a big deal and for those of us that have written hundreds of reviews, it's a place to talk about a business that has had an impact on our lives  Fairpoint Communications is such a business.  Fairpoint took over Verizon's local phone service in this area recently and this is a review of their ability to deliver.  In a nutshell, it has been a disaster.\n\nFairpoint took over my land line at home and billing was screwed up.  They got the new business when my office moved to Portsmouth.  One day the landlines stopped working and our customers got a message that the number was no longer in service.  When that was fixed, the lines didn't roll over properly.  The billing was never correct.  The internet connection required rebooting the DSL modem up to 15 times a day.  Calls about all of these issues rarely went well.  People were apologetic but problems remained.  Calling about the same problem twice usually resulted in two different answers.  Two different people in my office were reduced to tears.  Most people and companies I know with Fairpoint in New Hampshire and Maine are having similar troubles..\n\nMy company switched carriers recently.  Fairpoint managed to delay the switchover but it ultimately happened.  Someone from the new company was in our office for a few hours and since then, everything has worked perfectly.\n\nTo Fairpoint's management, I can only say that you bit off more than you could chew.  Whoever made this decision was either given bad information or they just didn't care.  I hope you are fined out of existence.\n\nTo New Hampshire's Public Utility Commission, I have to say that I have no idea what you do.  I should review you separately.\n\nI don't generally give out one-star reviews.  This is my 500th review and only my 12th one-star review.  I'm not giving details because all of the billing issues aren't resolved, but I will say that if anyone is looking for a phone company in Northern New England, Fairpoint is not the company you want to go with."
0,"I have lived all over the US and even globally and I can honestly say that in my opinion FairPoint is the WORST telephone company I have ever dealt with. I moved in 11/2009 and they are still holding my credit balance refund hostage. When I called to request information, the company says I need to have a court order or be an attorney to have access to my own account information!? When I pointed out that the latter applies, I was transferred to another department. Even the managers are rude, unkind and argumentative. They don't dispute that they owe me money just that they should actually pay it to me in any kind of a reasonable timeframe. When I had their actual phone and internet service, it was highly unreliable, too and the technicians were almost as \""nice\"" as the customer service people. If you live in an area where you have a choice, exercise that choice and go with a different company!"
0,"If there were a \""zero stars\"" rating, Fairmont would have MORE THAN earned it.\nThis company leveraged itself to the eyebrows to purchase the right to use Verizon's obsolete landline infrastructure; the hedge funds that now own it have steadfastly refused to upgrade that infrastructure, with resulting extended outages for business and residential customer throughout the region.\nWe've had our business DSL line for three years. In that time we haven't had 30 consecutive days of uninterrupted service. Their \""routing issues\"" have been daily, and their customer support structure is dysfunctional: the only thing they seem to have mastered is the \""I'm terribly sorry for you inconvenience\"" portion of their telephone script. \nSince their latest foray into union-busting here it has only become worse. We in Vermont very much hope that our public service regulators will go after this mountain of corporate grift will all guns blazing: we've had enough of southern corporate carpetbaggers making promises they are systemically incapable of delivering on."
0,My 97 year old mother who is blind moved from one room to another and the company said it would take a week to change the phone because it was a holiday.  After the week was up they said the work order was extended a month because they had so much new business.   I escalated the issue.   The said they would get back to me within 48 hours.  No response.  Some company!
0,"I was so surprised as to the level of disappointment I experienced at this spa. My best friend and I (she flew in from NJ for a visit and we planned a girls' day) went to this spa for 1 hour massages, both of us choosing hot stone. We both have experienced this type and other kinds of massages in many different places, NJ, NY, California to name a few.\nHere are my main issues:\n1- we are greeted by a very nice woman who does not understand or speak English. We ask questions and we are answered 'yes' every time. When we asked about the spa pools (are they hot or cold water?) we get a 'yes'. I ask again, are they hot? We get a yes. SHe leaves and we touch the water and both pools are ice cold. We find the hot tub, figure it out ourselves and the jets, which do not move, are facing straight up, therefore making a huge mess and we can't sit in front of the jets to loosen up any muscles. It was a joke.\n2- the hallway from the pools to the locker room is so sterile, I thought I was in a hospital.\n3- my massage, was all about the stones. My very nice therapist added hot stones then removed them over and over again for 50 minutes. SHe didn't massage anything. I kept on waiting for the manipulation to start, thinking she was maybe warming me up and relaxing my muscles and she was going to start the actual massage any second. Then we were done. What the heck?  My friend's massage included an actual massage.\n4- the tranquility room is an open space right off the showers. there is no tranquil anything about this 'room'. No soft lighting, no blankets (I was quite chilly), no anything to make me feel I was in a special place to enjoy my quiet time.\n5- the pleasure of this experience, and i use that term kindly, cost me a whopping $175.  I haven't felt THIS ripped off in a very long time.\nIf you are used to a special experience and you feel you deserve to be pampered and be made to feel good, Do Not Go Here unless you don't care where your money goes."
0,"UPDATE: I mailed a letter to the spa director with our list of complaints. I was surprised when I received a phone call from the director. He wanted to discuss our experience and promised that they were in a transition, updating the spa, etc. He refunded our money and offered us a massage at no cost so that we could be impressed and change our minds about this place. We were looking forward to a great experience, as promised and I fully planned on updating my rating here on Yelp.\n\nSo, I called last week to book our appointments only to find that the director is no longer with the spa. I left a message with the spa manager and after several days she has yet to return my call. I guess the good service left with the director."
0,"I fianc\u00e9 gave me a gift card here for my birthday. I was so excited because I work for a salon and spa so I was wanting to get pampered. I received a body wrap, a massage, a shampoo blow dry and a manicure. The only thing I enjoyed was Brenda who did my body wrap she was awesome! My massage was with tym. He didn't listen to anything I said. I told him I am on my feet all day and I have back problems so I would like him to focus on my back and to please not rub my feet. He did the total opposite. He maybe rubbed my back for 5 minutes ad did my legs and feet for the rest and the time. Then told me one of my legs were shorter than the other and I should get it checked out. I'm sorry but that was so rude he could have tried to say it nicely. The lady who did my blowout was very sweet but my hair was still wet at the roots when I left and the ends of my hair was fizzy. For $40 I expected so expected something a lot better. Lastly I got a manicure I didn't need more than a buff and polish because I get a manicure once a week anyways. But I saw if I got an upgrade from that I could get a massage in that so I did. If I would have known that \""massage\"" would have just been putting lotion on my hands I would have not paid the extra. The ladies at the mall do a better job. Needless to say I am extremely displeased with my services here. (Besides Brenda) Maybe because I am a service provider myself so my exceptions are high. But next time I pay $420 somewhere I'll make sure it's not here."
0,"It takes a lot for me to give a nasty review, and this place earns it.\n\nI was in town for a mini reunion - 4 of my friends from all over the US met here to catch up (after 20 years!).  I have lived all over the world, and appreciate spa's of all sorts and facilities....and always the main thing comes back to service.\n\nFirst, the greeting here was nice.  We had reservations for our treatments and confirmed at the desk then went on the tour. The facilities are wonderful.  Very posh.  Beautiful pools, indoor and out, and the spa was relaxing and comfortable.\n\nNow with posh places, they can often miss the point of actual \""treatment\"".  But keep in mind I go to a Korean spa in Los Angeles and get an old lady to scrub me down like a little dirty kid so that my skin glows.  Still, I expect the actual treatment.\n\nSo I had a massage.  Can't go wrong with that - right?  Well....maybe you can.  I choose the only man on staff, as I like a strong massage.  I can honestly say that he spent more time adjusting my blanket a million times then he did actually rubbing me.  It was almost annoying.  I was ready to rip the blanket off.  I'm here for a rub down, not fluffy adjustment of the blanket and how it covers me LOL.  So whatever....\n\nWhen I got back I asked my friends if their treatments were nice.  All said \""ok\"" and I had wondered if they just didn't know better or didn't want to complain.  One did complain.  She said that she didn't get the hot oil head treatment.  Oh that's sucky - because it is an add on service and costs a little bit.  But she really wanted it.  Well it's not missing it that pissed me off....it's what the lady told her.  She basically told my friend \""well I totally forgot and I don't have time....but what a shame cuz I do a really good treatment\"".  Well if that isn't the biggest f-you ever?  She should have taken the time to DO it!\n\nThen we go to pay.  Well....now here is the part that totally had me trumped.  Like I said, I've been to spas on every single corner of this earth, and never before have I seen this done.  They basically add a 20% gratuity.  They PRE add it.  Then they say to you \""well, if you feel you want to give them less, we can change it\"".  WOW WOW WOW!  So are you really suppose to feel like an jerk and say they deserve less?  \n\nSo first my friend - she told them to take off the charge for the service she didn't get, then said she did want to tip less since the girl made her feel bad.  They said to her \""well you know the tip get's shared by all of us\"".  Oh my Lord.  \n\nMy turn.  I say to her, well I've never heard of this being done before and it's kinda odd to shove the gratuity down our throats.  We all would have paid it anyhow, but it's the fact that we are demanded to without knowing that leaves a bad taste in our mouths.  I paid and didn't fight.\n\nBut then...there was a local man standing in line waiting to pay too.  He said to the girl...\""what can I bitch about to try to get a discount?\"".  WOW.  Is this really how these locals act?  He didn't know our situation.  He didn't know how we were treated.  So my friend who lives there turned around and said something to him - basically to mind his own business.  The girl behind the counter LAUGHED.\n\nOh no.  In the car, my friend called several times to speak to a manager.  They kept sending her to voicemail. She left two voicemails.  NO call back.\n\nYou can have the prettiest little southern spot and posh trimmings, but the meat is your treatments and your service.  In my booked you failed on both."
0,"Over crowded, loud, and not a relaxing experience. Stayed at the hotel and booked two massages. Was looking forward to a tranquil  environment, sadly that did not happen. The service was below par and did not measure up to the quality of the hotel. I was not told about the facilities available, it was loud, crowded, I was told I could relax after massage with my husband, that did not happen, and checking in was not smooth. Sadly not worth the money or time."
0,I made a reservations for my bf and i at the spa on 6/14/14 to have a relaxing Day but they gave me a stressful week. It was a really nice place. i was planning to go again but not anymore.\nI was very disappointed when i found out that i got charged twice and got 2 overdraft fees because of the spa and the amount was  different compared to the first time being charged also my bf got charged and it was a different amount too. I think this was fraud because they charged our cards different amounts without our authorization. I received a refund a week later from the spa after several disputes.
0,"They took my room number and made a 9 am shuttle appt when I checked in. I come down at 9:00 and the shuttle had already left. Front desk called shuttle and they \""were already at the airport\"". Why make an appt in the first place if you weren't going to keep it? Why take down my room number if you weren't going to call me? So much for. Being a platinum member. Skip these clowns"
0,"Worst service in a Marriot.  My key did not work, went to the office and she did not even check my name!!!!.... Waited for the shuttle around 40 min at the airport.  Not even friendly people working there..."
0,"Scary awful. I needed a room by the airport for an early morning flight. I've always had good experiences in the past so I booked a room.\n\nThe first thing I see when I walk in the door is an angry woman named \""Chrystal\"" (refuses to give a last name) with a look on her face you only see on a bad day at the DMV or on a prison inmate. I think maybe she's having a bad day (or a bad life) so I smile anyway rather than doing what I should have done and headed straight out the door. The angry \""Chrystal\"" just continues to look like she found a turd in her lunchbox. \n\nI let angry Crystal know we are Rewards Members thinking this might soften her belligerent glare. No luck. After an agonizing minute of talking with her, I inform her I'm not happy with my interaction with her and ask for her manager. She denies a manager is available and then gives me the card of someone else who works there but is also not available. I later learn the person who's name she gave me is not the real manager at all. So angry Crystal is a liar on top of dedicating herself to creating misery in others through her toxic attitude. \n\nEmployees like Crystal are no doubt the reason this Marriott has the lowest yelp rating of any Marriott in the State. Whoever does the hiring at this hotel desperately needs basic training. They are asleep at the switch. \n\nIn short, there's a good reason this Marriott location has an extremely low rating."
0,"I would give this place a 0 star if I could! \nKYRA, the front desk customer service agent was very rude and not friendly at all!!\nI told her that I was a Platinum Marriott (1,100,000 points!) rewards member and she seemed to get very Argumentative  and defensive saying no I wasn't, I was only a silver member. I showed her my credit card, license and platinum rewards card and she never entered the number Or my credit card information apparently. (Which I found out after as you'll read below) I went to the room only to find a filthy carpet, lint balls in the bed,  a completely clogged bathroom sink and no extra towels soaps or shampoos in the tub area . They give you one small soap at this hotel! \nI called downstairs to let them know and the woman that answered the phone said that my name wasn't even listed for this room!!  \nApparently KYRA DIDN'T DO HER JOB and not only did not put my platinum rewards card into the computer, she also didn't even put my name or credit card on the room. What she did put in however it was my other  flight crew members credit card paying for both rooms. This cannot happen!!  I will NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN nor will my other crew members!  Unfortunately I was on only a nine hour layover and could not, or did not have the energy to argue with these people. I will make sure to get the word out to have no airline or corporate crews stay at this DUMP OF A HOTEL. I've stayed at some pretty shabby Motels better than this. But you know, with all the hundreds of Marriotts that I've stayed at, there always has to be one bad apple I suppose and Charlotte Courtyard Marriott,, you should be proud of earning the title of being that one bad apple. Between the rudeness. the inaccurate information entered into the computer, the filthiness of the room and the lack of routine maintenance I give this place a zero!! 00000"
0,"Little confused here.. tried to get a hot dog from the cart outside the Fargo last week, when the lady saw me coming (she was on her cell phone) she hid behind the grill and didn't address me, so I walked away and went to another dog stand... is this the way they normally do business with the hot dog cart??"
0,"We booked through Hotwire while in town for a bowl game under their hot rate, so you don't know what hotel you get until after you pay for it.  Let's just say if you like small rooms with a small bed, in a small historical hotel with only apx 65 rooms then this is your place.  They had no king size beds or rooms with two double beds available in the rooms they had left.  Location was decent, but prefer to be closer to the action near more restaurant selection."
0,Bad food. Bug problem. In a neighborhood full of homeless roaming the streets like zombies.
0,"Don't know what the deal was, but on a day with a car show across the street and a basketball game a couple blocks away we were one of about 3 parties which rolled up for lunch only to find the place closed. Who knows how many folks did the same thing considering the posted Saturday hours. Then again about half of Uptown was closed. CLT remains at heart a town by, for, and of bankers. Sad."
0,"I'm with Mike B. I have visited 2 Fox & Hound Bars now (the other up in Huntersville) - both get two thumbs down on the food. \n\nBoth had good beer selection, TVs, and space. \n\nBut the food - no. I got the fish sandwich at the Huntersville location - poor choice. I got the chicken sandwch at the Tryon location - looked like it belonged on the kids menu; and it took 30 minutes, so it was also dry. I initially thought I'd give the place a 2nd chance - 2 for 2 bad food experiences is enough."
0,Simply a bad experience. A group of us came to Charlotte from Cheyenne for a training course and wanted a good local place have dinner and drinks. The place wasn't busy at all and it took 20 minutes from the time we sat down to get out drink order taken and get our beverages. The food took way too long as well and was only lukewarm. I assure you I will not return to this establishment on this trip or any future trips.
0,"This abomination certainly left much to be desired. There was a considearble wait from the ordering of drinks to receiving them, again to order food, and even longer to get our food.\n \nWhen it finally came, they had mixed up who ordered what, wrong sides with the entree, etc. All of our orders, from the 3 steaks to the sampler platter to the mini chili dogs, were lukewarm at best. One of the steaks even managed to taste like they had dropped it into the bottom of the grill. Think smokey, like campfire-smelling clothes smokey, but flavored that way.\n\nThe manager comped a portion of our meals, but the apparent lack of cusomer service and quality control more than overshadowed his attempt to make things right. I refuse to EVER set foot in this sub-par establishment again."
0,Took for ever just to get water and to take our order. We were there for over an hour before we got our food and it was cold. Will not return.
0,"Groupon has allowed me to try new restaurants in places I never knew existed.I Have been to uptown many times and never noticed Fox and Hound. That could also be Rock Bottom Brewery sits across the street and makes this place seem so much smaller. My visit was at 2pm and we experienced some difficulty with parking. It also is DNC week and parking is off limits except for a few places along the street. Luckily we found one after circling 4 times. We walked in and it was awkward. One of those moments that you see in movies where a bar is noisy everyone stops and stares then goes about their business. Normally this isn't an issue but when the waitress and bartender does this its....awkward. We found a booth and sat and waited to be greeted. We waited, looked around and waited some more. Began looking around saw a bartender and that was it. No waitress no one else walking around. Wasn't sure if we should have sat at the bar to be noticed, or like in elementary school raise our hands to have permission to speak. It would have probably made a difference to recieve a smile or simple hello from the person behind the bar, then we probably wouldn't have felt forgotten. After 14 minutes we finally met our waitress who asked us if we needed more time to review the menu. Really? We counted 3 parties, thats it...in a otherwise bare restaurant. Food was good, received it pretty quickly. Our drinks were refilled often without being asked. First impressions really do matter. It wouldn't have mattered from that point if service was perfect. Don't ignore someone intentionally when they obviously know you can see them. From reading other reviews it seems that we aren't the only ones who experienced the same issues. Really felt like we were being intentionally ignored. We did something we  have never done. Intentionally left without leaving a tip. The one person who was polite happened to be the person who was in the next room cleaning. Kinda ironic since she doesn't assist the people actually dining. Will not be back."
0,"We just received the worst service ever I will never come back. Its shocking that on wing special night it was merly 6 tables. One person actually went to the back to fix their own drinks. We had To ask for everything numerous of times. Service was very slow ass and the management was not customer friendly. I personally was not thinking to take pictures of all the screw ups due to all of the complaints the whole table was making. I hated to make so many complaints but I've never experienced such horrible service. It was awful We couldn't find any positive in it. As a matter of fact the waitress didn't even come back to pick up all the checks. It Was 7 of us and 6 ppl got their checks. We told the management We needed to pay another check and that We didn't know why the waitress would leave one out, his response was unprofessional.  :("
0,"Civilized, respectable locations don't charge separate covers for the gander and the goose.  Yes, it's that simple.  \n\nWell, Ri-Ra, I used to be a fan of your Irish authenticity, in terms of a cozy, low-key beer every now and then.  But seems you have taken a turn away from legitimacy, and towards masses of drunken revelrers.  A shame, really, for my once favorite bar in Charlotte."
0,"Over-crowded, nothing special"
0,"Went in to meet some friends who'd come in from out of town.  Lovely place, admittedly - the restoration after the fire is impressive.  When we arrived, the hostess, when she finally quit talking on her phone, couldn't find our reservation and seemed pretty snotty about it.  We went upstairs, found our people, and spent the next two hours trying to get the attention of the bartenders, to little avail.  The music was too loud for conversation.\n\nSummary: VERY noisy, terrible service.  I'd tell you about the food, but the food we ordered never arrived.  Wild dogs couldn't drag me back."
0,"Last time I went it was about 3pm on a weekday and there were 3 guys sitting at the bar Ttalking with a male bartender.  I stood there for approx 5-7 mins before I was even acknowledged.  Needless to say, they haven't gotten any more of my business"
0,"OK, this current rating ONLY applies to the horrific braised short ribs that they unfortunately served me at dinner the other night! Usually, they have pretty solid food, and have a great beer selection. Went there with my work-mates in celebration of a major milestone, and our big boss picked up the tab (which is always nice)!\n\nWe ordered a bunch of appetizers, lots of beer, and then the entrees. Mine was the last to come out, and when it did, I said, \""where's the beef?\"" And I literally meant it. My braised short ribs were ALL BONES! Yes, all bones, with VERY LITTLE meat on them! And what little meat there was, was chewy. As a \""foodie,\"" I am shocked that their Chef would actually serve something like that. I mean, did he think I was an Irish Wolfhound who would gnaw on the bones???\n\nI had to come home to eat something as I was still hungry (not having any meat for this meat-a-tarian is brutal)! I sent their Management a message, but have not yet heard back. I seriously doubt I will hear anything from them, but I felt compelled to tell them that this meal was just AWFUL! Thank GOD for the good beers to drown out my disgust.\n\nDespite my anger at this, RiRa still has the BEST Fish and Chips in Charlotte, and again, a wonderful beer selection. Just know that this one star rating ONLY applies to the beef short ribs dish, and nothing else."
0,"I understand everyplace has its rules. My friends had a pre-wedding party here. And at 10pm it becomes a \"" standing bar\"" only. But did your staff have to be rude to the parents who were still sitting down a little respect goes a long way. We will not be going back."
0,The large employee guy with blonde hair was belligerent and trying to start fights with several us last night. He needs to be fired and needs to be some changes made.
0,"Stopped in after the theater for a pint, but could not get served. We sat down at one of the tables ( more or less stood by it because it needed cleaning) & waited for a server. One did walk by our table to grab the tip from the table behind us, then walked back by our table, but we were invisible. I then asked the bartender if we needed to place our order with her & take it back to the table, but she said servers were on the floor & they would take our order. So, we again waited & never did see a server. We gave up & went elsewhere for our nightcap."
0,"I just went through the line at the sandwich shop in the courtyard of the Hearst Tower.  The sandwich/ salad makers were polite and fast, and the price was reasonable for downtown.  The salad looks like it could be good, but there is no way for me to know because they were out of utensils.   How can a place that makes salads to go be out of utensils?  And the worst part is that you don't know it until you already through the line and have paid.  They should let people know before they pay.  The guy at the register made no apology or attempt to find some way to provide something to eat with.  Now sitting at my desk with a salad that I can't eat, gotta give it one star for the poor service."
0,"This happened a while ago (several months), but it still haunts me today.\n\nI ordered a portabello mushroom burger (I know, not really Irish, but don't judge). When my burger came out, it was not a portabello mushroom patty, but instead, a pile of sliced mushrooms on the bun. I asked the server, why it was not a portabello patty, and the server told me it was because they had run out of portabello patties, and this was what they were using instead. Interesting. I told him I didn't want this, and wanted something else. He obliged, took my plate of sliced mushrooms, and went to place my new order. I called the manager over, to let them know the situation. When I explained my side of the story, he rebutted with something \""Well the server told you we were out of portabello mushroom patties, and said you agreed to sliced mushrooms\"". WHAT?! I told him, no, that was incorrect, and that I was unware of them being out of portabello patties until I was brought a plate of sliced mushrooms on a bun; my wife agreed. The manager stood by his server. I firmly told him again, that I did not know/agree to having a sliced mushroom sandwich, and that the server conveyed no such message of running out of portabellow patties. I asked him how he could rectify the situation - free meal or something? No he would not, because I was aware of the situation (but I wasn't!), although he did comp me the original portabello mushroom burger...gee thanks.\n\nNow I'm not the type of guy who tries to find fault at every little thing to get a free meal. But come on. I would assume, after having worked in the restaurant industry for several years, that the manager, regardless of how much/little he believed the customer (me) would side w/ me, or at least try to rectify the sitatuion for future business. But no, instead, he stuck w/ his server, made an unhappy customer, and now I will not visit there on my own volition (my wife enjoys the place, so I will go back w/ her, only urging)."
0,"Can you say, \""Ug?\"" So, there are lots of TVs and there was the same game on, for all 40 sets. This seemed quite bizarre. Also, why have 4 screens when you can have one huge one? Why advertise fresh squeezed lemonade, when it's from a package? Why give french fries with most of them burned? Why not have a vegetarian burger in addition to all the artery clogging ones? The reason for the one star, was that our waitress was cool and very courteous."
0,"Lack of Atmosphere (Even during sporting events)\n\nFood is terrible.\n\nBartender/Waitress were incredibly rude....\n\nEverybody has bad days, they should not be this bad....."
0,"Found a long black hair in my burger. The buns were cold the meat patty was overcooked (asked for medium) and very thin. The side salad was decent, the tea tasted like crap and the food took foreeeeever to come. The waitress shifted from friendly to rude and then back I was thinking about asking her if she had a evil twin sister or something."
0,"I don't know who of my group picked this place out, but they never owned up to it. \n\nThe service was absolutely terrible.  The waitress was practically all but ignoring us.  We only got offered one round of drinks, never asked if we wanted a second round.  We had to ask for our silverware/napkins after our food came, and did not get it until at least 10 minutes later about halfway through the meal. All the while watching the group of guys next to us get service repeatedly (when they asked her to get something, she would immediately come back to their table, not disappear for 10 minutes then have to be asked again when she did finally return). Aside from just being terrible, she was also unfriendly.  \n\nAs for the food, all my friends seemed to enjoy/appreciate their meals.  For about 8-10$, you get a huge sandwich/burger and a side of fries.  Except $8 for a basket of chip and cheese dip is ridiculously overpriced to me.\n\nAs a vegetarian, it was entirely another matter for me.  Not wanting a \""veggie\"" burger, I ordered the buffalo blue cheese dip + potato wedges/chips + vegetables off the appetizer menu.  What was delivered was a basket of chips and cheese dip. When I asked the waitress if I was correct that the menu listed vegetables as well, she said \""yeah, it should come with it\"" as if I was asking too much for the kitchen to produce what the menu says.  It wasn't actually until I explained the vegetable part was the reason I ordered this dish that she \""offered\"" to get them for me.  She disappears. Ten minutes later, my friends halfway through their meal, no vegetables in sight, but at least we have silverware and napkins now.  Five minutes later, she hears us loudly complaining, and says shes told the kitchen twice now.. yeah right. Another ten minutes later, we're complaining real loud now, to ourselves because no staff member is in sight.  Soon the manager appears and says the vegetables will be out soon and apologizes.  My cheese dip and potato chips are not semi-warm, at best. He returns, and in a pretentiously apologetic manner sets done a plate and gets ready to scurry off before I can complain about: THREE 6-inch cuts of celery, and TWO 4-inch by 1-inch hunks of a carrot, completely RAW.  It took them 25 minutes to bring this out to me, and then act as if this would suffice without any compensation.  We immediately asked for a box and a discount. \n\nYes, he discounted us 10% of our final bill, which I think came out to deducting my cheese dip and chips, plus half of my beer.  The waitress brought it out as one check too, not asking if us 2 men and 2 women (obviously 2 couples), would have wanted the check split.\n\nThe kicker: the sidewalk sign outside their door read \""Charlotte's Finest\"" ... Methinks not."
0,"Went in for a couple drinks and food. It was so slow that I actually asked one of the employees if they were closing. With that being said, drinks came out pretty fast but that was it... waited about 15 minutes for the bartender to take our order which we cashed out and moved on to another place to eat. There were more employees in the restaurant than guests, and ironically there were a couple of them enjoying a meal, at a table in the Dining room, in front of customers who couldn't even order an appetizer in a reasonable time. No management present that we could see. Seems like a place that has given up."
0,"I booked this hotel for the 2014 ACC Championship game. I thought that this hotel, as a host hotel for the game, would offer options for dinner after the game. Wow, I was wrong. We got back around midnight to a line st the only open restaurant where we heard last call was most likely before we could sit down. We decided to try room service... What a mistake. I called the front desk and was told they stopped room service at 11. Wow, 11 closure on a night when they knew most guest would not get back until later. I talked to the duty manager and he was no help at all. His answer was to order pizza. I found all of this very unacceptable. I'm a Platinum Member of the Marriott Rewards program, but I can say I will not stay here again after the lack of preparation they had for game that started at 8:00 pm."
0,"I don't trust Eden Cleaners. \n\nI used their online service to pick up my laundry. For three days no one called or picked up the clothes. After several calls, I finally spoke to someone. Clothes were picked up and returned. Their service was fine.\n\nWhat bothers the snot out of me is that no one answers the phone as \""Eden Cleaners\"". After they say, \""hello?\"" I have to ask if I've reached Eden cleaners. I can deal with the very broken English, but I can't deal with the non-conventional ways of answering the phone or doing business online.\n\nWhile it's more expensive to have the clothes done at the hotel, at least I know that they'll get done."
0,I went to this cleaner for convenience. What a mistake it was. They absolutely destroyed my favorite dress. It went in perfectly fine and came out pink! The woman told me it was not her problem and that they weren't a magic shop! Absolutely terrible service. I have had the dress cleaned before with absolutely no problem. Use at your own risk.
0,The food was rock bottom. \n\nIt was so disappointing that  me and two my friends could not finish our meals.
0,We went for lunch on Sunday Afternoon.  We sat there for ten minutes and nobody acknowledged us or came to our table.  A waitress passed our table two times and chose not to make eye contact with us.  Servers congregated at the hostess stand.  We walked out and still nobody noticed.  This used to be my favorite place uptown.  Really disappointed.
0,"Bad service and mediocre food served cold.  If you have a large group and want to get together for lunch you would be better off bringing a bag lunch and meeting in a park. \n\n We made reservations but it took 30 minutes for our order to be taken and the food didn't show until an hour later at which point we all had to get back to work. And, the food was cold.\n\nThe kicker is that this  wasn't the first time this has happened.  A few weeks ago we all got exactly the same horrible level of service with cold mediocre food.\n\nIf I could give negative star rating I would."
0,"My girlfriend and I were part of a friend's birthday party of about 12 adults on a Thursday night. It was not especially crowded (no wait) and we had reservations.\n1. Nobody took our drink orders or brought us water for over 20minutes.\n2. When they brought out all the appetizers, ours was not among them, because it was never put in. When it finally came out, it was clear the nachos were rushed and they were not especially good.\n3. When the entree came out, we were brought the incorrect dish, at this point I had more than enough of the place, so I told them to forget about it and bring the check.\n4. Everyone had finished their meals for nearly an hour before the checks were sporadically brought out. After all the checks were brought out, we had to pull the waitress aside and specifically ask for her to bring ours.\n5. During this whole time, there was no one who looked like a manager to be found. Everyone at the table was clearly upset by the service, yet management never showed its face.\n\nThis was, by far, the worst dining experience I have ever been a part of and I would not recommend this overrated establishment to anyone."
0,"First time here , only thing nice about this place is the location. The food from the frozen baked wings , bland Mac and cheese , tasteless stuffed brisket burger , and let's not forget the pepperoni pizza that Sam's food club can do better . This has to be the worse bar food for game watching in Charlotte, NC ."
0,"This place Was horrible!!! The steak was over cooked and tough, the service was so slow that it took us 2 hours to get our food the wine was delivered after 40 minutes. Sure the view is cool but really?? Glad some one else paid or I would be MAD."
0,"This fast food place almost ALWAYS gets my order wrong. They charge me for things that they don't have. The lettuces on the garden salad is always weltered. Besides the staff being EXTREMELY unprofessional, the wait time is always long."
0,"My husband and I went to Presto on a Tuesday night around 6:30. It was very, very bad. Very bad. So very bad that I'm writing my first Yelp review.\n\nSummary: Some of the food was decent, but everything else is so so very very bad that it's not worth it. I will tell people not to go there and I will never go back.\n\n[The BAD.]\n\nThere was one guy playing hostess/waiter/bartender/bus boy, hitherto referred to as HWBBB. \n\nWe went there specifically to sit on the patio because the weather was awesome, but were told we couldn't because the HWBBB was the only one on staff.\n\nThe temperature in the restaurant was HOT. Stifling. Not normal. 70 outside, 85 inside.\n\nThe menu was schizophrenic. I had no idea what to order. Sushi, pitas, pizzas, steak. Plus a \""build a 3-course meal\"" option. I felt like I was reading the menu at Cheesecake Factory. \n\nThey played dance music? Which is just weird in a restaurant setting.\n\nThey were out of several things. I asked the HWBBB, \""What beers do you have on draft?\"" He said, \""We only have 2. We usually have 4 but we ran out of 2 today.\"" So I'm already disappointed and I don't even know what they have yet. My husband ordered a glass of Malbec and the HWBBB came back and said they didn't have it.\n\nMy order was wrong. I ordered a side salad in lieu of fries. I received an entr\u00e9e salad in addition to my meal, which still came with fries. I ordered a chicken kebob sandwich and received a beef kebob sandwich. We decided things were so bad at this point that I didn't tell the HWBBB of his error. I sucked it up and ate the stupid beef.\n\nThe beef was very pink in the middle and was of extremely poor quality. Maybe stew meat. I chewed each piece the point I'd realize it wasn't going to break down any further and then spit out what remained. I'm usually not such a disgusting dining companion but this place brought out the best in me. I kept wishing for a normal chewable digestible piece but ended up eventually spitting out every single piece of beef.\n\nWe had a groupon and when the HWBBB brought the bill we got lectured on all the items the groupon did not apply towards. Like alcohol (fine) and the $20 3 course meal my husband ordered, \""because that's already a deal, but I'll make an exception, just this once.\""\n\nWe settled the bill before the dessert from my husband's meal came. Our HWBBB was puzzled that we were still sitting there and eventually asked what else he could do for us. We asked if he could bring the dessert we ordered. \n\nThe apple crisp was like flour and sugar mixed with 3 apple chunks, stuck in the microwave on high for 10 minutes, topped with ice cream.\n\n[The not so bad.]\n\nThe beef tasted good, even if I couldn't chew it.\n\nMy husband's shawarma was good.\n\nThe tzatziki sauce was very good.\n\nThe pita bread was good.\n\nThe salads were ok.\n\nThe curly fries that came with our meals were reminiscent of Jack 'n' the box, one of many other places I dislike but would rather have eaten at."
0,"Great service, but this is honestly the worst food I have ever eaten out at a restaurant in my life. I dont suggest going here for food EVER (maybe for the drink specials and hookah but nothing else)."
0,"Restaurant dot com you've let me down once again. I've got to ask myself why do I keep doing this. I guess the good restaurants don't have to use coupons. To be fair we ordered the three steak options on the menu, all a huge disappointment. First we must of got the \""sell by this date\"" steaks because its easy to tell what a previously frozen steak tastes like.   Second the New York strip was cut by the first day of culinary school student, coincidence Johnson & Wales is so close, hmm? No offense to Johnson and Wales but every school/university has drop outs. One side was about 3/4 inch, other side an inch, and was cooked to a shoe leather consistency. No excuse for an overcooked steak ever, and all ordered medium rare.\n\nAvoid this place even if free.\n\nOh yeah should of walk out when saw it was also a \""Hookah\"" lounge, seriously?"
0,"I'm simply not a fan of this place and don't plan on going back so let me explain why... \n\nLast fall, before a panthers game I came here and had a pretty decent lunch-I had a tasty buffalo chicken wrap with fries and two Bloody Mary's (yes it was one of those Sundays) and all was good. I left for the game with a decent memory of Presto. \n\nFast forward to the new owners and disappointed is the best word that comes to mind. First, I met a co-worker for a quick lunch, which meant I wasn't hungover or imbibing, so it was a much more objective assessment. I paged through a menu that has a serious identity crisis from mediterranean to American to italian pasta dishes to typical bar food and settled on a chicken gyro sandwich...when in doubt, I always go the specialty cuisine. When it arrived it had tzatziki on the side (good) and some weird, greasy dressing drizzled inside (not good). To make things worse, after my first taste, I almost sent it back to say I ordered chicken, thinking they gave me fish...but them realized the consistency was chicken with a really bad taste. \n\nNonetheless, I ate the pita bread and wilted greens I got for a side salad and split...with a stomach ache to follow.  \n\nI really try to give places more than one try before writing a bad review but you couldn't pay me to go back for another try"
0,Very poor service. Unremarkable at best.
0,Seafood Noodle soup had slices of pork. The cilantro garnish wasn't even chopped.
0,"I absolutely hate this place. Not for the amenities as they are undoubtedly the best in the business, but when you have a problem there is no one to help you. On my last stay I tried for several hours on an off trying to contact someone about the A/C in the room, or just for information about about some of the amenities. No answer. When I did get through to someone I was rudely told that only one person was answering the phones for the entire place. BTW, no one ever showed up to fix the air. \n\nI also have a problem with a place that wants to charge for internet access. Even the mom and pop hotels offer free in-room wifi or wired internet and with what this place charges it should be included. \n\nThe last thing, you get dinged for 18.00 just to park and if you aren't careful they'll double bill you for it if you've prepaid for the room. Parking should also be included in the price of the room and if you want one of those guys at the door to park your car, pay the 25 bucks."
0,"First, let me say that I travel frequently both domestically and internationally and have stayed in a variety of hotels. This is the first time I feel compelled to write a bad review. The hotel rooms were dirty and service was terrible.  Bathroom had hair on the floor and smudges still on the mirror. I left a New Tempur-Pedic pillow in the room and called the hotel to recover it. Each time I was transfered  to the security desk and they requested I call back later and see if housekeeping had turned the pillow in. After about 5 or 6 calls they did say they found the pillow and I had to give my credit card info to get it shipped to me.  It was not my pillow.  I called management and received a curt response that they would refund the shipping charges. (but they have still not done this 3 weeks later). I can only say that this hotel has zero commitment to customer service. I will never stay here again."
0,Don't waste your time staying here if you are a business traveler. The Internet is awful and they don't support iPhone or iPad \n\nSo many better options around
0,"This hotel is so swanky! It looks so cool outside with their chic building design, concierge service, and a lot of the amenities you'd expect from such an establishment. So why the low rating? I'll elaborate!\n\nThe positives? My room on the 25th floor had a pretty cool view. The beds are super comfy and fluffy. The rest of the room is just okay. The room and bath I'll be nice and call cozy. There's free wifi, the ubiquitous minibar with astonishing prices, and a nice breakfast.\n\nHere's the bad points. Staying here treats you to surly employees that don't even look at you when answering a question. I mean seriously why you gotta be so mean to me after I checked out?! I asked if I could get my parking validated since I didn't have a room key to get out for free anymore, and parking is some ridiculous price of about $7 per hour. So preoccupied with his little computer screen he was that he didn't even look at me and waved me off with a we don't validate parking here, pay the machine on your way out. Seriously? I know I look a bit young and my clothes were kinda grungy when I left but the housekeeping when I first got here was nicer to me than you were. At least she made sure I got to where I was going when I was looking a bit lost.\n\nSo I ended up paying the parking fee of $7, but I think I'll be heading to the Ritz Carlton in the future where I'm sure they'll at least treat me with some modicum of respect instead of treating me like I came in off the street begging for some change."
0,"I went to an event lasy night at the Westin Hotel,  its a yearly event that has been hosted at the westin for years.  This year was smaller than the past due I think mostly because people are not happy with the continued issues of under staffing at the bar.  It took about 30 min to get a drink, and once again they ran out of vodka.  I would think because of past experiences with this group they would be better prepared.  There was so much lost revenue, last night because I saw a lot of people including my group that just left and went elsewhere to get a drink.\n\nThe main bathroom off the lobby was one of the most disgusting I have encountered.  one stall was roped off with no toilet at all,  there was  a broken bottle in the other shattered all over the floor, no towels, and one had overflowed.  Wouldnt you think they would have an attendant check on the bathroom on occasion.\n\nMy recemendation is step it up Westin,  I assure you I wont be back unless you do..I hope this group considers another venue, want that wants the business, as it seems the westin is not interested.."
0,"Okay, from a distance this looks like a nice hotel. But Its definitely not worth the money. The pool is made from the same material as a shower in a mobile home. Its long(ish) and not wide, with its deepest point at 4 ft. The other half of the pool is 3 feet, so you can't swim laps unless you want to hit the bottom. The fitness center lacks a fan, so working out gets too hot. The room itself has a nice view but seriously all it is is a bed and a shower. There's nothing all that nice about this $300/night room. There is nothing included: no breakfast, no drinks, a water bottle in the room costs $4, internet for ONE device is $12/day. With that price, Id expect much much more. I feel like I should only be spending maybe $100. The only reason why they get away with this price is because its conveniently located next to the convention center. Otherwise, I will never stay at this place. They nickel and dime you everywhere you turn!"
0,"I can only speak from the experience of staying here for a recent convention. Several conferees and I had issues with the staff during the event over displays and services. Due to the nature of the event (romance novelists and readers) I got the impression they hovered close in case we decided to cause trouble. I did not find the venue pleasant.\n\nWhile my room was clean, I think the bed aggravated my back pain. I also understand a number of conferees who drank the water experienced discomfort and sore throats."
0,"Ehhhh...not so much.\n\nWhile the building, level of service, and rooms were in line with a typical Holiday Inn, the staff and management committed an egregious offense against me - a returning and Priority Club customer.\n\nBrief summary of my horror story - \nWe check in, we get the wrong room.  They move us, give us keys to a filthy room.  We bring that up and leave for the day for them to clean it.\n\nWe get back to the room, and I check my bank account and find a significant amount of money missing - $329.  After spending about an hour on the phone with my bank, we trace the charges to the Holiday Inn I am staying at via the card that I have left for incidentals.\n\nDespite prepaying for the room, we've now given the Holiday Inn about $600 for a two-night stay in a $110 / night room.\n\nFurthermore, the banks had closed so I couldn't transfer more money into my checking account until after the weekend.  It wasn't that I didn't have access to cash, but I had financial fraud to deal with on what was supposed to be a fun weekend with the guys.\n\nWhen I bring it up at the front desk, I am immediately given run around.  They pull up my info on their computer, and gasp as they see their error.  The staff wouldn't take ownership of their mistake, they simply blamed a computer error.  I finally get a manger who says he'll deal with the issue, and I don't receive any further communication, as I'm pretty sure he wasn't planning on working during the weekend.\n\nThe next day of my stay I call the front desk again, and demand answers.  This manager was a bit more assertive in handling the issue.  She spent time on the phone with my bank, and then my bank conferenced me in as we searched for a way to overcome Holiday Inn's costly error.\n\nAfter dealing with this issue for about 5 total hours, it becomes apparent that there is no way my money will be returned until after the weekend.  I demand to only pay half of my hotel bill, which is immediately granted.  By then I was tired of dealing with the issue and took their bill reduction as adequate compensation.\n\nUltimately, don't use a debit card to pay for incidentals on a hotel room, because hotel systems may automatically withdraw an egregious amount of funds from your account, which could cash screw you for the weekend.  \n\nAlso, DON'T STAY AT HOLIDAY INNS because the staff and management is comprised of lazy, lying, and incompetent thieves.\n\nThat is all."
0,"Quite possibly the most miserable hotel experience of my life. noisy, dirty, poorly renovated and the WORST customer service known to man. The way I was treated by the front desk was enough reason to never step foot within a mile radias of this place. Doesn't even deserve one star in my book. \n\nAVOID AT ALL COSTS!"
0,AWFUL!! i booked a hotel room here for New Years Eve and was not told that it was a non-refundable pre-paid hotel room! 1 month after i booked the room and 1 month before I was staying there my credit card was charged for the room!  I was treated like an idiot by Carmen who answered the phone.  She kept saying that I should have known but I would not have been so upset if I had known the hotel could charge my card any time they wanted!!  Make sure whoever you speak to tells you everything when booking a room!!  Would not recommed this hotel solely based on the way I have been treated!!!
0,Steer clear of this hotel.  Mediocre rooms but very unpleasant service - they do not honor reservation requests and have nothing but excuses. Bar is way overpriced.  There are MANY choices in Charlotte - do not consider this hotel as one.
0,We went on a Friday and it wasn't too busy. We all had a wonderful time until the end. We were in the womens locker room and even though they had a family locker room there were little boys there about 6-7 years old changing in the room too and one walking around with no clothes on. I had my little sister and did not appreciate it at all. When I talked to staff all they asked me was if they had autism? It doesnt chnge anything.Come on there was a family bathroom right there. And they didn't seem too concerned about my complaint. And the bathrooms were nasty. But if you don't use the locker rooms or bathrooms it is good.
0,"I like to think of myself as an appreciater of art.  I've loved the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the Art Institute of Chicago, The National Gallery in London, and, of course, the Smithsonian in DC.  Upon moving to Charlotte, we decided to visit the Museum of Crap + Design (er, Craft + Design) one afternoon (it's free between certain hours on Tuesdays) to check it out.   We quickly breezed our way through it, as what we saw were mostly sticks and twigs stuck into things.  It was not impressive by any means and not \""art\"" in my book.  I'll stick to Charlotte's Mint Museum of Art if I want to see something artsy."
0,"My daughter will be leaving Queens after this spring.  I feel like we were duped.  \n\nThe school is a publicity machine with nothing behind it.  The students have no sense of community, and the neighbors hate them.  My daughter has had terrible things said and shouted at her by the supposedly \""charming\"" upscale people with their \""beautiful\"" homes.  The neighbors hate the school and take it out on students.\n\nThe school does not care about students once they have enrolled.  They nickel and dime them for every little thing.  There is no social life on the campus or near the campus.  \n\nMy daughter says that the morale of the teachers is awful.   Two have talked about what they make and how it is insufficient.\n\nMy daughter has older friends who did well on their SATs and had good grades and cant get into graduate school.  There is no network to help with jobs, except maybe nursing.\n\nDont send your child to Queens."

0,"I totally agree with you that Time Warner Cable has one of the worst customer service I have come across.  Sorry for the comment.  They may be the only service provider in this area that they do not care or the employees have not been paid enough that they do not care about their job.\n\nI signed up as they knocked at my door.  Like someone said, we need internet nowadays.  We need cable TV in order we can get national or world news, more informatory program or some quality programs.  They were fast to install for you.  But when you do not have service, it takes forever to talk to someone on the phone or they hanged you up after waiting forever.\n\nHowever when I wanted to seek their help, they would not answer you without a pin and kept transfer you to so many departments (really that big, I don't know) till your phone call dropped.  That will take you hours on the phone without a solution.\n\nAs I need to move and cancel the account, they will give you a hard time.  Watch out this company."
0,"I was a customer for approx 16 yrs.  Only because they were my only option.  Came home one day to find out they had cut off my service because I had a balance of $28.00.  It was gonna be $150 and 2 wks before I could get it turned back on.  Needless, to say I told them to bite me and welcomed DirecTV which I love. !!!"
0,"Time Warner Cable is awful.  I really recommend looking elsewhere for your cable/internet before choosing them.\nI have had nothing but issues with my cable and internet since I had them, which has been about 3 years.  My internet will be slow for no reason atleast once a week, my cable will freeze and I will have to restart my box...which is annoying when you are trying to watch tv.\n\nAlso, they really have the worst customer service I have ever dealt with. I recieved a bill from them a YEAR AND HALF after the fact for 35 bucks.  The best part is, I do not even have time warner in my name anymore....when I asked why I got this bill so late, they told me that since I moved they no longer had a \""bill to\"" address.\n\nhmm, very odd that no other companies had any issues with sending mail to my new address.  Its also extremely odd that they could not contact me via e-mail or telephone? Would that have been so difficult? I dont think so.\n\nI called them up to discuss his and ask them these questions and the person I spoke to was dumbfounded.  Yea, I would be to.....because it makes NO SENSE TO BILL SOMEONE A YEAR AND A HALF LATER AND THE FIRST TIME THEY SEE THE BILL IS WHEN IT IS SENT TO THEM A YEAR AND A HALF LATER.\n\nDo yourself a favor, take to look into another internet/cable provider.  It is not worth the hassel or the headache."
0,"Well money talks so they talked me into giving them another try.  Well, I ended up telling them I never wanted to hear even their name again.  4wks later and I still had nothing hooked up and they cut the main cable line to my condo property and at&t's line when trying to bury some new lines for me.  They have no idea what they are doing and you get a different story each time you call them.  They better never even step foot near my door again.  Horrible !!!!"
0,"UGH!  Worst service ever!!!  We kept having issues with our wireless where it would go out sporatically so we called up TW and they sent out a service person to take a look.  First of all, they charge for the service visit because they outsource their maintenance.  Second of all, after FIVE visits (most of which were extremely late and tracked dirt into our apartment) the problem was still not rectified.  They tried to charge us for a new modem because they said that would fix the problem, and when it didn't, it took forever for them to pay me back for the modem we weren't using.\n\nJust switched to ATT U-Verse and it's cheaper, better, and they don't call every month to see if I want to add services."
0,"One star reviews do not happen often for me, but I see no other option in this case. The bottom line is there is a total disconnect between their sales department and customer service.\n\nSales called me and gave me a deal that was too good to be true. However, the sucker that I am for a deal, I got it. I questioned the sales rep repeatedly to make sure that what she was offering was very clear and there were no hidden fees. Looking back, they'll tell you whatever is needed to just get you to buy in without any consequence for lying to the customer. \n\nA month later I got my bill, which was supposed to be $75-$80 and it was well over $250 (remember, too good to be true). After I picked my jaw up off the floor, I called them...and stayed on hold for an hour. After talking to customer service and finally putting in a request for a supervisor to review my call, I had to wait for a return call. Never happened. Apparently, customer service and billing have different promos or authorizations than the sales teams. This cycle of calling without a response went on for at least 3 times  and over 3 hours of waiting before I could ever get to someone who could do anything to resolve my billing issue. At the end, I assure you I was much more firm and less willing to be pushed off to the next person.\n\nThe customer service proved to me that they do not care about the customer experience, loyalty, or anything in my behalf. So, I dropped the service. *I showed them.*\n\nShame on you, Time Warner Cable."
0,"This is for Time Warner Cable as a whole:\nFOR SHAME!\n\nThe house next door is a rental. Everytime somebody moves out and has their cable disconnected, our's is disconnected too. I have to call and have it reconnected. They always want somebody to be at the home when a technician comes and I have to argue with the service rep that there is no reason for me to be at home and to do the connection at the street. Still they argue that someone has to be there. I refuse and tell them either send somebody out there or DirectTV is looking pretty promising. Boom! Done. Somebody finally comes out there when I'm not home. This last time the technician actually came back out to ask me about what's going on and he went back up the pole and labled our cables seperately to hopefully avoid an outage when somebody moves out again. I wish I got his name to give him some kudos. \n\nAlways ask for a credit for a day or two's worth whenever you have an outage.\n\nYour pal,\nWalter"
0,"I was offered internet sufficient to stream video for $29.99, and then when called to set up appointment to install service I asked what I would be charged and was told $34.95. I then called customer service to discuss what I would be paying and was told the $34.95. I explained that I had been quoted less, and the agent told me he could not do anything to help me. I think service providers should honor their word. I will use a carrier that is truthful and honest."
0,"Terrible customer service.  I wanted to change my services, after an hour and a half on the phone, the change I wanted was not done and I was disconnected.  Called back and was told wait time would be 30 minutes.  I gave up.  If I could cancel service on line, I would, but that is not an option.  The only way to cancel is to call their number wait forever and pray you dont get cut off.  If you are looking to subscribe look at other alternatives first.  I read somewhere that Charlotte has the highest Time Warner rates in the country.  Avoid this company if you can.  Once they have you they make it hard to escape."
0,"Wish I could give TWC zero stars. They have billed me wrong consistently for 4 months straight, then hit me with fees that don't make any sense. When I call to discuss, I am on hold for an average of 40 minutes. When I finally get someone on the phone, they are rarely helpful. One woman told me her manager would call me back and he never did. \n\nThe worst part is, I'm an accountant and even I can't figure out their billing system. It should be illegal the way they bill people. It doesn't help that they have a monopoly on almost all downtown apartments in the Charlotte area. I have bugged AT&T U-verse about offering in my area, so hopefully I will be able to switch soon. If you are considering moving into an apartment building that only offers TWC, I urge you to reconsider! Possible the most frustrating company I have ever interacted with."
0,"I dislike TWC.  I searched online for drop-off locations and found several; however, none of the phone numbers are in service.  I decided to drive to one of the locations only to find it doesn't exist.  I am so frustrated with trying to return this box.  If you live in the Charlotte NC area, where can I drop this darn box off to?"
0,"I am typing this as I wait on hold AGAIN for the second day in a row, I have now lost 53 minutes of my life on hold with TWC.\n\nTime Warner Cable makes me cuss and weep.  I luckily lived in an area for the past several years which had AT&T U-Verse which is AWESOME.... I never had a second of trouble with any of the services (phone, interwebz and cable for a while - but now just interwebz, with broadcast channels only trom TWC for $18/mo.).  I am moving in a few weeks to a location that does not have AT&T U-Verse, so I am forced back to TWC, NOT HAPPY.\n\nWhen you finally get a human through the voice activated maze followed by commercials for all of their services, they are generally polite and helpful, but the problem is getting a human.  After sitting on hold for approx. 20 minutes yesterday and hearing that you can \""manage appointments\"" either online or via some app 17 times, I downloaded the app and searched for the ability to manage my appointment (move day has changed, so I needed to move the install appointment for internet) and you can't actually manage anything. You can look at it, but all I managed to do was become more annoyed.  I then tried the chat function for help, when I finally connected with a person online, I hung up.  MISTAKE.  You have to call to change appointment times.  BLERGH!  Back on the phone again, voice maze, stupid ads... I finally had to get back to my life after 20 more minutes on hold and gave up for the day.  \n\nSo here I am... again... on hold... we are now at the 12 minute mark to change my appointment time.  In all of my moves, the techs have been terribly pleasant (with one exception that I got my pepper spray out for just in case - he was an odd bird), generally on time (within the window) and if you manage to get a human on the phone for support or assistance, they are always helpful and polite as well.  Since they apparently hire good people, HIRE MORE!"
0,TWC is the worst cable company I've ever dealt with. Each time I've called for Tech Support I was on hold for at least an hour. Their only response is to unplug the box.  I'm on my 2nd DVR box in 2 months & channels go out randomly.  If you can get cable somewhere else do it!
0,"This is my first TWC experience as I relocated from out of state.  It is by far the WORST service provider experience I've ever experienced in my life.  I had to call 3 separate times @ 30 mins each to start an account.  The first 2 times they were cancelled automatically after I called because the \""current tenant\"" in the apartment hadn't put in a turn off request yet.  No one called or emailed me, I called back to confirm and they said, \""oh you should have been called...... TWICE\""  they had to run my credit TWICE since the two calls were over 30 days apart.  The folks on the phone are incredibly rude.\n\nThe # on the self install kit (listed in 30+ places in the manual) was disconnected when you call it.\n\nI called for billing (My first bill was $36 incorrect), I got tech support, they transferred me to billing (which I selected on the auto menu), I got through to Billing, They informed me they were \""in massachussets\"" they'd have to transfer me to Charlotte, which was the # I called on my bill to begin with!\n\nABSOLUTE 100% AVOID AT ALL COSTS.  This is my only YELP review ever.  It has been so infuriating I had to take the time to warn anyone.\n\n(DIRECTV before & after TWC is a god send)."
0,I have tried repeatedly to get this company to refund an incorrect amount charged to my mother who died.  There is no email and I have spent hours on the phone.  USE any other service if you can.
0,"Time Warner Cable is an incompetent company that runs a monopoly on internet services in certain neighborhoods.  They will enroll you in bill pay, then charge you late fees when their service fails to draw funds.  Not failure to draw funds from a lack of cash in the account.  No, this is a failure to draw funds because their billing department is complete and utter garbage.  Their services are sub par and they over charge for this shit service because as previously stated they run the only line available for entire neighborhoods and small towns through out the Charlotte area."
0,"I do not like this company! For years I have been forced to work with them for Internet and cable and have been consistently dissatisfied with the customer service. Inconsistent billing, poor customer service, and lies sum up this service. Can't wait for more service providers."
0,"My wife and I have always liked the cable repair personnel but the customer service has always been the biggest joke- wrong departments , dropped calls, crazy appointment problems. I'm a small businessman who has sadly come to the conclusion that large corporations that dominate a market have no incentives to provide good service,customer communication, and reasonable prices. Time Warner Cable has done a horrible job of operating in this area although I fear that   the competitors are any better. A tollfree guy told me about \""claiming\"" to have an appointment I scheduled and wanted to know who I wanted to talk to- I said whoever can help me fix my problem- he then asked what department that was and in the transfer the line went dead. Its a sorry corporation that doesn't care about customer dissatisfaction, and wasted time spent by the consumer."
0,"This is for Time Warner as a company, not a specific location, I have only worked with them online and over the phone.  I also wish that I could provide them with ZERO STARS.  This company is the worst to deal with.  It started off with my order being processed twice due to an issue with their website.  So I chatted with an analyst to have it resolved.  She then had to call me because she said my credit card was being rejected.  After about 45 minutes she realized she was entering it incorrectly.  Then the day they should have been coming out to install I found out that they changed my street address in their computer when moving from the ordering system to the installation ordering system.  Therefore they installer never made it to my apartment.  When I noticed the change on the emails I received I called immediately (about 15 minutes after my scheduled install window).  The woman on the phone told me that she corrected it and contacted the driver who confirmed the new address and would still be coming.  After waiting another 2 hours with no contact I called back and the new person told me that it isn't possible to just update an address and that she had to put in a whole new order.  Oh and my specific apartment unit was not in there system so they would have to send someone out to survey before the installation so I couldn't set up another installation for almost 2 weeks.  (Mind you they had every other apartment in my building and when I originally placed the order they had no problem finding my address and signing me up)  The analyst also submitted an escalation about my issue so I could speak with a supervisor (after waiting for one for about a half an hour on the phone) within 24 hours.  Waited the whole day and no call back.  So I chatted online again and was told the escalation process takes 2-3 days not 24 hours.  I then said I just wanted to cancel any pending orders that I had in the system, to which I was told I had to call in to do.  Ok so I try to call after being hung up on by their system twice, hung up on once by a person, transferred and being on hold and trying to get through for almost a hour I finally get through to someone (nearly in tears to just end the process at this point) she asks if there is anything she can do to keep my business, I go through everything I have been through and she says \""I have gone ahead and cancelled your order\"" nothing else.  So of course I am not surprised when I look at my credit card bill and they have charged me.  So here I go again...try chatting online and they tell me they can send a check, I say I want my credit card charged back, and they tell me I have to call a local office.  But I placed the order online, then I am on hold again.  Their response \""I can submit an escalation and you will hear back from someone in 2-3 days\"".  I'm done I throw in the towel trying to deal with them.  I submitted a dispute through my credit card company and hope they can get through to them.  I am now using Clearwire.  Took me 2 minutes to place the order online, it was overnighted to me, 2 minutes to plug in and log on.  Why didn't I go with them first??  I WILL NEVER USE TIMEWARNER CABLE.  I would go without internet before I use them."
0,"Well, I never thought I would be writing a 1-star review for anything, anywhere, at any time in the present century. However, I'm MORE than happy to give the lowest rating for this location/company/provider that is humanly possible due to the sheer lack of......anything and everything. \n\nHere's my story: Simplicity until the need to cancel service came around. Shouldn't be too hard of a task, yeah? WRONG. \n\nI call, speak with the first depressing voice on the other end of the phone, and then I'm transferred to some other \""department.\"" (5 minutes on hold)\n\n \""Hello, this is aosidfh;qwoeifasdf;qlweirfg;aoid. How can I help you today?\"" I repeat my need to cancel service.\n\n *Computer clicking in the distance* accompanied by a LONG pause. (4 minutes of this).\n\n\""Ok, sir. I'll transfer you to a;sldkfjq;owifa in the uralfj*($(&%*$(#(# department.\"" \nMe: \""But all I need to do is cancel my service and give you a forwarding address for my last bill.\"" (5 minutes on hold)..................still transferred.\n\n\""Hello, sir. This is !@#$%QWEF. How can I help you today?\""\n\nARE YOU KIDDING ME. ALL I NEED TO DO IS CANCEL MY SERVICE.\n\n3rd person, on the phone for another 12 minutes....I've lost my mind at this point. For shorthand math, that's 25 minutes on the phone. At this point in time, I'm just praying I don't get disconnected. She FINALLY comes back and asks for my forwarding address, of which I have to repeat no less than 5 times to her. \n\nMe: \""Ok. Just to clarify -- My service is cancelled, correct?\""\nLess-than-able TWC Employee: \""Yes.\""\nMe: \""You have my forwarding address for my last bill, correct?\""\nLess-than-able TWC Employee: \""Yes. Is there anything else I can help you with today?\""\n\n......\""help?\"" I was almost insulted that she used that as a descriptor. \""Help\"" isn't something that TWC provides. They provide song and dance and circumvention as opposed to service. \n\nThe story doesn't end there. I had to go to this location on Morehead to return the modem we rented. BAD IDEA. It's the saddest place on earth. They opened the doors at 8am and the one woman behind the counter had a small line of \""eager\"" customers. She barely paid any mind to anyone and then said, with little to no interest, \""Can I help who's next?\"" Then, randomly, she just left and started bringing boxes in to the room one by one.....WHY? Nobody knows. \n\nI got to the counter, returned the modem as swiftly as possible to the rather sad employees, and hastily left the non-existent customer service clubhouse TWC runs there. It was unreal. The whole experience, from start to finish, was the most agonizing exchange I've ever had to go through. Completely malarkey.  \n\nMoral of the story: If you want to do \""business\"" with TWC, beware."
0,"After years of outages, poor quality video, service disruptions, and crappy customer service, I finally decided to switch to AT&T.\n\nLet me tell you, I've never had a WORSE experience with ANY company than TWC as I tried to get my service disconnected. I called in 2 full weeks ahead of my requested disconnection date, just to make sure everything would go smoothly. After holding for an hour, I finally talked to a lady who scheduled the disconnect, gave me a confirmation number, and everything. We went to return the equipment at the local TWC office; waited in line over an hour to turn in the equipment. \n\n2 weeks later, I check the internet - they still don't show my service disconnected. I get on line with a chat agent at TWC, and he says I'll have to call and they have no record of me disconnecting. I got very upset at the thought of calling and holding for another hour to talk to someone so I really let him have it. He then agreed to disconnect me as of 9/6, like it was some sort of favor to me. Never mind the fact that I even had the cancellation number from the phone call. \n\nSo today I look online again, and they show that I owe them $25. Actually, they owe ME $25 for the week of service I paid for and hadn't used. So, I get online again, and guess what? the chat agent that I talked to 2 weeks ago didn't set my disconnect for the original date. Instead he did it 2 weeks after! \n\nSo I got online with another chat agent today who once again apologized and is \""escalating my case\"". I've now spent over 6 hours trying to help the incompetent CSR's at TWC to actually do this correctly. Meanwhile, we've had AT&T now for over a month. Guess what? Not a SINGLE outage, not a single disruption. And customer service is prompt and helpful. \n\nI will never, ever sign up for TWC again. I don't care if I have to go without TV someday vs. paying TWC another cent. They should be a Harvard case study on how to run your business in such an incompetent, offensive way that you actually lose customers for life. I guess if they don't do it right this time, I will just pay the $25 (so they don't do something to mess up my credit) and then file a complaint with the State utilities commission. \n\nAvoid TWC. Not worth the money you will pay, and certainly not worth the pain you will experience if you ever need to contact them for anything. Worst customer service of any business I've ever dealt with."
0,"After Time Warner Cable raised my internet rates again with no improved service, I switched to EarthLink. While earthlink gave me the introductory rate, TWC who services the account, was unable or unwilling to honor it. I think I have spoken by now to 21 representatives, spend a good 5 hours on the phone, lost Internet three times because TWC turned it off; and still got overcharged by $40. They say they have it fixed now. I am not holding my breath here."
0,"I wish there were zero stars. I had TWC for several years and they were always a pain. Internet service was shoddy, they throttle speed,  they bully you into cable subscriptions to keep themselves relevant, and they just gave us a $125 unreturned equipment fee for equipment that I did in fact return. They have odd hours,  and if you move you have to physically bring the box to their office. And guess what?  No after hours drop box,  so your only option is to take time out of your work day. AT&T is much better. Avoid TWC like the plague. They'll never stop nickel and diming you."
0,"It is the first time I gave 1-rated review, while I normally gave 4-5 stars regardless of service quality. The worst service came from TWC. Took me over an hour on the call but nothing had been done. All they did is to transfer the phone call to another representative after telling me \""I can't do this, I can't do that\"". Worst service ever!"
0,"The drop off process for returning your cable box is ridiculous. It's as tedious as waiting at the DMV. I don't understand why Time Warner can't pick up the box, since it's required for someone to come to the house to install it. \n\nOr at least have a drop-off box! Or here's another idea- hire more than one employee in a waiting room of 50 people.\n\nStep it up Time Warner!!!"
0,"Prepare for a LONG wait, poor customer service and God forbid you have to use the restroom while you wait 30+ minutes! Unfortunately there is nothing good I can say about TW Cable. Besides the extremely poor customer service when visiting their office, the equipment they offer is outdated, to reach someone in customer service via a phone call, you are definitely going to be dealing with a mess.\n\nThe best DVR they can offer customers is a model that can only record 2 shows at a time compared to other companies that now have models that can record up to 5 shows at a time. The only reason I am with them is because they are the only provider for my home at the moment and satellite is not an option."
0,"Worse customer service ever.\nWhen I got up yesterday,  I had no information guide and could not control the volume. After being on the phone with them for SEVERAL hours, and doing everything they told me, I now have no picture, sound or anything. Before I talked to them, I could change channels and had a picture. They say the problem is with the TV, and they will send someone tomorrow, which would have been today.  They SURPRISE, did not show up, I called, the automated line asked was I calling about the account at my number, I said yes, they asked was I calling about my appointment at 3 (I called at 4), I said yes, they transferred me to someone who told me I did not have an appointment, even though the recording had just said I had, I told them I expected a credit, since I have NO service, the TV's now say no signal, before calling yesterday, I had a picture and could change channels.  I pay a lot for this \""SERVICE\"" , say they are coming tomorrow, I told them if that woman had broken my TV's with all she had me do that they WOULD be replacing them, if they cannot get my TV's up and running tomorrow."
0,"If you want crappy customer service, avoidance at all costs to FIX a problem that has been questioned for months (we have service cut outs on a daily basis-fyi we're gamers in this household we need good internet that doesn't cut out every day), and high prices...\nThen choose TWC.\n\nTWC reps do NOT READ your reports (we had a report drawn up so we could go to a senior tech). The girl who answered after we waited for 10+ minutes on hold wanted to go over the WHOLE issue with us again when it was already written out in the report had she bothered to read it.\n\nIf you want better internet, go elsewhere but let me know because I'll come with you!!\nStep it UP!!"

0,"The worst place on earth. Lines are ridiculous no matter what time you arrive, customer service is deplorable and there are never enough parking spaces. This place rivals the dmv and social security office, Time Warner is a monopoly in Charlotte so it doesn't have to worry with how it treats it's customers. We normally don't have cable, but we're adding it back for football season. I am spending my day off waiting in this absurd line for a cable box so that my husband can watch the Panthers. If only we could get ESPN on our Apple TV... I can't wait until we can just stream everything"

I waited and waited and waited and waited....before I actually was able to talk to someone who could assist me with ONE of my problems.\n\nBills: I recieved a $400+ bill before (and I only have one tv in my small studio apartment) needless to say my soul left my body for 10 seconds when I saw the bill...\nI'm a struggling law student, you best believe I called up customer service and \""acted a damn fool.\"" After praying to God for cussing the representatives and having my bill reduced all was well....and then....\n\nCrisis number 2 happened.

Then second course I had the Tomato with goat cheese and peas I had one bite and did not go back for another. The plate was filled with tomato liquid and the goat cheese was running right in it  YUCK is all I have to say!! Then finally our last course MY favorite is Rack of Lamb so of course I'm now anticipating my Lamb I had asked for it to be cooked Rare/Medium Rare just in case they were to over cook it. WELL sure enough it came out Medium Well...Now i would have sent it back but my friend had ordered his steak Medium Well and got his Rare so i didnt want to be that table that sent everything back....\n\nOnly good thing about this place was my company. it is outdated they may want to rethink they're concept AGAIN and possibly add a few woman servers in there to bring some life to this place!! Finally this place was stale like the bread!!"
0,...and they're closed.  Couldn't have happened to a more deserving group of people.  Found out the chef that told me he was the owner was NOT the owner.  Found out he left less than a month after this incident.  The restaurant closed less than four months after that.  Good riddance!
0,"I waited a few months to review because my experience was so bad, I am hoping things have changed by now. I booked my appointment with a third level 'color specialist' to darken my hair a bit, light brown to a solid auburn. After ratting my hair in a knot and then trying to brush it out, more like ripping, and telling me \""pain is beauty\"" numerous times, my hair turned out 2 different shades. The top half being orange and the bottom being orange red. When asked what I thought, I pointed out the two different shades and how orange my hair was. I was told he would put something else on it to even it out. Second time around, still really brassy and two shades. Third time, I said just to go dark brown because we weren't getting it right and I had been there for 3 hours already. I get my hair done every 8 to 12 weeks and have never had an experience like this. The hairdresser was so focused on his personal issues, which I heard about, that I don't think he was paying attention to what he was doing. Safe to say, I was really upset and disappointed when I left. The rest of the staff seemed really nice and the place was pretty and clean, maybe I just caught the hairdresser on a bad day??"
0,"Bar Charlotte is a place where golddiggers go to listen to pop rap and find sugar daddies.  There is a huge dancefloor in the center of the bar with sweaty eighteen year olds bumping and grinding on one another, and half naked girls dancing on bars and tabletops.  I really would not recommend this joint to anyone who has any real taste in music and/or respect for themselves.  The drinks are overpriced, and the girls are underage.  Save your time."
0,"In the same (horrible) vein as the next door Have A Nice Day, this place is the definition of 'meat market'.\n\nA dark, dimly lit, sweaty joint where oversexed teenagers and college-age kids go to bump and grind to obnoxious rap and house music.\n\nFor some reason this place is often crowded, and the bathrooms are an exercise in survival, as you either get accosted by drunk or drugged-out people while in line or by the guy in the monkey-suit trying to get you to buy some smell-good or tip him as you're leaving.\n\nHorrible way to spend an evening if you like good music, care to be around people who respect themselves, and if you care to have a meaningful conversation with anyone."
0,"If you're a black male don't go to Bar Charlotte, they are racist. I was denied entry on 12/21/12. The door man, said I was denied entry because of my boots.On the website it says that the dress code was no construction boots, which I clearly had on Aldo boots. I am a successful, preppy looking black guy. This has never happened to me before at any other club downtown.I cant believe people are still bigots and its about be 2013 :CC"
0,I was banned for life from this bar in the Spring of 2006.
0,"My instinct always told me that I should skip this place. Should have listened. It was just gross; literally and figuratively. I was afraid to see what I was stepping on out on the dance floor. Music was good, drinks were surprisingly decent. But oh, the other club patrons...\nI appreciate a little adult fun time dancing as much as the next gal, but it was just sleazy."
0,"This was my first time coming to this restaurant and I came because a lot people and media were talking about it. I took my Mom on Sunday for her birthday. \n\nThe only thing good about our meal was the water, orange juice and corn bread snack. Actually, the OJ was room temperature, so it was 'borderline good'.\n\nI ordered smoked pork chops, home fries and green beans. My Mom order salmon cakes, collard greens and mac-cheese. The pork chops had a good smoke flavor, but they were too salty and paper thin. The fries were over-cooked and soft. The green beans were greasy and tasted sweet. Sometimes, people will add a little sugar to green beans if they accidentally add too much salt; I believe that was the case.\n\nMy Mom's salmon cakes were dry, the collard greens were flavorless and under cooked (probably just stir-fried) and the mac-cheese was dry.\n\nNot only was the food bad, but it wasn't even hot and my green beans had a little solid grease on them (eeewwwww!).\n\nI won't go back because the meal was expensive (w/tip), the parking was terrible and the food was no good.\n\nIt was a total disappointment for me. I was embarrassed for recommending this restaurant."
0,"I am so sorry to rate Mert's so poorly but after the treatment received today I must admit to extreme disappointment in one of my previously favorite Charlotte establishments.  After being invited repeatedly via automated email marketing, I decided to go with a group of friends to celebrate my birthday with lunch at Mert's.  After the most interesting discussion (!) with manager (?) I discovered that I did not have the necessary \""proof\"" to rate the birthday \""deal\"" in spite of having a valid NC driver license clearly showing my date of birth.  In today's economy, I was stunned that any food establishment would take such a tack with a good paying customer!  No worries on seeing my dollars at Mert's ever again.  To many restaurants want my patronage.\n-cheers"
0,"Would never go back!  I was in a party of 3 that was seated at a table for 4, and was then asked if we could move to accommodate another group.  Okay, not a big deal.  However, it all went down hill from there.  Our waitress was nice and polite, but we waited for close to an hour and still nothing showed up at our table.  The people that were sitting at our original table had been served and had already left.  We asked our waitress a number of times why we weren't getting our food, and she kept apologizing and saying \""it's on it's way.\""  But it never came.  It wasn't like we ordered anything unusual, it was eggs, sausage and toast.  The whole thing was weird because others were getting served, and their food was arriving at their table.  Finally, we just said thanks, but no thanks and left."
0,To sum up my recent trip to Mert's...pretty delicious food yet poor customer service. The only fast service was for the drinks and cornbread. Our waiter was very inconsistent and neglecting us. There were at least four tables with more than three customers which received their entrees before my girlfriend and I did. It will be a very long time before I go to Merts again.
0,"In my opinion EPIC FAIL ...... I'm from Charlotte and my first time going there was last week and boy was i not impressed. I guess when soul food come to my mind i think of greatness because I'm from the south, it could be a lot better."
0,"I rarely give bad reviews, but this was a pretty horrible food experience. My cousin was in town today from Seattle and requested \""good soul food.\"" I've heard good things about Mert's, but have not had an opportunity to try. I figured it would be a good opportunity to show my cousin some good souther food. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. The fried chicken was pretty bland. It seemed like it was pre-made and left out for too long. The collard greens were insanely salty. Instant high blood pressure for sale! :( I ordered the salmon cakes which were really hard. I have to say that the corn bread was absolutely amazing, which makes no sense that the rest of the food was so unappetizing."
0,"The service here sucks. We went there and they got us the main meal before the appetizer and bread.  When I requested to have my appetizer first, the waitress replied that they are expecting lots of people from the convention and they are trying to get us out as fast as possible. I immediately left. \n\nNever going to go back again."
0,Horrible!!
0,"My husband & I went here based on the reviews from here. We were in Charlotte for our anniversary and I was eager to try the local cuisine. I like trying small businesses and supporting them. With that said...Mert's was disappointing and overpriced. The fried chicken was bland, you should not have to put salt on fried chicken. The Mac n cheese and pound cake was ok at best. The fish had bones in it and one got caught in the back of hubby's throat. The greens and yams were ok. The WORST was the red beans; tasted like they were cooked in a caldron of hell. I got peach cobbler and could not eat it because it was disgusting!!! Horrible!!! If I go to a place especially a mom and pop and spend almost $40 for 2 dinners and 2 desserts it should be excellent. I have gone to mom pop shacks spend under $20 and got excellent food like grandma makes. I would not recommend this place and would never go back. I can't believe people like this food. It's too bad I have to leave this review because I love supporting small businesses and especially black operated small businesses. Yuck!"
0,"I had such high hopes for this place but it fell short in many ways. I had their fried green tomatoes and for $6, I got 4 slices of skinny green tomatoes, deep fried and over battered.  Tried their fried chicken, it wsa crispy but why is the portion so small. The table cloth is grimy and sticky..\n\nTry a Waffle house and I think you'll have a better dining experience."
0,"I am a new resident to the City of Charlotte. In search of some where to have dinner in the uptown area, to celebrate my friends Birthday, we came across this quant  place. bypassing 5star gourmet restaurants we opted to have  a quite dinner with some soul food. The restaurant was interestingly decorated  and the menu was appetizing.  The service on the other hand was not.  I had never tried shrimp and grits before  so I being a special occasion I decided to try something new. when the dish came to the table the presentation was nice however the taste was not satisfactory. it was overloaded with onion and It was not enjoyable to me. So I then asked the waitress if something could be done because I didn't like  the dish. She told me \""I have to get the manager, because I can't change once the food is on the table.\""  I told her that was fine. The manager never came to offer any apologies nor explain what the solution could be. the waitress comes back after like 15mn and says \""She says pick something of the menu and we'll trade it out.\"" I then chose the chicken dinner. The waitress nor the food did not come back for almost another 20mn. she then comes to the table not to refill drinks or to apologize for the wait. but to offer to bag up the meal and bring the check. at this point I was embarrassed for bringing my friend to this place and irritated because I was hungry and very annoyed with the service I told her yes please bring the check. she brings a check not only with the meal I changed for but also the initial meal that I did not eat. I was confused asked to speak tho the manager by another waitress. that waitress says sure she's the lady over there in the red shirt.  and walks the other way.  So I then call the manager over to clarify that this was a mistake. she says \""If the owner was here he would not be playing with y'all. He would make you pay for both. I on the other hand will take it off.\"" I was floored at the way she spoke to me and the fact that the owner would make a patron pay for something they didn't like. I felt stereo typed and embarrassed that it was my people to treat us this way. So needless to say we will not be returning back to this establishment ever! I hope this is not hospitality in Charlotte."
0,"What a disappointment!  My first day in Charlotte and I had checked Yelp reviews to plan my meals.  The only good thing I can say is service was friendly and the cornbread was good.  \nHowever, that wasn't enough to even warrant a second star because the rest of my food was so unpleasant.  I started with the soul rolls, but thought the mixture of flavors and textures did not harmonize well.  It seemed to be a fried app just for the sake of being fried.  But without the pleasing crunch I expected.\nBut the real let down was my shrimp and grits.  What they served me was a bowl of lumpy grits (one particular lump was too big for my spoon to handle) swimming in a truly awful brown mess.  The color made me think the sauce might be rich, but it was the opposite.  I could probably recreate the flavor with water, thickener and food color - that is just how tasteless it was.  The shrimp had a strange texture that made me think it came from a can.  Then someone had chopped raw green onion and stirred it in.  That was it.  No seasoning.  No flavor."
0,"Although I have been using yelp for many years, this is my first review. My husband and I went to Mert's on Sunday morning around 1015. It was not full so we were seated immediately, right next to the server station. We watched server after server, at least 5 of them pass our table to put orders in the computer, server after server chat with each other, not one addressed our table. Not one said I will be your server I will be with you shortly. Not one said would you like some water. Not one said let me find who your server is. Not one. This went one for 15 minutes before we decided to get up and leave!  The service is terrible!!!"
0,"I spoke with Veronica the general manager. She apologized profusely for the mix up and assured me that she spoke with the staff. Ultimately, there was confusion about who was responsible for our table. She indicated that a long wait to be acknowledged is not common practice.\n\nShe invited me back to the restaurant. Based in her response, I will give them another try and hopefully add more stars. I was so disappointed because I was hungry and really wanted to try the seafood omelette."
0,"The worst customer service by server and manager. We've been coming here for years. Tonight's experience is one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had. Supposedly there was a computer error with our food. Fine, I understand it happens sometimes. However while waiting two hours, we repeatedly asked our server about our dinner. We got the same response every time. \""It'll be right up.\"" He did not\nconsider actually checking on the food. All the tables around us came, ate and left. Meanwhile, our server could not even remember to bring water to the table without being asked multiple times. \n\nAfter I stopped asking nicely about our food, the server finally went to inquire. The manager offered to comp two beers for waiting two hours if we wanted to just  leave. How generous. Otherwise she offered to discount our meals and offered us what we thought was another round of beers. She did not even follow through on that promise. We were given one free beer each. Pathetic. Over 80% of the restaurant was filled with people from our convention. People who make it a point to dine here every time we come. \n\nThe server never apologized. Nor did he bother to even clear our plates.\n\nThere are plenty of other places to spend your money where it will be appreciated."
0,WAIST OF TIME!!! My husband and I were in town for our 3 year anniversary and came to Merts after a great recommendation. We went to yelp and read the over all great reviews and were excited about trying this place. We waited about 20 min which was a good sign. The hostess wasn't too friendly but she was super busy so I could understand. Our waitress was an older lady who took our drink orders almost right away. Here is where it went down hill....she took her sweet time coming back to take our order( I know she saw me looking at her like WTH?) once our order was taken those were the very last words she spoke to us. We waited an HOUR with not so much as an I'm sorry this is taking too long or can I get you anything else? Finally my husband overheard a cook in the back yell that our order had not even been processed yet and was 4th in line!!! We threw a 5 on the table for that nasty too sweet diabetes lemonade they gave me and left! WILL NOT RETURN. OH....I'm not sure what corn bread everybody else on this reviews was eating but ours was WACK! Barley warm and not sweet at all. This place has EXTREMELY POOR customer service. We left and went to Emeralds restaurant where the service was SECOND TO NONE!
0,Let me start off by saying that my experience was horrible and I would not recommend this place to anyone.  My wife and I came to Charlotte celebrating our anniversary and decided to try Mert's per recommendation of her supervisor and because of the high praise the restaurant received online.  We were seated in a reasonable time but it was all down hill from there. We were seated at 7:15pm and were given some bland cornbread.  At 8:15pm we were still waiting for our order to be prepared (cooked)...not brought to us...PREPARED! Now mind you no one even a word of apology or an update on the status of our food during the wait. Finally I had enough and walked out. Our waitress and management still did not offer an apology despite seeing us leave the restaurant visibly upset. We left and walked to E2 (emeralds restaurant) and received the best meal and customer service I've ever experienced. I'd recommend all the other restaurants in downtown Charlotte before Mert's. :-/
0,"HORRIBLE customer service! (Not the waitress). The food was warm, had little flavor, and a simple menu item that read differently from what was expected was not offered to be negotiated. From where I'm from, when something reads \""smoked turkey\"" you are expecting just that, not smoked turkey sausage (round slices of a turkey sausage). Even when given the pass of a misunderstanding, the manager (owerners daughter as she so often identify herself) was more interested in making HER point than making sure out of state customers who went out of their way to visit the establishment....and checked-in on Facebook have an enjoyable experience. She was sarcastic & unprofessional. Sorry my family had THAT experience."
0,"Horrible service!!! Server forgot to put our order in. Came back 30 minutes later with lame lie. Another 20 minutes later still no food, not even apps. Hostess also provided 2 new lame lies. We left and will never go back. Dishonest staff ruined it for me. Honesty would  have gone over better. Went to Tupelo Honey Cafe instead. Awesome service and FOOD!!"
0,The worst restaurant ever! It doesn't matter if the food tastes good or not.. The service is the worst! Lazy and slow as ever!
0,"After participating in the Charlotte heart walk, my friends and I went to Mert's for brunch. We knew the service probably wouldn't be that great but expected the food to make up for that. Big fail on that expectation. The collard greens were dry with no flavor and when someone on my party asked if she could exchange them for something else the waitress caught an attitude. Whenever we would ask for something it was almost like a mother may I situation. We didn't know if her reaction would be positive or negative. The manager seemed to not care about our situation and just left everything up to the waitress. After paying my bill I waited for my change that never came. I ended up asking for the manager to find out where the waitress went with my money. After the manager asked the waitress the waitress states she already gave me my change  after reminding her that she didn't give me anything she states oh then I have your money right here! It was in her pocket. Not sure how she could have forgotten that she owed me more than $10!! Especially since the tip was already included in the bill! Never going back and I will never recommend this place to anyone. Even if I do have a living social coupon!!"
0,This was my second and most likely last time attending this restaurant.  Reason for this statement is our waitress topped off my glass of water with water from a glass not a pitcher. Who fills a patrons glass like that?
0,"Took my boyfriend for first time.  Waitress kept going outside smoking and smelled like ashtray upon returning to table.  Cornbread good.  Chicken good.  BBQ was disgusting and swimming in grease.  Potato salad was also old tasting and could not eat.  I was embarrassed that I had bragged to my bf about how good things were and then had such a terrible experience.   And it was over $30 for lunch.  Not worth the drive, parking, or time."
0,"Yuck!  I was on my way to Johnny Burritos when I saw their sign of \""specials\"".  I stopped in and ordered the cream of potato soup and a grilled cheese sandwich.  Both were awful.  The soup had the consistency of milk, and not much flavor.  It's no where close to \""cream of\"" anything.   The cheese on the sandwich was so thin that I pried it open just to ensure myself that they hadn't only given me 2 pieces of plain bread.  I like to support small mom and pop businesses, so I really wanted to like this place.  Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing, but it was so off-putting that I don't plan to ever return.  Next time, I'll keep walking to Johnny Burritos."
0,"Best thing about eating lunch here is the patio seating. Special soft shell crab over mixed green salad was disapponting at best. Soft shell crab was over-battered and lacked crab flavor. Salad was dull and lime vingrette seemed to be missing the lime. Chopped red onion totally overpowered. On prior visits, sweet potatoe fries are decent."
0,"We had a disappointing experience with customer service regarding a group reservation. In fact, they have yet to call back to confirm or cancel. If they can't get a reservation right, what else would have gone wrong?"
0,Getting seated wasn't difficult but after that the experience fell apart. We ordered  cocktails and water. The cocktails came in a timely manner but we only received one water. My husband ordered the shrimp and grits and I ordered the grilled scallops with butternut squash. The temperature of both dishes was cool. Almost room temperature. My husbands shrimp and grits were colder than my squash. The service was not professional. Being rushed to get the credit card out after receiving the bill.
0,"If I could give Mimosa Grill \""0\"" stars, I would.  I made a reservation with Mimosa for my family's Thanksgiving meal in 2012.  I called a month in advance and inquired about the menu.  I was explained all the menu choices that would be available and with Mimosa Grill's reputation, decided to go forward with it.  When we arrived on Thanksgiving Day, the restaurant did not have a menu - it was a buffet.  Never was this mentioned during our 15 minute phone call when I made the reservation.  A lot of people do not like buffets - so this should be made clear!  Secondly, the chef had sizzling salmon on the buffet.  This caused the restaurant to REEK of salmon and therefore every bite of food I took tasted like salmon (which I don't particularly like).  The rest of the food was overly heavy and greasy.  But, hey, at least I didn't gain weight over the holiday.  \n\nI believe when a restaurant serves a holiday meal, there is a special trust they must have with their customers.  We choose to trust the restaurant with our most treasured memories. Also, holidays are so booked, we can't leave and go to another restaurant!  Mimosa Grill blew it (although I am pretty sure we will look back at this and laugh).  We did call Zink's (where we ate last year and owned by the same company) to see if they could fit us in.  Unfortunately, Zink's had also chosen to go with a buffet this year (unlike last year)  and didn't have any tables available.  What a shame - I will definitely be more discriminating next holiday, and my sister is even entertaining the idea of cooking."
0,I looked at the reviews and thought this would be a great place for bunch.  Wrong! I don't know how their regular menu food is but their brunch was horrible with a capital H.  $21 a person was way too much for disgusting food.
0,"I went here for Sunday brunch trusting all the good yelp reviews.  However, I was extremely disappointed.  All the food was cold and clearly had sat around for a long time.  The servers were not friendly.  I politely asked that they bring out some hotter food and I was told \""we are working on it\"" and the employee turned away.  Some \""hotter\"" food came out 20 minutes later but most everything was still cold.  I called back later in the day because for $40 I expected better.  The manager disregarded my feedback, did not follow up, and clearly did not care.  My advice? Stay away unless you have extra money for cold food and bad service."
0,"I have gone to this club in the past and have enjoyed the experience.   I recently decided to revisit this club and had a bad experience .  I saw a dancer that caught my eye. I offered her a drink and a dance. After her canoodling me  I gave in and said i'll take  one ( 30 dollar)  dance.\n\nAfter some pleasant conversation over the drink( I treated her to),  the dance began .  After four minutes the song was over and I reached in my pocket to give her the 30 + 5 dollars for a tip, when she explained I actually owed her 60 dollars  because it was 2 songs.  By my count it was one dance. Apparently she decided to count the 5 minutes of  time we spent talking over the drinks i bought her as part of the dance as well.   I thought she was kidding and gave her the $ 35. This  beautiful little angel suddenly became a crazy little devil. She called her manager and made me out to be some kind of lunatic lowlife cheapskate.   I politely explained the situation to the  manager but he insisted i pay up which i promptly did .  After wards i made a quick exit.   \n\nThere was no mistaken that I was being blatantly scammed here.  I was in the club for less then 10 minutes and hadn't even finished my first beer, and was not drunk in the least.   Unless you don't mind being scammed by a dancer, and paying 60 dollars for a 4 minute dance I would  steer clear from this establishment .  A night I was hoping to relax over a beer and a beautiful dancer cost me 80 dollars for less then 10 minutes of harassment and aggravation.  It appears to be a pretty good club and i couldn't say if they regularly scam the patrons,  but  they sure as hell scammed me.  On principle I'll avoid this place  and I'll tell my friends to go elsewhere as well. The are  a ton of clubs in the area with gorgeous girls  that even have signs on the table that you will never pay for a dancer's time or for  her simply talking to you.\n\nYou've  been warned .\n\nJay"
0,"First and last to this club. Very pricy,poor service and no contact dance. ... Other clubs in charlotte are better ... Very disappointed ....."
0,Worst strip club I've ever been to. Do NOT even think you could use coupons or think the manager will honor anything. Received a complementary free pass and was denied by the manager even though there was no restrictions. Worst service ever
0,Awful!!!! If i could give it no stars I would!!!! Awful!!!! Way way way over priced for bad/ok pizza... over $12.00 for 3 slices who do they think they are...? There food is Ok at best! I live and work uptown I will never go back and will warn friends to stay away!!!! AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!
0,"Unfortunately this could be one of the most disappointing lunch experiences I have had in Uptown.  Being Catholic, and Lent, I was thinking about a slice of cheese pizza, no meat, but didn't want an entire pie. So, after hearing Fuel sold pizza by the slice I called and confirmed, as well as found out they serve side salads.  I headed over around 11:30 to miss any lunch crowd, with having to get back to the office.  I decided to go with the spinach and tomato slice, side salad and 2 garlic knots. First, let me say they put the slice of pizza straight in a brown bag, not horizontal.  So, needless to say when I got back to the office the toppings had literally slid off, the slice was soggy and the bag was covered in grease, ugh! As for the salad, the onions were brown, and I mean bad brown, plus the lettuce was brown and wilted as well.  So, I slid all the toppings off the pizza, ate the dough and ate the garlic knots, after having tried to pick through the lettuce and onions for something fresh, NO.\nI should have known this would have been a bad experience when the guy at the counter was rude and things moved very slowly with only three people in the restaurant.  I absolutely will not be back anytime soon."
0,Aaaaaa-hole employees give the worst service you'll ever have. Unless you're blackout go elsewhere. They wouldn't give me a water for a dollar. $1.08. Ate the pizza dry as shit. Never again. Pizza was good though.
0,"Second delivery second problem.  My girlfriend ordered wings and I took the order.....no wings.  \nWhen we called, she was informed that we did get the wings.  Evidently, they are invisible wings!!!\nPizza was mediocre BTW"
0,"Ordered at ORDER HERE sign. She sends me to the cashier. Cashier asks me to repeat my order to him. I give him an \""are you serious\"" look. What a bunch of idiots."
0,We went there for restaurant week. The place is very cozy. Drinks are at least $8 a pop. The hostess was really accommodating and friendly. Unfortunately the food was far from impressive. They brought bread and bean which is yummy but there were not enough for eight of us. I'm not sure why you would bring 5 slices of bread on a table of 8 (we must look like those Atkins diet people). The crab/salmon patty was overcook. The risotto was good. The dinner (some kind of fish) was salty. To make matter worse... I found a long blond hair in my fish. The waiter comp my meal out. The manager never come out and talk to us (I think he's too busy tasting the wines). In conclusion... yea... we're not coming back.
0,"BEWARE! Housekeepers are THIEFS!\n\nI stayed at Double Tree in Charlotte, NC for 6 hours, while I was sleeping a house keeper entered my room and stole $400 out of my wallet. \n\nI confronted the manager, they checked to see the history log of entries to my room and the manager confirmed a house keeper did enter my room 20 minutes before I woke up and complained. Then told me that he does not think she took the money because she is a long time employee and that was it.... Why did she enter my room while I was sleeping at 12:43 noon time? There was not a single knock or a phone call. She claimed there was noise complaint between 3 rooms. Wouldn't the lobby call or knock on my door? The manager did nothing to help, and I ended up leaving the hotel to go to the airport. I am shocked that this would happen at a Double Tree and the manager did not offer ANY HELP! I will not stay at Double Tree ever again for the lack of help from the management. Manager did not even offer to comp my 6 hour stay either! Terrible way to start my vacation!"
0,"One star. It's only because they won't let me give it zero stars. Read this carefully, if you book your room through a third party, such as Orbitz, they do not guarantee the room that you booked online. Traveled with my brother and booked a two double bed room and when we arrived all they had were rooms with a single king bed. Was told by the front desk I could get a roll away bed brought into the room at an extra charge of $10 a night if they had any available. Didn't matter whether they had any available or not because I had no intention of giving this place any more of my money. I travel often and I mean i travel a lot and this is the first time I have ever had this happen to me. I have stayed in nicer hotels at cheaper prices and haven't dealt with this kind of problem ever. Needless to say I have crossed all Hilton hotels off my traveling list. Also, room was tiny, small fridge, breakfast was not free where as in most places I stay it's complimentary. Bath tub floor was slick, tried to be careful didn't matter because I busted my you know what in the shower. Just an all around poor experience and I will not be back. One last thing, you hear everything that happens in the hallways no matter what's going on and that sucks when you are trying to sleep."
0,"The food CAN be pretty good here, but it can be downright awful, too. The service CAN be pretty good here, but it can be downright awful, too (especially at lunch time, when you think the staff would notice businessmen and women needing to eat and go). But most of the time this place just falls flat.\n\nAnd do yourself a favor: if you ever read the restaurant health inspections online, DON'T read the one for Hartigan's (nothing awful, but you have to wonder why they had a black mold problem in the ice machine for so long!)"
0,"The bartender downstairs was extremely rude. I guess if you don't \""look\"" gay, you don't receive service. So much for southern hospitality. I will not be returning."
0,"A few weeks ago, a few friends and myself rolled in here to check this place out.  I walked up to the bar and immediately ordered a bottled beer, which cost about 4 bucks which I thought was a little steep. \n\nI then proceeded to glance around the bar and almost immediately realized that we had made a poor decision. I'm no xenophobe, but a cursory glance of the bar area led me to believe that I was in the middle of a UN convention in uptown Charlotte.  I have no problems with \""gays and gangbangers\"" as reviewer Jason L referenced, but it is definitely not my crowd.\n\nThe bar is undersized, old, dirty, and generally an undesirable place to congregate.  \n\nOther reviews have commented on the attractiveness of the bartenders and I will not deny that, but if your sole reason for going to a bar is for the attractive women that work there, then I recommend going over to the establishment on E. Morehead St.\n\nNeedless to say, I will not be going back to this place."
0,"You may end up here on Sat night if all the other area bars are busy.\n\nI'm not going to come down too hard on this place because it wasn't my choice to come here. One of the locals led a group of guys here initially just to have 'one shot'. He lives in the Avenue and knows the bar owner and several of the staff.  We got quick and efficient service at a great price\nand ended up staying for a few rounds of beers after a round of shots.\n\nThis place is rough, watch your back, There is a lot of drama and the kind of place where testosterone mixed with alcohol can make for a volatile mix."
0,"What the hell, Phil's Tavern? Every time I come here (usually before a show), things just don't work out. I wanted them to, but they just didn't.\n\nFOOD: The only food I've tried here were the jalapano poppers, and then I never tried anything here again. How do you burn something in a deep fryer? Normally I'd just be impressed, but I was hungry. \n\nDRINKS: Their drink specials are nothing to write home about. The dirty martini was weak, and the tiny, shrivelled, Spanish olives skewerd on a coffee stir did not impress. At least it was only $5. Unfortunately, the Corona of the person I was with only cost fifty cents less than that. $4.50 for a warm Corona? Do not want.\n\nSERVICE: Nice, but few and far between.\n\nATMOSPHERE: Dank, dirty, sticky... these are only a few of the descriptors for this place. I fear the day where I will have no choice but to use the facilities here.\n\nOverall: \nDon't waste your time and money. I hear there's better places in this area, I just need to find them."

0,"I was really excited to checkout Brixx.  I had heard some great things about it.  We hit the 6th Street location.  My friends arrived before me and had their beers for 20 minutes.  10 minutes after I arrived, the waiter finally brought me a glass of water, then he flew off before we could order anything.  25 MINUTES later, we finally got his attention to request the bill. We had reached the point of frustration where we were so angry that we didn't want to order anything or give them our business.  The fastest part of the afternoon was when he brought the bill, waited and closed us out.  He did not receive a tip.  I have never had such a horrible experience at a restaurant in my entire life."
0,"I'd like to say it's a relative thing (I've had LOTS of really good and different types of pizza) but this was an ABSOLUTE thing - just really bad.  We had two pizzas - a classic (it was fine) and a new-age (Buffalo chicken).  The problems: crust had zero flavor, the ingredients covered MAYBE 30% of the surface and maybe that was a good thing because they too lacked any real flavor.\n\nAnd then there was the service - incredible slow with lots of excuses (sorry - the bar got really crazy....and there was nothing crazy about it).\n\nThe only thing good was the above par beer list which we were forced to wait FOREVER to get our beer.  Bizarre.\n\nDON\""T GO HERE!"

0,"The Goat Wagon Grocery has nothing going for it except its location. I shop here because it's the closest convenience store to my apartment.\n\nNegative experience #1:\n\nThe store reeked of marijuana. Smoking's fine, whatever floats your boat, but air the place out. You can also attempt to not look completely stoned on the job.\n\nNegative experience #2:\n\nMy girlfriend walked here to get change for laundry. The younger gentleman attending the store (the one who smokes) initially refused, saying the store didn't give change. First off, this isn't true; the older attendant gave me change before. Second, we shop here all the time, and everyone who works here recognizes us, including him. She offered to buy something to get change and he again refused, this time insisting he do her a favor by opening the cash register anyway. He was never this much of a wishy-washy jerk when we shop together."
0,"I was Extremely disappointed  with Capital Grille. I dine there during Queen's Feast Restaurant Week yesterday. i was very excited because i only heard good things about the place . To Start the evening off there weren't any seat left inside the restaurant so we were escorted to a dining room outside the lobby. There were so many terrible things that occur that evening where do i begin. First the ceasar salad was the worst salad i have ever had it taste like a 2 day old bag salad you get at your local grocery store. it wasn't fresh, i was missing courton in mine. Next it time for the entree.  2 of my  guest ask for a med-rare skin their  steak came   super well done . so dry i didn't know if i was filet mignon or A cheap dry roast beef.  She returned her and it came back out much better . I had the chicken breast that  once i got to the bone it blood and under cook.  and to finish the even off they were out of the cheesecake, and some of the guest  got the flourless coco cake which had molded rasphberry on her plate. yikes . it almost went in her mouth. I would have expect better quality of food for a 4 star restaurant.  She got her meal for free due to all the mistakes. but i didn't get antything for my bloody chicken. I will never go here again. :-("
0,This place is terrible. We chose to go out to eat here as we had only heard great things about Capital Grille. We will never return to this establishment for a meal again. \n\nOur waiter was very nice and the decor of the restaurant is beautiful as well. For starters I got the mozzarella basil tomato salad. It was pretty good so no complaints there. I chose the special of the night for my entree which was three small steaks prepared in three signature ways. I loved two of them the balsamic one was pretty bad but not inedible. Our water glasses were left empty several times which I thought was weird considering how much a meal like this costs. My husband ordered the porterhouse and he asked for it to be medium. Well it was bordering on the side of well-done and I tasted his and didn't like it at all. He thought it was very dry and it wasn't hot it seemed as though it had been sitting around before they brought it out to us. Honestly the steaks he grills from Teeter have more flavor than this dish. This was obviously very disappointing but we just thought ok not worth the money but we would possibly return for the specialty dishes at a future date. \n\nThe main reason I am giving a one star review is because I woke up in the middle of the night with awful stomach pains and have been sick for the past 10 hours. My husband was nauseas but not as sick as me.  We didn't sleep practically at all last night and because of this i would never ever return here. I would recommend grilling steaks on your own grill and not wasting a ton of money to get an underwhelming sickening experience.
0,"Went a year ago and had a great time, this time game was great we had tickets in the founders sections with the meal. Staff was new did really have their act together also rushed people out at the end of the night even with people backed up at the exits"
0,"Maybe it's because I went on a Thursday with colleagues, but apparently it's R&B night or Jazz night or something.  They play some old school CDs really loud so it's hard to maintain a decent conversation.  On top of that, it's old school CDs bc the music would skip.  We asked them to turn it down (off) and their response was: It's R&B night.  Uh, so who cares? Literally, there was us and 2 old cougars sitting at the bar - that's about it. Note: We were not sitting with these cougars, but the amount of times they were looking over at our table, I thought it was feeding time - feeling like a piece of meat, sheesh!  Hardly a R&B night if you ask me!  Beers were fine, I liked the multitude of screens.  But it's so dead on Thursday bc of Jazz Night!  Just giving them a heads up, let's trash that idea, yeah? :)  \n\nLol, 2 other corporate dudes walked in, was looking around, saw cougars + music skipping and peaced out.  We totally should have done that.\n\ndmo out."

0,"It's always iffy regarding the daily delivery of the paper.  The circulation and delivery staff are inept and incompetent.  When you try to speak with staff regarding this problem, the publisher hides behind a Philippines phone service who lie to you that a supervisor will call you back.  That never happens.  I spoke to my delivery person who gave me the name and number of her supervisor in Charlotte, a Miss D.  The D must stand for Don't Deliver, Don't Call back and DUH, because I have left messages for her more than 10 times and NEVER received a call back.  The only time they call you is when they want money.  I am also told by my delivery person that because I live on the east side of town, the publisher doesn't really care about what we think or providing a decent service.  I am calling for the resignation or firing of the Circulation Manager who allows this third world behavior to happen.  The publisher, Ann Caulkins, thinks this is the Philippines and conducts business that way.  You're a local paper missy, deal with us as locals."
0,"This had to be the worst newspaper in the world.  I have never dealt with such complete incompetence from a company.\n\nI had the paper delivered for a few months.  They don't call you or stop the paper, they just keep billing you for a few weeks.  Then they stop the paper.  Then they call you for what is a account status call.  Then you tell them, yes, I received a bill & I didn't pay it &  I was waiting for an updated bill.  And then you ask them how much you owe & they tell you they can't tell you that & to call their 800 (aka overseas) number.  \n\nYou call the overseas number & get a person who also can't answer any questions including what country are you in?\n\nI decided to email the company because I wanted some correspondence on paper since I was dealing with a pack of morons.   Oh, that was just another layer or idiots.  They email me telling me that I have to call their 800 number.  \n\nWhat happens next?  I get an email stating I owe them XX dollars until XX date.  I tell them I haven't rec'd the paper in weeks & have to restate this.  I get another email the next day replying with the current amount I owe & it has gone up because it's now including the past 24 hours that have gone by since my original email.  A different person replies to each email.\n\nThen what happens?  I get a paper delivered to me!\n\nNow I call them & of course their whole phone systems is out.\n\nFINALLY I get an email stating my account is closed.  \n\nEmail is answered in the US & the 800 number is the Phllippines if that helps out anyone else daring to subscribe.  \n\nI also previously left a message for some female supervisor in the Charlotte office & never got a return call. \n\nYou can't even look up your bill online - it does show you how much you have paid though.

0,"The last year of home delivery of this newspaper is the worst I have ever seen.  When you call to complain, you get someone in a foreign country who can do nothing to assist you with your issue.  I finally gave up and cancelled my subscription.  When I told the person on the phone I wanted to cancel it, she asked on what day.  Isn't that as simple as when my subscription expires?  \n\nGetting the paper at the convenience store is more reliable than the home delivery service of the Charlotte Observer."
0,"I was extremely disappointed! I went to Savannah Red back in 2005 for a Valentine's Day dinner. It wasn't awful back then but I have been back until a few weeks ago when my friends wanted to go for Restaurant week. I was surprised at the choice of restaurant - since it is not a popular spot in uptown but went along anyway. It was the worst dining experience I have had in a long time. The waitress hung on our chairs while taking orders, she kept making references to getting off of her shift and drinking at the bar and waited 15 to get drinks. After we had ordered we heard a loud crash from the kitchen, the waitress said \""yeah that was your food so it will take a while for some of you\"". Half of the table recieved their meal, while the rest of the table had to watch everyone eat. My girlfriend asked for a rare steak and it came out well-done! When she asked for a new steak the waitress, instead of appologizing she said \""well, I guess we will be waiting on 4 plates instead of 3\"". At the end of the meal the waitress said \""well I guess you will all want seperate checks\"" - as if she was annoyed. The entire meal was awful and took 3 hours! The waitress also added on 20% gratuity - which really irritated me. I will never go back to Savannah Red."
0,"The worst service ever.\n\nI was staying in the Charlotte Marriott - where Savannah Red is located - for the Democratic Convention. I worked on events at both Conventions having come from Tampa where the Republicans held theirs. I'd been in the concierge lounge with a couple friends where I'd had 2 drinks. We made our way down to the restaurant and sat at the bar to grab something to eat before we set out on our evening. We were having a fun conversation and laughing and when we ordered,  I was told I was cut off from having more to drink. Not my two friends but just me. It was the most bizarre thing ever. Never, ever had that happen. I was not drunk or unruly and the waitress and the manager refused to listen to reason. I wouldn't go back here if it was the last place on earth to eat."
0,Avoid this place at all costs. The food is disgusting. I honestly never had food this horrible in my entire life. From the frozen crab cakes to the unseasoned grouper.. my experience left me confused and hungry. This is simply a Marriott hotel restaurant - not an award winning restaurant by any means.
0,"Where do I start. It was a friend's 30th birthday so we wanted to go somewhere and light up a cigar to celebrate. Given Cutters is one of the few (if not only) indoor cigar smoking bars/options, your hands are kind of tied if you like cigars. I called (at 11pm) before going and was told last call was at 12:30 and the bar closes at 1am. At midnight, the waitress comes around for last call. When I ask what happened to 12:30 for last call, she says that the food and beverage director wants to shut down early - no other reason for the early closing. \n\n20 minutes later, a waitress comes over while we are finishing our cigar and drinks and says, \""Alright guys, you have to leave now\"" and opens the door. If this is customer service, I'd hate to see what customer disservice looks like. I guess paying $15 worth of cutting fees for the cigars we brought with us and purchasing several drinks was not enough to buy good customer service. \n\nWe were clearly unhappy about the way we were being treated but left anyway. On the way out, the waitress holding the door makes unnecessary comments about our slowness in leaving the bar at 12:20 (which should be open until 1am). The waitress and the food and beverage director proceed to follow us out of the hotel, ask if we were staying there and threatened to have us kicked off the property. The sad part is we had not spoken with the food and beverage director up until this point so instead of inquiring about our displeasure and what happened, he immediately jumps to conclusions. Needless to say, Marriott Charlotte City Center and Marriott's Corporate Customer Service center will be receiving letters regarding this incident and the customer service of its staff. \n\nI personally hope Cutters gets what it deserves and closes up. It gives Charlotte entertainment options a bad name and the customer service was the worst I've experienced in a long time. \nCutters does not have to worry about my patronage going forward and Marriott should be ashamed to have such poor customer service associated with its brand."
0,"Don't bother with this place. What a joke. We had a seat at the bar, no staff in sight. Waited about 15 - 20 minutes. Although two employees were milling about just around the corner, neither checked on the bar even once. Finally a waitress came out, brought a check to a table, walked behind the bar, fiddled with the dishwasher just a few feet away from us but never made eye contact. She proceeded to joke around with some customers at the other end of the bar, continuing to ignore us entirely. Fed up, we got up and left. \n\nBut wait, it gets better...moments later a different waitress came running out after us, asking if we'd paid for our tab. WTF???\n\nAvoid at all costs."
0,"Don't bother going. Walked in very excited to enjoy a cigar & watch the game. No TV's!  They said they didn't want to take away from their sports bar, which you can't smoke in. So I left. Horrible business model."
0,"Enjoyed being at the Bank of America Stadium but the usher in our section was a complete and total Ahole. We were sitting in section 513 in row 1A. As my buddy was walking up the steps, one of the teams ran a play, so my buddy stopped at the top of the steps so he wasn't blocking the vision of people in the seats as he went by. The Usher started screaming at him to sit down! No joke, not polite, or friendly just rude and a jerk. Then after my buddy sat down, the usher came over and started arguing with us. Really? I was completely floored by this guys behavior. Are theses the type of people you hire t be ambassadors to Charlotte? You might want to look a little longer for employees, or not hire toothless high school dropouts."
0,TRASH. \n\nI can't tell you about the bartenders. But I can let you know the door man and some other bounces are not pleasant. \n\nI've been here a few times. It compares to Dandelion but about 10 times trashier with staff who don't really care about there customers.
0,I hate this place especially the bouncer justin who refused to let me enter the establishment because I was wearing a UK polo. He said he was a unc fan and couldn't let me in because I would start stuff. I tired to talk to the manager before he laid his hands on me and threw me into the street nearly getting hit by a mini van. I tried calling management to express my opinion of the psychopath they have working the front door but the number does not work anymore. Further more I will never return because of the people this place chooses to hire.
0,"I was not very impressed with this place.  Walked in and immediately felt like I was working in a waste water treatment plant.  I cannot believe the employees can take the smell.

0,Worst experience I've ever had in my life at the Carolina place mall beware!!! The receptionists are very rude and one of them hung up on me before telling me that maybe she might get back to me? What kind of business are these people trying to run?
0,"I used to love Bruegger's bagels, but mainly for their salt bagel. They make the perfect roast beef sandwich on this particular bagel and they may have just signed their own death warrant with me if they've discontinued making them. It tastes pretty damn close to a Beef on Weck. I went to this location the other day and they had a \""pretzel\"" bagel in place of my beloved salt.  I did ask for the salt but they told me that they had the pretzel instead. I though, what the heck, I'll give it a try. Dammit...it comes nowhere close to the original! \n\nThe line got too crowded for me to go up there and air my grievance because I did have another complaint that must be addressed: SOUP! Brueggers used to have a wealth of soups that they would rotate on a daily basis. Now they only have 2! Chicken spaetzle or black bean! Every single time I go to this location, it's the same-old-same-old choices of soup! I realize it's Summer and maybe they don't move soup like they would during cooler weather, but if you're offering it...mix it up!!!! If you go on their site, they show they have about 8 different varieties but not this particular location. They used to have a delicious Velvet Veggie Cheese a few years ago, but discontinued it. I even complained about that online and just got a thank you/try our other soups bull$hit courtesy response.\n\nNo salt bagel is a deal breaker with me with Brueggers. The lack of soup varieties I can live with but killing one of my favorite sandwiches cannot be forgiven. I will return just to see for myself the next time if my precious salt bagel has been permanently replaced. If it has, I will stage a walkout...but nobody else will follow.\n\nThe WiFi sucks, too.\n\nThe only plus here is the friendly staff.\n\nYour sad pal,\nWalter"
0,"Horrible. This used to be a great place to grab some great breakfast and coffee, and despite it always being busy, the lines moved very quick and efficient.  \n\nIt appears now they have an entire new crew including new managers.  Service quality and speed went way down.  I've tried coming back several times thinking the new staff will eventually improve, but each time, I wait longer and longer in much shorter lines, and a majority of the bagel baskets are frequently empty, leaving only 2 or three choices.\n\nIt's clear I'm not the only one who has given up coming here frequently; this used to be a fun hangout spot as well, but now the few people that come in just get there food to go, as it is always empty (yet service is still very slow)"
0,"Buckhead Saloon; The Worst Jack-hole in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nBetween the overpriced bottled beer past its expiration date to the broken glass and urine on the floor to the snooty effeminate manager, this place should be avoided at all costs, unless your goal is to catch hepatitis. \nThe one time prior I visited this establishment I was let in with no cover even though it was relatively early, because as the guy at the door stated \""there are not enough good looking guys in there\"". The women were leaving in herds, so I walked in and saw exactly why. This place is what is wrong with the universe. Even if there is a semi-decent acoustic band playing, you would never hear them over the drunken squall of pseudo-urban rednecks that are just happy to be breathing. This is the type of place that would brag about being a meat market if it wasn't so wretched. Don't just take my word for it. Read the reviews by the \""guys\"" who gave it 4 stars and you will understand exactly what I mean. \nOn my second and last visit to this dumpster I was given a jagged bottle by the bartender and cut my lip (pictured above). I immediately took pictures of it and asked him to square it away, otherwise I can't control who would know about it. The \""manager\"" came over and basically called me a liar and kept trying to shake my hand for some reason. Some fat girl (who coincidentally muttered the \""n\"" word) was hi-fiving the manager and had informed him that I was just trying to scam the bar, even though I was still dabbing my mouth with the bloody napkin. I don't need this, seriously. If you do, or you think you do - by all means get jacked up at this bootleg Whiskey River wanna-be. Just wear closed shoes, expect racism and drink from a plastic cup."
0,"We just went here last night because of charlotte restaurant week and wanting to try a different upscale restaurant.  The experience was nothing close to nice or upscale.  We arrived and were promptly seated by a friendly hostess, A+ to the hostesses.\n\nIt took some minutes before our waiter came to us, friendly, but slow.  Kevin and I both ordered our appetizers, meal, and dessert all at once, along with a drink from the bar.  Kevin ordered soup and I ordered a salad.  Kevins soup came, no salad for me.  The server came by with bread and did not say a thing.  My salad finally arrives.  A few minutes later the server returns and mentions she is glad to see that I have my salad now and was wondering what happened to it.  Both the soup and the salad were good, but to eat starters separately should not happen.  After finishing, I finally get my bar drink, the server appologizes for it taking so long.\n\nNext to courses.  Kevin had lobster pasta and I had steak.  My steak was dropped off, but no steak knife was dropped off by our waiter, the person who dropped off the food, or anyone.  Waiter no where in sight, I flag down someone for a steak knife.  Aside from that, the steak was good, had a nice flavor.  Kevin liked his, but did not think it was anything special.\n\nWe finish the main course and are waiting around for some time, our waiter comes by and asks us if we want boxes, we say yes.  A couple minutes later a guy comes by with our desserts. He asked us of we were still working on our dinners, suprised to see them on the table.  We told him we were waiting on boxes.  He takes them away to box them.  A few minutes later our waiter comes with boxes, and is surprised to see our food gone.  Aside from that, the desserts were good.  The chocolate cake was rich, but great!\n\nOverall, I was not blown away by the food, and since the service and experience was awful, I will not be back.  If I'm going to pay a lot of money for dinner, it should all be great.  It was just like going to a mediocre restaurant, felt nothing like an upscale restaurant."
0,I Asked for a Mount and Balance from them and had a good laugh.  I buy my tires from the Tire Rack(online) and Goodyear quoted me $154 dollars just to put the tires on!\n\nI'd Highly recommend Kirby & Kale in the Elizabeth Area. They did the same service for $40.

0,DO NOT take your car here unless you want something messed up!!! Took my car in for an oil change and was told my brake fluids would need changing for an extra 75 bucks.  Saw the oil light on my car go off in a few weeks but took off getting it looked at for another few weeks.  Found a nice surpise later that the cap wasnt screwed on right from the last oil change and car had engine damage.  These guys are the WORST shop in Charlotte.

Took the car to the dealership who said only the rear brake pads needed to be replaced, I have at least a year left on the front pads.  They also said they could easily machine the rotors to remove the rust.\n\nTypical auto repair shop trying to steal money especially from young women.  DO NOT go to this shop."
0,"Dropped into Cosmos last night for dinner before the Michael Buble concert.  It was a nightmare.  First and foremost, they were serving a limited, special event menu.  Not a huge deal except the concept of a limited menu is to reduce the variety of entrees being prepped so you can get meals out of the kitchen faster when the place is packed.  Four diners at my table and all three entrees and my salad (more on that shortly) arrived at different times with the last one arriving 10 minutes after the first.  And brought to the table without apology.  \n\nSo why did I order a salad?  Becuase I wanted an entree with chicken as the protein and there was not a single chicken entree on the limited menu (I am not counting the chicken and shrimp jambalaya).  I also didn't appreciate that they served olives with the pits in a salad...a recipe for cracked or chipped dental work.  \n\nLastly, our waiter forgot our drinks and bread after several requests  and then messed up our bills (yes, we split checks...shame on us).  If you are going to go through the trouble of doing a special event menu to accomodate a crowd then round out the preparations by staffing appropriately (in the kitchen and the dining room)."

0,"In the tradition of full disclosure, I never really liked Quiznos that much anyway....I'm more of a Firehouse or Harris Teeter Hoagie guy, but the other day I was hungry on lunch and decided to give them a try.  The Roast Beef and cheddar looked pretty good.  But it wasn't.  It had a weird sort of taste, and with every other bite or so I would notice these odd little mushroom bits...you know like the canned mushrooms, and the seasoning and added flavors were not to my liking.  Not to mention the after effects....uggggh...never again Quiznos....never again."
0,"Uno Chicago Grill offers a terrific menu, including their irresistible Deep Dish Chicago-style Pizza where every last bite (including the crust!) is delicious. I've frequented Unos numerous times in multiple cities, including Orlando, Rochester & Syracuse NY, and, of course, the original Pizzeria Uno and Pizzeria Due in Chicago. However, the Uptown UNO in Charlotte is a disgrace to the UNO name. Twice now, we've attempted to eat there, only to be met with poor customer service skills at the hostess stand. The first time was an early evening, and there were about 10 people (different parties) in line, empty tables...and nobody being seated. After five minutes of not seeing any hostess, we left. The second time, we visited in the afternoon for lunch. We were pleased to see that there were people actually dining in there, several empty tables, and only one couple waiting to be seated. We watched as the first couple were seated. Needless to say, the one hostess on duty never returned. Having watched her every step of the way in seating the last couple, it seemed like she was just wandering through the restaurant aimlessly, not doing much of anything. And she never acknowledged us previously either. We waited for about five minutes, watching her, not doing much of anything. That's when I took action and walked over to her to remind her that we were waiting to be seated. She unenthusiastically walked back to the hostess stand with me. She looked around at the several empty tables and said, \""It'll be about 10 minutes.\"" Enough was enough. We left. Do yourself a favor: Go to UNO when you're in ANY other city except Charlotte!"
0,"My co-workers and I stopped by here because downtown Charlotte looks like a ghost town at night and didn't find anything too compelling from fellow yelper's so we went stopped here since we were all familiar with it. Hate writing about larger franchise restaurants but wanted to let people know about our horrible experience. \n\nThe wait staff seemed like we were a nuisance for patronizing their pizza shop and the attitude resonated for the duration of our meal. We sat outside where homeless people bummed for money and we saw a fight with plenty of profanity (felt bad for guests w/ kids) between a local and one of the bums who tried earlier to act like we bumped into him knocking his food on the sidewalk (expecting you would feel sorry for him and fork over some $$). \n\nWhen we ordered our waitress said \""I wouldn't get the soup right now\"" when one of us tried to order some which made us all question the safety/age of other menu items. \n\nThe food took forever to get and the waitress kept asking if we wanted more beer every time she came by. The beer she recommended \""Red Oak\"" a local beer didn't please any of our pallets which made the wait even longer. 4 of 5 orders came out with something wrong so (big surprise) so we just sucked it up and got out of there ASAP. \n\nI apologize for the long review but this place was so bad I had to share my experience\n\nDefinitely won't be back"
0,It reminded me of the dirty restroom at the gas station on HWY 40 driving through Texas. Dirty and nasty.
0,"This is the place for wanna be steelers fans. The bathrooms are terrible, and the place smells like a dirty ashtray.  the waitresses were very rude and didnt care about your orders. I was hoping for a better experience but oh we'll.... That's why I have found a much better place to watch all the games."
0,"Granted I haven't been in since my \""experience\"" I really don't have a desire to go back.\n\nThe night my friend and I decided to give it a whirl.. well, we drove up and the parking lot was full of Cadillacs and Buicks. Should have been a sign but we pulled up in the van and parked. \nThere was a very large, foreboding looking guy hanging out at the front door. Hmmm.. We walked up and he looked at us like, what are these two white girls doing here? We were wondering why until we stepped inside and every african american person in the building (which was all of them), swung around to look at us. It was, seriously, just like the old Westerns where the cowboy walks into the saloon and all of the crooks and criminals look up with daggers in their eyes. \nWe stood there, for a hot second, a guy started hitting on my friend so I pulled on her shirt sleeve and we literally backed out of there.\nI could feel people staring at the backs of our heads as we left.\n\nHmm.. maybe we were there on the wrong night.\n\n\n\n**For the record, because I'm sure someone will get offended... I am in no way racist and I would have LOVED to stay and party with everyone. The only reason we left was because we felt entirely, completely unwelcome."
0,"Rude staff, run down interior, not the safest place in town."
0,Very poor customer service. Have a special listed saying 10 items for 39.95 but if you have 11 items they charge you full price and you are not eligible for the cheaper rate. They also don't count your items and list the number on your claim check so if something is lost your out of luck. There are too many options in uptown. I will not try them again.
0,"Ruined a dress shirt that I took in with one small stain that I could live with, but I thought to give the cleaners a shot. Got my shirt back with ten or so stains just on the front. How does that happen?!  My husband picked it up without a warning and paid for it, completely unaware. First and last visit for me."
0,"Preferred Parking's rates are way too high.  We're parking in Charlotte, people, not San Francisco.  They actually want to charge me around $140/month to park in the lot near my building.  Are you kidding me?  That's what it cost to park in Chicago (and I used to work downtown).  I'm not sure if some people's companies subsidize their parking and that's why they are willing to support these crazy rates, but it just boggles my mind.  \n\nIn addition to their bad prices, their customer service is abysmal.  \nI used them for awhile when I first moved to Charlotte (parking far away from my workspace, so I could actually afford it).  But, abruptly, Preferred Parking sold the lot I parked in, never gave me any notice but did call me right before the transfer and rudely told me to find somewhere else to park.  More confusion ensued, and I ended up severing all ties with them and found another company's lot to park in. It's even further away, but worth it to no longer have to deal with Preferred Parking's bad prices and bad customer service."
0,"Terrible parking company.  The rates are high considering the location of their lots.  In addition, these lots provide no security or lighting in the evening.  The only PP person around is collecting money and giving tickets, so they could care less what it is going on in the lot.  The customer service is bad and the lady you usually speak to struggles with english.  It's unfortunate such a pathetic company has a monopoly over uptown parking."
0,"Want to let everyone know that, years later, Preferred Parking is still the pits. In a recent  display of lameness, they refused to clear out lots during the snowstorm for 3 days but then promptly sent their customers an email that they are planning to raise their monthly parking rates. If they weren't the ONLY company in Charlotte that had parking uptown, I would so so happily go to someone else. Unclear why there isn't any other competition here. So many people would be happy to throw anyone other than preferred parking their business."
0,"This is, by far, the most poorly managed parking company I've ever used.  I have been parking at the Epicentre Charlotte lot for the past two years and since the location was close to my office, I have swallowed rate increase after rate increase - and dealt with the fact that on any given day only half  of their entrances/exits are actually open and functioning...  this last increase (addtl. $20/month!) was the last straw and I have decided to move elsewhere.   \n\nHowever, cancelling my parking has turned into an even worse experience - not only can you only do this online - their staff has ZERO customer service service and they are charging me to cancel my parking. GOOD RIDDANCE."
0,"Be aware.  Be very aware.  There are other options in uptown Charlotte.  I suggest you use the other options. Extremely unethical business practices.  They'll ticket you for not paying (paying on app or online you could be a few minutes behind),  you'll return to your car, see ticket, and think...oh, we must have crossed paths.  Do this a couple of times, and the boot will be on your car to the tune of $195.00.  If the app doesn't work, they want you to pay at another parking lot (that would be yours to figure out) or pay cash.  If you call when you're paying late, the parkmobile people say, it's alright, we've got it noted.  But that's not the preferred parking office.  They will boot your car, charge you to park and charge you for the ticket.  I've parked with them for over 4 years, and this is the customer service they deliver.  The Manager also said she would not send anyone out to remove the boot, with payment, until I apologized to her and calmed down.  Blatantly against the law.  Yes, I have reported to BBB and the Attorney General's office.  It will be my life mission to unmask these thieves."
0,"The toenail in the carpeting and booger on the desk told me all I needed to know about the Omni.  I won't even go into the mildewy bathroom ceiling.  \nI can scarcely believe this is an Omni after staying at Pittsburg's Omni.  The lobby is beautiful, but they have a long way to go to be a decent hotel.  There are swatches out all over the place connoting a redecoration, but I wonder if it's all because the Ritz is being built across the street..."
0,"Wow...if you are familiar with the Omni in San Diego, or Dallas DO NOT come here expecting the same!! I would like to say this is a Holiday inn dressed up in a high rise but that would be doing a disservice to the Holiday Inn! The hotel feels old, rooms are tiny, and mustier than your grandma's basement. Beds feel like springy cement and AC rattles like a cage all through the night. I expected more from a name like Omni and pay per day Wifi! Are you serious it's??!! It's 2012!! Next time I will run not walk to the aloft down the street I only wish I knew there was one here sooner Omni Charlotte you get 1 star and 5 \""BOOOOOOOOOs\"""
0,"I recently stayed at the Omni in Charlotte, NC for the week of the Democratic National Convention. While the hotel has a great location and friendly staff, I slept on a cot for three nights and became infected with BEDBUGS and had to go to the ER when I got home today for treatment. First we thought it was fleas, then scabies but apparently it is really BEDBUGS....the WORST.  The hotel told me they were going to have to do \""tests\"" to be sure the bugs came from their hotel, but two doctors so far and my own common sense suggest I got them from bedding at the Omni. The hotel does not seem very interested in dealing with the situation either; I have talked to them many times this week and they have not told me about any corrective measures. BEWARE."
0,"Hair in the sheets and stain on the pillow! Yuk!!!!! I don't think they changed the sheets. Maybe the previous guest made the bed, so the roomkeeper left it? I don't know, but it gave me the creeps, and we looked closely at everything else and found everything grungy. On the surface, it looks OK, but OMG, it is GROSS!!!!!!!\n\nStaff was very curt bordering on rude. No smiles anywhere, just treated us like cattle - unwanted cattle at that. Don't dare ask for clean sheets..... you may become a \""problem guest\"" and get the hairy eyeball for the rest of your visit.\n\nIs it unreasonable to expect CLEAN SHEETS? This place is not cheap. I don't expect to be treated like royalty, but nor do I expect to be treated like a bum off the sttreet!!!!"
0,"As others have mentioned -- this hotel is extremely outdated. The location is perfect, however! The parking area opens directly (across the street) to the elevators that lead to the Epicenter. \n\nThe staff seemed ok, but it just could not make up for the room. Everything felt so old. Old towels, old decor, old carpet, old halls. \n\nI would not stay again, unless a major renovation takes place."
0,"Looks fine, seems fine, but it's not fine. The walls and doors are paper thin. We could hear people whispering down the hall (no exaggeration) and those enjoying their rooms in a more or less romantic way were known to all.... completely. This is a hotel with zero privacy- from the loud clubs outside heard throughout the night as if our hingeless window could open and was open, to the screams of ecstasy from the rooms behind us and across the hall. \n\nIf you join the select guest free membership be sure to ask the front desk what you get. There are perks but none were mentioned until we received the checkout bill in the morning under our door. I personally would have enjoyed free juice in the morning, or at least would have appreciated knowing it was an option. We will not be staying here again. Truly unfortunate as my partner is moving to this area and the Omni is in a wonderful location. \n\nStaff was friendly, can't tell you about the food or beverages since we never had any (though the completely and perpetually empty restaurant looked beautiful), parking was simple enough (garage is $15/day with in and out privileges or $22/day valet). \n\nWe wanted desperately to like this hotel, just didn't happen for us. Best of luck to those that go for it ;)"
0,"GROSS! \nI can not believe my experience with this hotel. I started getting rooms downtown when friends from out of town come in. I was at the Westin 2 weeks prior, which was amazing and a very great experience. So I thought hey for my friends birthday coming up more people are coming I want to get an even better place so the Omni I thought would be great and it's right next to epicenter were made reservations at Flemings...\n\nwe took pictures of how disgusting the room looked! There was a cockroach wing, not in a corner, but in an obvious position on the middle of the floor. The chair in the room was extremely dirty and stained. I stayed at the Westin just 2 weeks before and the Omni couldn't even hold a candle to that place. I have no idea why they are considered a nice hotel? It is THE worst room I have ever stayed in ever. \nThere is NOTHING modern about the hotel, there is a difference in vintage style and just plain and out of date. The last time I saw a bathroom this small and out of date was spring break in Panama city and that was a cheap last minute hotel we had to take but at least it was right on the beach. I don't care how close this is to epicenter, it's NOT worth the price.\nWe had friends from out of town that just couldn't believe how gross the room was. We only stayed one night. Thank God! \nThe front desk people were snarky and made you feel as if you were being judged, you have to walk by them any time you leave your room. The whole experience was awful and uncomfortable.\nI am going to post the pics"
0,"I wish I would've read the Yelp reviews prior to booking this hotel, because if I had, I would've stayed elsewhere. This hotel left so much to be desired, sadly. We arrived and went up to our room. Walked in and smelled the musty smell that other Yelpers described. The room was pretty clean but so so worn down for the price per night. See pictures for proof. I mean, a stain on a chair and bed skirt isn't acceptable when you're paying upwards of $300 for two nights. The water pressure was borderline painful and the shower head was very low. The bed was hard as rocks and very uncomfortable. There was an issue with parking as the machines weren't working this past Saturday morning. Finally, I told the guy at the desk I needed to go and to get me out of the deck however he could because I was in a wedding and was late at this point (because of their issue) to meet with the bridal party. Nothing was done to accommodate the crappy situation unfortunately. \n\nThis hotel is extremely loud and the walls are very thin. Some gals strolled in at 3am Sunday morning talking about strippers and we were listening to the bumping of Katy Perry's \""Roar\"" remix blasting from the EpiCenter all. night. long!!!!!! See night stands for ear plugs. \n\nWord to the wise: steer clear of this dump. Spend your money at a hotel that actually has good customer service and cares about the quality of their hotel."
0,"Made a reservation in May through Expedia, which I needed to cancel.  I called the hotel and cancelled, and was told I'd be charged a $25 cancellation fee.  Well, lo and behold, Oct 7, I saw a charge to my card for $435.00.  Called the hotel and was told that the charge was for the cancellation back in May.  I explained what happened and was told that there was nothing they could do.  \""who did you talk to\"", they asked?  Sure, I wrote that down and remembered it 6 months later.  Not.  So, obviously will not be staying there on future visits to Charlotte."
0,"I appreciate small, quaint bookstores and I understand that the big box Barnes & Nobles can be a bit frustrating. But there's a difference between a \""Mom 'n' Pop\"" book shop and a poorly-stocked one with books that pertain to a really limited scope of interest. I was in here early one weekday afternoon and I was the only person in the store. The few shelves of books they have at The Bookmark were somewhat sparsely stocked. The store has little atmosphere and seems out of place in Founder's Hall. I mean, I'm sure they could order whatever you'd like, but you'll need to wait a while and you'll also pay through the nose for it--publisher's price--because they do have to pay uptown rent after all. \n\nWhen I walk into a bookstore I like to be inspired to read and I want to be excited by what's on the shelves. I could spend hours in a Barnes & Noble just pulling interesting stuff off the shelves and perusing the pages. There's not really an opportunity for any of that at this place."
0,"AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THEY SERVE SALMONELLA!!!\n\nOur dining experience at this restaurant was the worst I can remember!  We sat for over :15 minutes with no waiter and only after we went to the hostess did the waiter show up.\n\nI ordered what the waiter claimed was their \""signature\"" dish, Paella Latorre.  It was served with ice cold mussels and the entire dish was less than warm.  I called over the waiter and explained.  :15 minutes later he returned with the dish and claimed the chef had \""re-heated\"" it.  While the plate was hot the food was still tepid.  I called the waiter over again and told him.  He argued that he \""saw\"" the chef reheat the food.  By this time, my business associate had almost completed his meal so I ate as much as I could and left about 1/3.\n\nWe told the waiter that we expected the restaurant to do something about the check.  He returned with the credit card receipt and said there was nothing he could do.  We called the manager to the table and he refused to see our point and said there was nothing he WOULD do.\n\nThe following week I contacted Blerim Meta, the General Manager of this restaurant as well as \""Aquavina\"".  He has also refused to do anything and also refused to apologize for the terrible experience.\n\nAVOID THIS RESTAURANT!!  AVOID AQUAVINA!!"
0,"Visited on Friday 3/25 for supper. I was really looking forward to a good Cajun meal. Out of fish on a Friday????  Are you kididng? And, crab soup so salty, was not edible. The waitress, who was really good, did not charge for it after complaining. Rice and beans pretty good, and wait staff quite attentive. I really did expect better. Will not be going there again."
0,"The in-laws were in town this past weekend, so we decided to show them the newly opened Romare Bearden Park. The park was a lot of fun and after checking it out we decided to stroll over to French Quarter for lunch. \n\nI had high hopes for French Quarter, given my love of Uptown restaurants and my affinity for Cajun-inspired food, but I have to say both the food and the customer service was a major letdown.\n\nOur server was not very attentive, forgot what we ordered, brought our food out without silverware and took several minutes to provide us with silverware so that we could actually eat, and failed to refill our drinks. The restaurant was also FREEZING... last Saturday was literally the nicest day of the year and they had the air on what had to be 65, totally unnecessary! \n\nOnce we were finally able to eat our food, it was a) cold from us not getting silverware for a few minutes and the restaurant being crazy cold & b) not that great. The gumbo tasted like it came from a can and the mashed potatoes tasted like they were instant.\n\nIf the food and service wasn't enough to leave a bad impression, the restrooms were disgusting and there was no toilet paper. I will definitely not be returning to French Quarter... which is a shame because they're in a primo location!"
0,"I've always enjoyed the food at Aquavina, so it's a shame that the lunch service is so horrible. \n\nI've had several bad experiences (we just kept giving it another chance for whatever reason). Here's the worst: I, along with a few friends, arrived there to have lunch on a work day. Eventually, the hostess returned to the front of the restaurant and seated us.Ten minutes passed and still, no server. Then the waiter finally arrived and we said we were ready to order (because we had had plenty of time to study the menu). Then, in a harsh tone, he said, \""We're really busy. Let me just get your drink orders.\"" Um, OK. Then several more minutes passed before we got our drinks and ordered our food. It took forever for the food to arrive. By the end of our meal, we were the only people left in the restaurant and it still took a long time to get our check. \n\nOne of my friends, who is not a confrontational person, even complained to the manager. He expressed no remorse and stared blankly at her. Then we finally left, about two hours after we arrived.\n\nIf you still want to try Aquavina, I'd suggest you order the black olive encrusted chicken breast with macaroni and goat cheese and tomato compote. At least your food will be good."
0,"My bosses used to drag me here for business get-togethers and meetings.\n\nI know it's hard to imagine hating a place where someone else has picked up the tab. But consistently, once the waiters figure out who's paying, if it's not you, forget it.\n\nBut I guess what the Aquavina staff can't figure out is, if they treat you badly when you're not paying, you won't return when it's your turn to pick up the tab. And I've had such consistently mediocre to bad service here, that will never happen.\n\nI once waited an hour for a drink and chips that never came, surrounded by a dozen people eating and drinking. What a lovely time. \n\nThat same night, asking the \""greeter\"" at the door to help find my party drew nothing but a blank stare, and I had to wander the place looking for them.\n\nIt's not always THAT bad, but it's never met expectations.\n\nFor the record: I've had lunch and attended social get-togethers there. It's been about two years since I've been there. The very last time I went, service was tolerable."
0,The lunch service is absolutely horrible.  I work in the building so my co-workers like to eat here.  Soda is always flat and service is very inconsistent.
0,"I used to love this restaurant and have brought out of town guest there for dinner in the past years but this restaurant has gone downhill and should no longer be in business.  My last visit was at lunch with other work colleagues a couple of weeks ago.  I ordered Seared Ahi Tuna Salad.  When it arrived, it was pretty obvious that the Ahi Tuna was old and on its way to being rancid.  I was appalled that any real Chef would ever serve anything that looked that bad.  I was in a business setting where I did not want to make a scene so I ate only the vegetables and did not touch the Tuna for fear of getting sick.  The waitress never ask me if there was anything wrong with my dish even though it should have been obvious to her that I pretty much left the fish untouched.  If you're Uptown, do yourself a favor and go to Halcyon, Mimosa Grille, Ruth Chris or Bernardin before going here for lunch."
0,"I was so looking forward to my birthday dinner at Aquavina on Sept 29, 2012.  What a disaster!  www.aquavina.com states the following:  \""Complimentary Valet service is available Monday through Saturday after 5pm, on College Street, between Stonewall & 2nd Street\"".  Upon going to this location, there was no valet parking, so we parked in the parking garage below the restaurant for a $5 charge.  Upon entering the restaurant we asked our waiter about the valet parking and he stated  \""there was no valet parking, but I will stamp a sheet of paper so you can be be reimbursed by the parking attendant when you leave.\""  Then the waiter brought our water, and poured from a pitcher.  Another couple said down a few minutes after us and they were asked by a different waiter if they wanted sparking water, bottled water or tap water. We were never given that option.  After this, it was quite a while before our waiter even came back to take our order. The other couple who arrived after us ordered and received their food before we did.  Once we ordered, my husband ordered filet mignon which came with asparagus.  He asked to substitute the asparagus (which was only two pieces) for macaroni and cheese and the waiter said that would be fine.  The meal came by someone other than our waiter and came with the asparagus.  He advised the food server he asked for mac and cheese, so this person said he would get the mac and cheese.  Several minutes later the server brought the mac and cheese and our waiter still had not been back to our table.  In addition, we had asked for an extra napkins and that was never delivered, so my husband asked the server to bring one which he did.  From the beginning to the end of our visit, we saw our waiter maybe three times., once to bring the water, once to take our order, once to bring the bill.  He did visit our table only once during our meal to see if all was o.k.  It was necessary to ask another waiter to bring a glass of wine.  Then we received the check and there was an additional $7 charge for the mac and cheese.  This was a substitution for the asparagus, not a side dish.  No one ever mentioned an additional $7.  We talked with the manager about this and in addition we discussed the non-existent service we had received.  The manager brought us a corrected check with an $11 discount.  The price for this meal was over $100 without the discount and without a tip.  So we were more than ready to leave asap,. We return to our vehicle with our validated stamp for the parking refund.  No attendant was to be found to refund our $5 parking charge.  I did call and speak with the manager regarding this and we were told I could come back to the restaurant and he would refund the $5.  Now really, would I want to re-visit this restaurant under any circumstances?  NOT IN A LIFETIME!!!  This is supposedly one of Charlotte's finest.....well our experience was not one of Charlotte's finest.  For this type of so-called upscale restaurant, what we experienced was less than the service one would receive at McDonald's.  My birthday dinner turned out to be a disaster."

0,I am not sure how someone thinks this food is great.  It is subpar and out of the freezer.  There is no way that this is Southern fare that is good or even tasteful.  Nothing is homemade and food is dry.  Service is nice and the lobby is good.  But please close and stop serving food that comes out of the freezer.  Grocery stores are always open.
0,"Okay, so my big beef here is not so much with this LOCATION of Bath and Body Works, but rather with Bath and Body Works as a company in general. Let me explain. \n\nFor starters, I just want to say that this store is clean, well-presented and has some very nice girls working in it. The scents of candles and lotions are incredible, and they were hard to resist with their Fall displays front and center with names like \""Autumn Leaves\"" and \""Cinnamon Pumpkin\"". Their prices are reasonable and their gift items are very nice. (Sigh)...so here's why I'll never shop here again. \n\nI came in to check out the store and in my browsing around, grabbed a tester for a particular scent and gave it a try. I always like to do this with lotions and perfumes; before I commit to purchasing, I put it on and walk around with it for a few hours to let it soak in since it always smells different than when you first put it on. So I left the store and for the next hour could not stop smelling my hands - it was so good it was intoxicating. I don't even remember which scent it was, but that's not important anyway. An hour and a half later I was back in the store and heading for the counter, bottle in hand. \n\nSo I'm reading the back. I'm trying to be ever so conscious about my purchases, especially beauty products, in that I only buy products that are paraben-free and NOT tested on animals. Call me uptight, but I just don't think animals should be tortured so I can smell like fake juniper. I scan the label and see that it does contain parabens, but it smells so friggin good I make an exception. Then I see it: \""This finished product not tested on animals.\"" And for a minute I think, Great! Ready to buy. And then...this...\""finished\"" product?  What the heck does that mean? Normally if a product is not tested on animals it will just say \""Not tested on animals\"", or \""We NEVER test our products on animals\"", or the like. And if it says nothing, you always assume that they do test on animals. But \""This FINISHED product\""? So, the final product that fills the bottle in my hand, the one that I intend to use, has not been tested on any animal. But what about everything before that? And then I just got mad. Very mad. Do they think we are idiots? Some big shot at BBW must believe that their customers are totally mindless, lazy, and can be easily fooled by the wording they chose. I don't know what made me more mad; the fact that they do test on animals, or the fact that they take us all for idiots and try to play like they don't run the tests. Either way, out of principle, I put the bottle back and decided I will never again give a dime of my money to BBW. Excuse the rant, but this just really pissed me off."
0,"From my one and only visit today so far, I rate this restaurant poorly because it took the server a long time to come to my table after I was seated. I ordered something on the menu called Sly Scottie because next to it in italics it said 'We're famous for this one!' It sounded okay: Turkey, broccoli, and cranberry sauce on top of a muffin (they mean English muffin). But when it came out it just looked like a bowl of lard. It also felt like I was eating a bowl of lard. I should have probably ordered from the diet menu. Haven't had this bad of an experience in a while."
0,"Pathetic, no other way to describe this brunch.\nI did have breakfast here once before and it wasn't this bad. Feel my pain: \n\n.....I get there on Sunday at 1:30pm after the rush was over. Their house special \""Eggs Benny\"" covers the whole front of the menu. I order that with a cup of black coffee. I get the coffee then my waitress disappears until 20 minutes later when she brings me my plate. I stop her from running off because the food looks suspicious. Sure enough the poached eggs were hard boiled. \""Is that too cooked for you?\"" YES.\n\nI wait and I wait and I wait ( just a few customers in the house) and a whole 15 minutes later she quickly drops off the new plate and runs off, NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN. It's been 35 minutes since I first ordered.\n\n One egg is borderline ok, the other is hard boiled again, the Hollandaise is dry and starting to curdle, the English muffins are not toasted properly and they're chewy as hell, the hash browns are absolutely tasteless. Not a micro-gram of salt, pepper, paprika, onions nothing to give it any flavor. \n\nNo waitress anywhere, not only mine but all the ladies wearing black tee-shirts are anywhere but in the dining room. After a few more minutes I lose patience, go to the counter find a waitress and ask her for my check.\n\nThe girl at the cash register asks me how was my meal and I tell her exactly how it went.... in detail. She is very very very sorry but doesn't offer to comp even the coffee. For maybe only the second or third time in my whole life I don't leave a tip. \n\nThe worst Eggs Benny I've ever had, coupled with ridiculously bad service: $15 and some change including a cup of coffee. That's right, over FIFTEEN DOLLARS for this.\n\nedit: check out the review that was filtered, I don't see why it was.  It reports a very similar experience to the one I had with the kitchen unable to cook the food right and the customer still being charged for it."
0,"NEVER USE THIS PLACE. DO NOT RECOMMEND. THEY DO NOT FOLLOW UP, ASSOCIATES ARE RUDE, AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS AWFUL. HARD TO BELIEVE HOW THEY STAY IN BUSINESS. I HAVE BEEN WAITING ON BOOKS FOR ALMOST TWO WEEKS AND WAS TOLD THEY WOULD ARRIVE IN TWO DAYS. DUE TO THEIR INCOMPETENCE I AM NOW HAVING TO DROP A CLASS.\nI am very upset and disappointed with the service that I have received. I was told by Frank the order would be placed on 8/27 and the order would arrive on 8/29.  Now, almost two weeks later, my order still has not arrived. And the order was placed on 8/28 instead of 8/27.  I have had to call every day to check on status, no one until today, after calling every day since last Friday has reached out to me. The customer service is not what I expected. These books were needed last Friday for a class that meets on Mondays.  I will be two weeks behind since they will not come in until this Monday. This is unacceptable. If I had known that, I would have used another company to receive my books on time. Now, I do not have time to obtain the books from any other source before Monday.  This has been a major inconvenience for me and I will know not to use your business in the future."
0,"You better run from this place.  The owner must be a crook!  Our house was burglarized and the police found our very expensive watch for sale at this store.  My husband went with the detective to pick up the watch and the owner was rude and arrogant.  The police told us multiple times that this business is well known for buying stolen goods off the street and they continue to buy items from criminals although the police keep coming to their store and identifying stolen goods.  If you buy something from these guys you better make sure it has papers, authenticity and can be verified that it wasn't stolen.  Too bad that a local business would do this to their own clientele."
0,"The worst !  Brookdale Drive - Rocky River....Always trying to get you to do another eye exam.  Took in my son's new prescription in June to make sunglasses. They wanted to do another eye exam today. They said it had been 2 years since last eye exam.  I explained to them -  I brought in the new prescription in June and you used it on his sunglasses.  The lady kept arguing. My son walked out. I called and finally had to hang up. Also, one other time I told them only an eye exam  not the doctor exam (due to diabetes) they went ahead and did the doctor exam after I was very clear with them not to do a doctor's exam. Had to have them take it off.  My husband's eye exam that was done here was wrong too. Had to pay to have another eye exam. Going elsewhere... Brookdale is the worst for customer service.\n\nLet me add:  Received a call from the manager, December this morning and she said my son did not tell them that he had sunglasses made in June.  I told her, yes he did and so did I on the phone.  I told December that they need to look in the computer and her reply was:  \""thank you for that tip\"".   Another unprofessional smart mouth.  All this could have been avoided if they knew how to use their computers.  Need some training in customer service too."
0,"HORRIBLE customer service. I was called at 7:30 am to schedule a service call (having not spoke to the company before) telling me they would be there in 2 hours.\n\nWe had a bad connection and got disconnected. When they called me back the gentleman said \""Get your damn phone fixed\"". Yes, I heard that.\n\nWhen I called this afternoon to schedule service I mentioned the disappointment with the call this morning. Jack (was the name I was given) said go find someone else for service, he did not want me as a customer. HOW RUDE!!!\n\nThis is the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Not a way to gain a new customer!!"
0,"My wife and I are having a problem with our washing machine, so we called a company that had been recommended to us. They didn't have any openings in their schedule, so they referred us to Carolina Appliance Service. We called on Monday, 12/17/12 and were told the technician would call us the morning of Friday, 12/21 between 7:00 and 7:30 am to inform us when he would arrive. My wife then confirmed her day off from work.\n\nBy 9:00, she had not received a phone call, so she called the company. The person answering the phone said he would find out what was going on and call back in 20 minutes. 40 minutes later, having not received a phone call, my wife called back, to be told that the technician had called in sick. She asked who would be taking his place for the service call, and was informed that no one would, since he is the only one who serves this area (Steele Creek, southwest Mecklenburg County) and that we would have to reschedule.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- Carolina Appliance Service set up a day to service our washing machine and failed to provide service on the day agreed upon.\n- Carolina Appliance Service did not call us to inform us that the technician was out sick, and apparently didn't even know their technician wasn't working until we called.\n- Carolina Appliance Service did not make an attempt to replace the technician with another, and placed the responsibility of handling the situation caused by this technician's illness onto us.\n\nIn addition, the representative on the phone (my wife spoke with the same man with each phone call) treated her as if it was a great inconvenience to him that he had to deal with her. When my wife asked if he had planned to call her to tell her that they would not be servicing our washing machine, he said, \""Well, he's sick,\"" as if the technician's illness absolves them of all responsibility of contacting their customers.\n\nEach interaction with this company suggests that they are an amateur organization who only deals with their customers when it is convenient to them to do so. I would love to comment on their actual service prowess, but given the difficulty we had in getting them to simply answer our questions on the phone, I doubt the day will ever come when we give them the chance to prove themselves in that category."
0,"I'd give this company zero stars if it were an option. \n\nCarolina appliance was sent by out Best Buy Geek Squad protection plan to fix our brand new dryer when it started overheating and making a scratching noise. They came quickly - only three days from when we reported the problem. They said they needed to order a part and would be back within 7 business days to install it. When two weeks go by, I called to check in. No one answered the phone during business hours. My husband called back later. Neither of our messages were returned. We called Best Buy who contacted them and requested they get in touch with us.  After about 15 phone calls from Best Buy, my husband, and myself, we just have up. Not one of these calls was ever returned and no one answers the phone during business hours so it is impossible to follow up. THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!\n\nNow we are working with another Geek Squad recommended company but having problems since our dryer was under warranty and the company already paid for the part Carolina Appliance ordered for our dryer (and is apparently holding hostage). Not to mention, it will now be another week and a half or two weeks for the part to come in again - leaving us without a dryer for a month and a half. I would never recommend this company to anyone. Probably the least professional business I've ever worked with. Beware!!"
0,"Wow- similar experience as other reviewers.  Purchased Lg\nDishwasher from Best Buy. On the 2nd load every it refused to turn off. Called LG and they sent Carolina  Appliance. First go around - not too bad. After it was fixed - same thing. LG and BEst Buy promised a replacement but Carolina appliance had to sign off on it as a lemon . \n\nthe owner was beyond rude!!!! Made many promises and failed to keep them. Claimed his repair guy  was out of cell range all day. \n\nHe started taunting me -Serves you right for shopping at Best Buy he says. Maybe you should call the Geek Squad.\n\nAsked hubs to call - 30 seconds into the the call, the guy is out if control. He get Threatened him and hung up. \n\nWe were also being held hostage by This guy at Carolina Appliance - as they won't release us so LG could assign another repairman. \n\nI'm really thinking this guy has some serious anger management issues!\n\nThe final result - DW was used two times- Best Buy took it back and we are waiting for our Bosch."
0,Very rude and unprofessional guy! Not willing to work out anything with the customer. Very short on the phone. I called for some appliance repair... Called back after almost a week and flat out said he was booked for over a week. He did not even offer to make an appointment after his busy time. Would not recommend this company to anyone.
0,"ZERO stars for this guy.  I called because we had a flood in our home, but when the floors were ripped up, the water mitigator said we had a problem with our dishwasher and needed to have it checked for leaks.  My home warranty company gave me the number to Carolina Appliance Service.  I left a message and got a call back right away.  When I told the guy my situation, he stopped me and said he was NOT interested in working with me because he was worried that if he did a bad job the insurance company would be coming after him.  He actually started an argument with me.  I assume he was the owner because he said \""my company\"".  But my simple question was 'Isn't that what you do?  Fix dishwashers?'...why is this company even on my home warranty's list of providers.  He argues so much that I didn't even get to tell him this wasn't part of an insurance claim.  So to recap...very rude, with obviously NO CONFIDENCE in his own work.  Don't call these guys."
0,"False advertisement on gas prices:\n\nThe gas price on the boards inside the store and in front of the store was different from the  price at the pump. After I pumped my gas, I realized that I was charged more.  The attendant told me that the prices on the pump are changed by the corporate office and the store doesn't always keep up with the boards.\nI called to speak to the manager and after being transferred, he/she never answered the phone.  There was no voicemail option.  This was the second time they tricked me. Grrr!"
0,"I called this Sam's Club to order some sheet cakes on behalf of a friend who is a member and was going to be the one picking up the cakes. The \""ladies\"" in the bakery who answered the phone were extremely rude and unhelpful, even when I asked to speak to a manager. I have never in my life encountered such awful customer service. I told them to forget it and that I was going to get cakes through a local grocery store chain... and I did. We will never use Sam's Club again."
0,I am so sick of Walmart and Sam's Club associates. My visit today at Sam's Club was beyond aggravating. I understand you have to have a membership to shop and I was going to apply for one today but soon as I walked in the door which was about 3:00pm this lady or so call greeter was very disrespectful and didn't even give me a chance to go get me a membership card. She kept asking if I had a card and I said no I going to apply for one right now. I wanted to cuss her out so bad but I didn't. And the next time she does something like that again I will tell her about herself. Both Walmart and Sam's Club need to learn valuable customer service.

0,I only go here if I have no other choice. This place is filthy and outdated. The bathrooms are yuck and this whole place should be redone! Nasty!
0,"Don't buy your tickets online! In fact, don't buy them at the gate either. Just stay away or you'd be greeted outside the gate of Carowinds by an evil blonde witch who somehow became a manager. Even proof of purchase isn't enough to prove that you brought the tickets, so you have to buy new tickets in front of her hideous face, just so you'll be able to enter and reenter (if you decide to leave the park and return later that same day). Staffs are disrespectful and don't want to help at all. \n\nGetting in cost an arm and a kidney. Drinks and food cost the rest of your other important body parts. \n\nLines are short and fast because the place is near empty. Most we had to wait was 10 minutes.\n\nEven so...\n\nAvoid! Go to Wet n' Wild Emerald Pointe Water Park instead!"
0,"just spent the day with my husband, 10 yr old son and his friend at carowinds. I now know why tix are so cheap. (37.50 through AAA per person) add to that $15 parking, $58 for 3 nasty burgers and cold fries, 2 slices of pizza and 2 kids milks, $9.48 for 2 sprites and it adds up quickly. if you only want to ride roller coasters, then this is the place for you. no other entertainment was available while we were there. off season I guess. won't make the 3 hour drive again from Charleston. would rather drive a little further and go south to universal. much better value for money spent."
0,"As a kid I remeber fallong down an open unmarked manhole, and not getting anything save a change of clothes and a freaking lollipop, they also refused to do anymore to compensate me. This also wasn't an emptied manhole, it was nearly overflowing. I will never go back to this park since this happened, and the lack of proper response."
0,My wife and I showed up the other weekend and got stuck on one of your rides that you lay down on. We we're stuck laying down tilted back on this roller coaster for about 20 minutes. Everyone on the ride was flipping out because we were all getting head rush. When we finally got off after your employees gave zero communication. We were told that if we would of shut up and listened we would of known that there were technical difficulties. Seriously who says that?\n\nThe medics there did nothing but give us a cup of water. After sitting my wife down for an hour to rest she actually became sick and was on the verge of passing out and all you guys could do was give her a free drink. \n\nOver 100$ worth of money spent to only have been there for a little over an hour. It was a waste of my day time and money. It was my wife's birthday and instead of being able to enjoy the day we had to leave because of the issues from the ride malfunctioning. A day looking forward to having some fun turns into a damn headache. It's sad when a park can only give you a drink for compensation.
0,My wife and I bought tickets online in advance to the park. We came on Halloween night for Scarowinds. Well we were here for 30 minutes before rain and lightning came. We went to guest services and they told us there are no refunds. If you plan on going to this park make sure to check the weather or kiss your $$ goodbye.
0,"If you already know what you need and are OK paying more for it here than any other place...  proceed.   They want to sell you anything regardless.\n\nI asked to have one tire patched.   The manager was unable to give me any estimate for over 20 minutes until my car was on the rack and the wheel was off the car.   I asked three times how much patches cost.  He reluctantly said they average $30 eventually.   So mine will be less?   \""Well, ummm...   no\""\n\nNo shit, my tire is an above average achiever.  After the tire engineer inspected my tires his opinion was that it couldn't be fixed because it was too close to the sidewall.  I found this amazing given I could see it was over 1 inch from the sidewall into the treads.   The manager then pushed a full set of tires my way for $850.   He was surprised when I had them put it all back and I drove away.       \n\nbtw - The same set of tires at another shop was $700 out the door.   The other shop also patched my tire for $20 and laughed at this story."
0,Worst customer service ever. The manager is rude and talks bad about the client and little care for his customer

After all, flea markets and yard sales typically deal in cash only.  I now feel slightly dirty."
0,"I have been going to this practice for yours.  Really liked my primary a lot.  That said, I have noticed that last year or so, they over-bill folks.  I went in for my checkup- the doctor spoke to me about high blood pressure.  No prescriptions were written, nothing outside of a BP test was done, yet they split-coded it as a separate visit/discussion than my annual.  $150.  I thought the purpose of my annual was to talk about stuff like that.  This practice and the associated hospital are there to make a $.  No customer service.  When I went in to discuss, I heard another patient checking in.  This time the attendant let them know anything out of basics annual check up routine, anything else discussed will be billed separately.  Clearly other folks complained and now they CYA at check-in.  I decided to get a copy of my records and find another practice.  2-months later, I get a $30 bill to photocopy my records.  To photocopy people.  Whatever happened to service and treating folks right.  This place looks at you as an ATM.  I wouldn't recommend folks to go here for lousy service, non-transparent billing, and you just never know what a letter from them will hold.  I don't think they really care about your health.  Its just a business model for them."
0,The doctor prescribed me medication that I am allergic to. It was in my chart and I told her about my allergy in person. I ended up in the emergency room. The practice manager does not seem to care about the issue and their whole staff is awful.
0,"I loathe these stores. The clothes are cheaply made. The prices aren't comaprable to the item. This is \""name brand\"" prices for crap clothing. The only reason I set foot in here is because my daughter got gift cards from relatives for Christmas. and for $50 she got a thin pair of jeans, a knit skirt and a thin black shirt. and we went over by 87 cent! OH and the jeans were on CLEARANCE for $15.99!!!! \n\nCRAP styles too, its like a clash between late 70's early 80's. DRAB DRAB DRAB.\n\nTheir shoes.................... are you kidding me? Pay less has better! and most of the time its BOGO so in the future i will sell the gift cards for cash!"
0,"Very curteous service but could not make up for a compltely lackluster dinner. Ordered the rib eye special with herbed gnocci and broccoli rabe.

This was my third and last meal there - three strikes and you are OUT! This CA girl knows better."

0,"So I just rushed home from Blue because I couldn't wait to get on here and give them this review.  Ok, I'm lying.  I made one stop on the way home - Barnes and Noble -  to buy a dictionary so I could find the words to explain just how bad this place was for me.  If not for it being restaurant week, thus having reduced pricing, I might have 'made a scene.'\n\nSo I'll start with a service review since I can sum it up with one simple fact: 2 hours and 15 minutes into dinner (restaurant week I remind you - simplified menu, 3 courses) we were still waiting on stuff to be brought to the table.  The service was atrocious and incredibly slow.  At the 2 hour and 15 minute mark, we finally just flagged down the waitress, told her to box up the food, box up the desserts that hadn't arrived yet, just so we could finally get the heck out of there.  Initially I thought this was part of the \""Blue experience,\"" but its not.  The waitress came by every 30 minutes, took the order for the next course, and it took an hour for each course to come out.  \nSo the food is boxed and i come home, nightmare over, right?  Wrong! they boxed up my friends food and gave it to me, boxed his up an gave it to the 3rd couple that was with us, etc, etc, etc.  So NOBODY went home with their own food.  I love my friends, but I'm not nibbling at their food scraps.  \n\nSo, food, how was the the food?  Not quite horrible, but not quite good either.  Edible is a better word for it.  I got the \""Grilled Niman Ranch Pork Rack Chop - with a Tuscan white gigante bean and kale ragout finished with a sweet Italian saba.\""  sounds fancy, eh?  Well, it was basically lukewarm vegetable soup, with a hint of chef boyardee, and a dinky pork chop dropped right in the middle.  It was so boring and bland, i question the chef's competence and would openly challenge him to a cook-off if this is as good as he could do.  I could walk into a grocery store blindfolded, randomly grab something, bring it home and microwave it for 3 minutes, and I would still like my chances.  Nobody at the table was impressed with anything they ordered.\n\nSo let's circle back for a second, and return to service.  The waitress was very nice and knowledgeable I have to say.  Maybe she was just over capacity?  I don't know.  But she recognized our frustration and had the manager bring our to-go boxes to us and apologize for the delays and long waits between courses (I think).  This is how that conversation went:\nManager: \""hey guys, sorry things took a little long, you know uh, restaurant week and the kitchen got backed up.  But how was everything?\""\nMe: \""Well, it was ok.  some things were pretty good i suppose, some better than others.\""\nManager: (blank stare)\nMe:  (awkward moment)\nManager; \""well sorry again, and uh i mean, you know ehhhh....\"" (blank stare).\nMe: (still awkward so I'm just going to stand up now and leave).\nManager: (blank stare and walks away).\n\nneedless to say, I will never come back here again.  If it were free, I would probably still pass.  If asked what could they do to make it right, i would respond with a full refund of the entire dinner, plus compensation for the 2 hours and 30 minutes of my life that I'll never get back."
0,"The food was literally inedible. We had calimari as our app & it was very yummy. We were excited about our entrees based on this course. My husband ordered the shrimp gnocchi dish. It tasted like orange peels-even the shrimp. There was a pesto sauce & orange rinds in the dish, which we thought was an interesting combo. I never tasted such an overwhelming orange dish in my life. Nothing had any other taste except orange zest. I had the duck, which was okay. Nothing to write home about. The duck was really rough & fatty. Came with a side of asparagus & rice. The veggies & rice were okay. I preferred them over the duck. For dessert, we ordered the cheesecake to split. We didn't even finish it. Would definitely NEVER go back"
0,"I am sorry to be writing this review.  My first visit to Blue a few years ago was fabulous.  The service was very good!  But, this time not only was the food not impressive, but it was totally boring! The calamari appetizer was good, but not worth $11.00.  The hummus appetizer was 2 golf ball sized clumps with almost no flavor.  Not even arranged to be appealing to the eye.  My tenderloin was nothing to write home about and the risotto was a mushy, tasteless ,  glob with Carmelized onions on it that looked reheated...also not  flavorful.  The baked in house bread were blah, and butter was not offered.  It could have used it to help the taste.  Dessert was the same...an amaretto cheesecake that tasted like it was left in the oven way too long....dry.   I love good food.  But, this evening was an utter disappointment.  It was a birthday celebration, and I did not want to spoil it with complaints about the food.  I also think my guest did not want me to feel bad for bringing them to this place I raved about prior to going. Service was great, but the server talked me out of a couple of things I considered getting.  Made me think whomever was doing the cooking that night...A Saturday was not good at certain things.  Extremely overpriced.  Btw...coffee was $6.50.  C'mon now!  Good but not that much!  Sorry, but I will not go back.  I was sooo looking forward to this special evening,  and it was an utter disappointment."
0,"Disappointed doesn't begin to explain. I now spent $350 on a bridesmaid dress that will never be worn. It is the wrong size, they won't alter it. They will do nothing and now I do not have a dress to wear at a wedding that is 2 1/2 weeks away. \nHailey the assistant manager is clueless and unhelpful. She knew nothing about the dress which is why it is wrong. So I thought maybe the manager Hannah would help. NOPE. Nothing. They even made the bride call the manufacturer herself, talk about poor customer service.\nI would NEVER recommend Nitsa's. I would even give it one star."
0,Totally disappointed in the service at this bridal boutique! Nobody would help us and they were eating in the back. Very snobby would NEVER recommend this boutique to any bride! The store was empty and they acted like they had no time for us!
0,Having limited options in Uptown I gave this place a few chances.  It's just not good.  I got some eel that wasn't fresh and I haven't been able to eat eel since.  I also think their miso soup is actually chicken broth with some miso tossed in.
0,"Probably the only restaurant that the service was so terrible that I have left before getting my food. Me and my boyfriend went here with a groupon, that we had purchased specifically for Fujo. They refused to take it, and the manager told us, \""you have two choices, ask for a refund from groupon or just eat here without it.\"" If we had been rude then I wouldn't be able to blame him, but we had politely and calmly spoke to them and asked about it. We walked out and went to Emzy for sushi instead and it had great service and excellent food."
0,"8 weeks and 2 days after my wife dropped an online class the ordeal of getting the refund is finally over. After weeks of unreturned phone calls, my wife had to get into her car and drive to the Harris campus. At this point we are 7 weeks into a long fight with CPCC to get the refund for the dropped class.\nShe finally got some information about the CPCC debit card that if the main campus had returned any of her many phone calls and explained the situation, this could have been over with weeks ago.\nYes she had the get the CPCC debit card, and it took a week to have it mailed to her but it can be used like any other debit card minus a 50cent per transaction fee that I am sure CPCC gets half as a kickback. We were going to just put it into our checking account, but had to fill out a long form, print it out then mail it to somewhere in CT and wait another week for the transaction to happen, so we did'nt go that route.\nBottom line is if you get any type of refund from CPCC take the debit card and dont go through the ordeal we did because you will get absolutely no help or customer service from the business office at CPCC at all."
0,HORRIBLE college. Good luck going there or getting help when you needi it. The only person I found to be helpful was Brad and he simply shouldnt have to do anybodies job.

I have never seen such a horrible COMMUNITY COLLEGE in my life time.

0,"While I hate nailing a place that has so few reviews, I'm afraid I have to give this place one star.  Some of you might say, \""well, what did you expect from a strip mall Chinese joint?\""  Well, some of the best Chinese food on the West Coast is in a strip mall or even in a bad part of town.  Sadly, this restaurant is not only shabby inside and out, but their food is just as shabby.\n\nTheir sauces taste bottled with a one-size fits all sort of technique:  pile on thick, gunky brown sauce on everything and call it Chinese.  Plates that are old and worn.  Dirty glasses.  Shelves that appeared thick with dust.  A faded \""Best of Charlotte\"" frame on the wall that dates back to many years ago. \n\nIt's sad to see a small business that just doesn't get it.  The food here falls short of the worst  Chinese food in a mall food court. That says it all."
0,If I could give this place zero stars I would. I ordered the generals chicken because you really can't mess that up. This place did. The red sauce that covered it was so sugary and gross that it tasted like it came from a can.  There was definitely not any white meat in my dish--only chewy fatty tissue that had some dark meat attached to it. The side of fried rice tasted fine but it didn't have any of the usual carrots or peas in it so it lacked in flavor. I have yet to find a really good Chinese take out in Charlotte.
0,Very dirty and disgusting. Sat down and he brought out egg noodles and duck sauce. Long black hair right on top. Got up and walked out.
0,"I wish zero stars were an option. I placed a delivery order and was told it would take 30-45 minutes to arrive. After waiting for 90 minutes and placing three calls to the store, my food arrived. When opening the bag, I had a feeling this food wasn't worth the wait. My beef/broccoli was chewy, cold, and unappetizing. I ate a few bites and tossed most of it in the trash. Do not eat at place and whatever you do, don't get their takeout service. Go to Tapei Express on Providence for great Chinese takeout."
0,"We used to go to the Emperor years ago with our young children and had fond memories of the place.  It was a mom & pop shop, nice ambiance and friendly service at good prices. \n\nAfter some shopping at the Metropolitan my husband wanted to go to the Emperor for a quick dinner.  There were no other diners in the restaurant.  Evidently this place is now pretty much a take-out joint, maybe has some lunch business, but is not longer a place to enjoy a sit down meal. We were gruffly greeted by the sole person at the desk, brought over some fried noodles and duck sauce while we considered the menu.  \n\nWe ordered the Szechuan Shrimp and Scallops and also the Shrimp in Garlic Sauce.  I will say that the food was plentiful and not bad, but I will never go back.  The place appears dirty, the service is not friendly.  Never asked if we needed or wanted anything else.  Didn't seem to care about having sit-down customers at all.  Just a bad experience all around.  Gross."
0,"This place is failing in every way: their service is dismal, their food is greasy/tasteless/disgusting, and the kitchen/dining room are absolutely filthy. I have no idea how or why they continue to remain in business, but I would suggest that if you ever must make the mistake of consuming this disgusting excuse for food, then for goodness sake dine in."
0,Worst auto bell in town. Do not go here. It wasn't even decent enough for one star.
0,"These guys took ME to the cleaner!\n\nI used this dry cleaner for the first time recently, and I was really disappointed.  I knew going in that they were expensive ($2 per laundered dress shirt), but it was a bit of a time-sensitive deal, so I went there, dropped off my shirts and a few suits.\n\nWhen I went back to pick up my stuff, the guy tried to ring me up for a total that sounded higher than it should have.  I asked him to see the itemized bill, he gave it to me, then, without saying anything at all, rang me up again for five dollars less.  No explanation, no apology.\n\nNo repeat business for these jokers.\n\nAnd by the way, I found a place at Pecan and Central that charges $1.50 for shirts."
0,"Went to get nails done for the panthers playoff game. Wanted a black base w/ blue stripes. The younger girl did them and did a bad job. The worst part she even told me it was \""not her best\"" and she was disappointed with how she did them. The lines were all different sizes. She made an excuse that the brush was too big. She was about 3/4 of the way done and about 4 woman came in to get their nails done...the girl decided to rush through my nails to quickly get me done, i guess she figured she had already screwed up so no need to keep trying. Then I sat to dry and the owner came and sprayed some kind of quick dry on them and it caused the paint to sort of bubble up......yeah and paid about double since it was a design...even though it was my regular nails.  Only reason I would go back is for a basic manicure or pedicure...hopefully couldn't mess that up."
0,"Been to Mamas dozens of times over the past 10 years.\nThe last few times out experience was just fair.\nLast night we went there for a birthday dinner...mistake\n1st thing they put the 7 of us in a small table for 6 max...how to you have any room for the food? DUH (plus the place was not even busy)\nThey did accommodate us after my request to put 2 tables together.\nWe ordered a few appetizers to start...one of them being the mozzarella and tomatoes, we ordered the big portion and asked for the red peppers addition as usual. The order came to the table with 3 small slices of mozzarella and banana peppers. I again had to request a correction. I don't mind paying restaurant markups...but come on a few tomatoes and the paltry amount of cheese for like 9 bucks...shame on you.\nWhen the entrees came the runner looks at us like make room. Of course the table was full because the the app and salad courses had not been cleared.\nGoing to a restaurant should not be about correcting step by step...it should be about having relaxing and fun time.\nThere are many good choices in Charlotte, unfortunately Mama Ricottas looks like it may no longer be one of them."
0,I do not have much to say about this place other than the food is horrible.\n\nthe people are nice but the food is horrible if you are itialian and the cook is not even itialian.\n\nstay away if you want real itialian food.
0,"They used to be so cool. Took money out of my account for late fees. Never notified me, never called NOTHING. This used to be a great place now  after years of supporting them i have had enough of argumentative cashiers acting mean."

I literally said to myself, \""I could go to Best Buy, but I'm going to go to Bigg's because I can't take a risk.\""  They sold me an accessory that didn't work for my camera!  I even questioned it because I said it didn't look right.  I expect that at Best Buy but not at Bigg's."
0,"I was at the Visulite Saturday night and it was a terrible experience. I bought tickets online 2 days prior to the show. It was listed as a headliner and that the doors opened at 8pm with 2 opening acts. We got there right on time and were denied entrance. Jam Base had listed it as one show and when I bought tickets on the Visulite website it was for 1 show. We were aggressively all told that we would have to pay for the first person on stage or we would have to come back later. What? Then we were told, \""it was made very clear on the website\"" at which point the guy whipped out his clip board and showed us some piece of paper and was like, \""don't make me pull up the website.\"" If it was made so clear... why were we having this discussion? To say the least, the guy taking/selling tickets was a jerk and the door guy was a total bully. He not only told said, \""are you talking about MY ticket guy in there? you better watch yourself or you won't be coming back!\"" Really? First of all, I'm a hard working polite female that does not deserve to be bullied around by some oaf that thinks HIS job is that important to keep squirrely little girls like me out of there. What am i going to do? kick him in the shins? tell him he's a meanie? there are better ways to handle a situation. Second, I was not talking back to this guy or arguing. I was trying to figure out why on earth I would have to buy separate tickets for 1 nights worth of music at the same venue. We ended up going to Crown Station (which is an awesome spot with very nice people) and headed back in time for the show. Again, the door guy was a bully saying, \""looks like you came back for a 2nd try, huh? you better watch yourself this time.\"" To say the least, I asked the bartender to speak to a manager and apparently there was not one there on this particular evening. I have to say, the bartender was extremely nice and apologized about 3 times over. This used to be my FAVORITE venue in Charlotte to see music, but after this terrible experience, I will not be returning. I remain very upset about this situation and can't imagine the band would be very happy knowing their fans are being bullied and talked down to at the front door. As for the sound... once we finally made it in, it was extremely loud and impossible to hear any words that the guys were actually singing. Super bummed about the whole evening... but would also be very willing to talk to a manager..."
0,"I have to disagree with these other reviews.  Presbyterian is a joke.  Unfortunately our primary care physician is right around the corner, and affiliated with Presbyterian as well, and so any time they want to order up something that they can't handle in the office, guess where they send us?\n\nTo make matters worse, the place is always full (or overfull), always understaffed, and always incapable of handling anything.  The emergency department is horrid, but to make matters worse, it's better than being admitted.\n\nIn one of the worst cases of mismanagement ever, what should have been a simple examination - passed from our regular doctor - ended up being at least 12 hours in the emergency room while we waited for a regular room, then several days (yes days) in the hospital itself while they proceeded to run a whopping one test per day.  That's right - one test per day!\n\nThe test would usually be run in mid-morning, and the results would come back mid-afternoon, at which point they would try and find someone to interpret the test results, which could take until after dinner, and by the time that happened, it would be night time, and then another test would be ordered for the next day.  It was simply pathetic.\n\nWhatever you do, do not go to the emergency room at Presbyterian."
0,HORRIBLE HOSPITAL!!!!!!!!!!!\nChecked my mother in for a cough via Emergency room. DR wanted to keep her overnight and staff told us a room was available. SEVEN HOURS LATER they took her up to a room....finally ER stopped waiting on someone to transport her and took her up to the room on her own....THE WORST SERVICE IMAGINABLE FOR A A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER!

The food was not to my liking at all.  Honestly and truly ...as I was eating I was reminded of the scene in National Lampoon's European Vacation when Clark and crew at the French restaurant near the Eiffel Tower.\n\nThe food tasted like it had been frozen and warmed up.  I have honestly had better RTE meals from Patel Brothers grocery store.  You know the type...the ones that come in the box for like 3 bucks....\n\nVery disappointed."
0,Really rude and non Indian people.....I have never had such a bad experience with any restaurant let alone Indian.....god bless them. I would be interested in seeing how long they can stay in business with this attitude.
0,"Was very disappointed with level of quality and service. Ordered to go and gave clear instructions to have two separate meals. Each with naan and rice and utensils for work. Arrived to find one bag. One rice and one naan. I pointed this out and they fixed it but they forgot the naan. Looked at $35!!!! Bill and saw they double charged for the naan too. The vindaloo chicken was not spicy enough and very oily. The employees spoke very little English and that was a huge barrier. They also seemed arrogant and rude. I am thinking that most of these reviews are fake or people do not know what good Indian is. This was the worst Indian I've had in Charlotte. At twice the price. I now know why this place is always empty.  I have also tried the lunch buffet and while the price was better. The spice was horrible. All bland, boring curries and an always empty naan bin. Had to ask to get naan.  This place is PERFECT if you have money to throw away and want mediocre Indian."
0,"Very few items on lunch buffet. On menu was aloo tikki, salad, plain rice, butter chicken, naan, chicken tandoori, chicken curry, palak paneer (paneer was hard to find), kheer (was good), finni that's it. None of the items were cooked properly. Very very disappointed. Price: $10.25 plate"
0,"Won't be back. I will preface my review by saying that I am a stickler for adequate customer service. That said, I have patronized this business at least 5 times with consistent experiences. The food is decent Indian food at a convenient location. The customer service however has been lacking each and every time. The straw that broke the camel's back for me was my entrance to the establishment today. As I approached the door, there was a server standing there who clearly saw me coming in. Instead of opening the door or at the very least, remaining to greet me, he turned and walked away. Once I entered there was no warm welcome (which I should not have expected given previous visits) but instead, I was rushed through to determine if I would stay for the buffet or if I was there to pick up takeout. I won't belabor the point, I will just reiterate that this was my last time spending money in a restaurant that does not appreciate my business. Their customer service is seriously lacking and the food is good at best but certainly nothing special."
0,"If I could, I would not give this place even 1 star.  The man that is there all the time, who is also the owner, ruined a silk skirt of mine and tried to blame it on anything and everything but him.  It was the worst customer service I have experienced in my life and that is no exaggeration.  He has extremely poor business skills and morals.  After a very long drawn out process  I received no apology, not even once.  He did give me the money to replace the skirt after me arguing with him on numerous occasions over a span of a few weeks and having to bring my husband with me.  When I also told him I wanted my skirt back to take it somewhere else, he lied to me and told me my skirt was not there any longer.  Luckily my husband saw the skirt laying on a table in the back and pointed it out to him.  We had to argue with him further because he said it was someone else's skirt.  This skirt is very unique looking and we knew it was mine.  After a few minutes he gave it to us in a rude huff and told us to \""just go!\"".  Anybody who lies like that I prefer not to ever deal with in any circumstance.  Do not give this man your business!  There are plenty of better dry cleaners in the charlotte area."
0,"This was absolutely terrible.  It was so highly reviewed, but absolutely terrible.  Not that we ate the food, because we never had a chance.  We were seated immediately in an area with another table that was served by our server.  There were only two tables taken in the restaurant and our server took 10+ minutes to bring us drinks.  Still waiting on our drinks, our appetizer came out with no silverware, no plates, still no drinks.  Our server came by (we had already asked him about the drinks once).  Shortly thereafter, he brought the drinks, still no plates and no silverware.  We waited a few more minutes and he brought out our salads.  Still no plates and no silverware.  When we asked again about the plates, he laughed as though we had made some strange request.  We continued to wait - no chopsticks, no silverware, no plates - after it became too ridiculous to handle we got up and walked out  It's the only place that we've ever done that before - and we have had some terrible service.  The food that we stared at looked terrible - in hindsight I'm glad that we had no utensils.  If you have an hour to kill, are looking for terrible service, aren't in a rush, and want to order some food that looks disgusting you may want to check it out; otherwise, stay away!"

0,"I have been to this place a few times and enjoyed the flavors. However I was VERY DISAPPOINTED for their lack of \""respect\"" to what a customer orders.  I order my usual the MEE GORENG with TOFU and as I combed through and had a couple of bites I found a strip of chicken.  I lost my appetite and was gravely disappointed by their lack of detail to a vegetarian dish.  This place is black listed for me and I hope to find a better Malaysian place in the Queen City."
0,"This review is about the FOOD only! I'm in town and without a vehicle so naturally I was looking up some tasty delivery options on yelp, when I came across cuisine malaya, I was elated to see that they delivered.  I got my food fast, both dishes came in very nice containers and I was sure i was in for a real treat! Based on other reviewers I had the steamed Popiah  and the beef Char kway teow..\n\nBack to the opening of the containers.... First the steamed popiah, I'll admit I have never had popiah before and they probably would have been better if they were fried.   The popiah consisted of a thick roll stuffed with mostly rice and some other ingredients, it was topped and garnished very nicely, the problem is.... It didn't taste like anything!!!  I'm a firm believer in not eating tasteless food.   \n\nThe char kway teow was similar in appearance to pad see ewe but again, this dish was tasteless..... I mean I couldn't taste any flavors! How does this even happen?? Did they forget to add flavor to my meal???  I ended up only eating a tiny amount of my food... \n\n It's so sad when you have something that looks delicious, but turns out to be a barrel of bland....."
0,"Always make sure to scrutinize a resturant review from a college student.\nIt's more than likely based on the cost of beers rather than food quality. \nMy sushi was warm, food was cold, and the chicken in my stir fry tasted old."
0,"My boyfriend and I have been coming to this place for a long time. The food was great and the service was great! Everything started to fall apart once the original manager was forced to quit his position. The food quantity and quality started to go down hill. There was hair in my food not once but TWICE every time I order a rice dish. The new owner did not care to apologize and he was offended I even brought it up. The sushi is very plain and not high quality either. As a college student, they forget to discount our meal from time to time but its the food that matters right? Their prices are constantly changing and for the amount of the food it is not reasonable. We will not be coming back at all. There are other places to go that actually care about their customers satisfaction."
0,"This is the worst Chinese restaurant that I have ever eaten at.  I went here because of the good reviews but was very disappointed.  I don't write many reviews, but I didn't want someone to get suckered in like I did.  \n\nThe one good thing that I will say about this restaurant was that the food was very cheap.  However, I could not stomach but a few bites so I still did not get my money's worth."
0,"After driving by everyday for months I finally stopped in for a sub and was completely unimpressed. Even though the shop was nearly empty, the staff was indifferent and they forgot what I ordered multiple times.\n\nThe chicken parm sub I ordered was a hot bland mess. Instead of crispy breaded chicken inside, it had plain unseasoned chicken slices which was covered in cheese and a sauce one step away from ketchup. To top it all off the sub was microwaved, which made the inside insanely hot and turned to bread to rubber.\n\nMaybe their regulars subs are better, but the next time I spend $10 on a sub and soda, it definitely won't be here."

They sent me an email confirmation saying it would be 30-40 minutes, which obviously wasn't the case. When I called to inquire after an hour they simply said it was on it's way, no offer for a coupon or a comp pizza or anything. After taking one bite I'm less than satisfied. It's cold and completely unimpressive. To top it off when I had to sign my credit card receipt the delivery person asked me if thy could have my pen bc they left there's at home. I will never order from them again. There are far too many BETTER pizza places to indulge in."

Go to Domino's if this is your Papa Johns for your area.  I don't even like Domino's and order there now because this place disgusted me so much."
0,"Worst experience with Papa Johns ever with this location. \n\nEvery* time I've ordered delivery it has been incredibly late. This past time was the worst. An order estimated at 30 minutes still wasn't here 1.5 hours later so I called and they claimed it had just left. They called up from the call box once and then left within seconds. (For whatever reason it went straight to voicemail, which I got notification of immediately.) I literally ran down and circled the lot and they were long gone. The store then pretended they couldn't hear me when I called from numerous phones and numbers until finally I interrupted their speech about the promotion and called them out for stuttering since they clearly heard me. (Before that they'd say the special really fast and immediately say \""hello? hello?\"" and hang up.) I will never order from this location again."

0,"My boyfriend and I have been to Ho Ho Cherry House a couple times because its right up the street from our house. On a recent visit to pick up our order, I happened to notice there was a coupon in their to go menu I had picked up.  The coupon was spend 15, get 5 off. I asked the MANAGER, \""hey, can we please use this coupon?\""  The manager said, \""did you just pick that up off my counter?\"" Playfully I said, \""umm, noooo\"" thinking there was no way he was going to deny us the coupon.. (remember, talking to the manager, not a teenager in the front.)  He then proceeded to tell us that no we couldn't use the coupon, and we would have to take the coupon home, cut it, and use it on our next visit. \n\nI said I couldn't believe that, and that if there was some sort of parameter of that sense it should be clearly stated on the to-go menu. When he finally refused, I said under my breath, \""guess we'll be going down the street to 88 Bistro.\"" to which he had the nerve to reply, \""yeah, I heard that place is great, have you been?\"" What a jackass. If directly disrespecting your customers is how you run your business, then I will be happy to support your competitor."

0,"My experience with Morehead Inn was by far the biggest disappointments I endured as a bride. I do not want another couple to have to go through what we went through with them. MHI was recommended by my wedding Planner, Angela, who told us that they would accommodate our every need.  This was important to us b/c would be showcasing my Lao culture, which means the food above all else had to be precise. In Sept 2013, we went to go visit the space and the Coordinator there, Jackie, told us that the Chef would be able to customize our menu & if there are dishes that he wouldn't be able to replicate, they would allow for outside catering. \nIn Nov 2013, Angela followed up with MHI to see when we could schedule the tasting. She came back to us and said that Jackie had left the company. They were understaffed, hitting the holiday season, & were too busy to accommodate us at that time. We understood and agreed to have a tasting no later than the 1st first week of Jan 2014. Our wedding was going to in April 2014. \nOn Jan 15th we finally received an email from their new Coordinator, Kaylie, who said that the Chef would be ready to provide us a tasting on Feb 4th, a month late. She said that we have to rent them a fryer, would NOT allow any outside catering & would have to pay for each of our tasting; which was not stated on the contract. \nThe first tasting did not meet our standards, so we suggested that the Kaylie and Chef go to our friend's restaurant to try the food that we wanted them to make. At first, the Chef did not want to comply but finally said ok. We wanted the experience to be good for both so we paid for their lunch. I went back for 4 tastings and the dishes finally came out decent but far from the traditional flavors. \nApril 4th was the date that the final head count was due as well as the remaining balance. The invoice amount was wrong & it showed us being charged for the tasting. Angela she said that she would consult with Billy and Kaylie. She told me not to pay & said that we would clear the issue by the weekend. She also told me that she worked on a wedding with them in the past where the couple did not pay MHI until the day of their wedding so we should be fine. \nWe received the revised invoice over the weekend and upon reviewing it w/ Angela; we were not able to conclude how they came up with the calculation. April 7th I asked Kaylie to revise it so I knew exactly what I was being charged for. She said that the Accounting Dept would not be able to provide this for me but that if we got overcharged, they would refund us after the wedding.  So essentially, they ask us to pay them based on good faith but the ironic thing is that there was no good faith on their part b/c what happened next is obvious who Billy, the owner, is and how he treats his clients. \nWe agreed to make the pymt on April 8th even though we didn't agree with the amount we were charged for. I emailed Kaylie that morning and said that my fianc\u00e9 would call her with the credit card number, which she told us was ok to do.  By midday, we received an email from Kaylie who said that Billy told her to tell us that they would no longer take our credit card and that the only form of pymt he would accept would be cash or cashier's check or our event would be cancelled. We were shocked by this since our agreement stated that credit card is the appropriate form of pymt.  We sent Billy our cc info & told him that he could run the transaction since that was a valid form of payment in our contract.  The next day he sent us a threatening email demanding cash and that he would take us to court b/c we breached our contract by cancelling our event. We reminded him that he was the one that said our event would be cancelled if we didn't provide the other form of payment and because of his nasty behavior; we did not want do business with him anymore. On April 10th he ran our credit card without notifying us and told Angela that we could still have our event there.  We were livid that Billy charged our card after he cancelled our event and demanded we pay him in cash. \nWe ended up having to pay them the $6k but we did not have our event with them because we could not trust them after all this.  We had to scramble the week of the wedding to move our event to the Holiday Inn who did a great job accommodating us in such a short notice.    \nLast I would like to say that our wedding was over six figures so we expected a certain level of service from our vendors.   The way we were treated caused my fianc\u00e9 and I so much stress during our final days before our big day.  For all those who fall in love with the MHI, let me forewarn you that the owner Billy is not someone who you can depend on to treat you like a bride deserves.  Feel free to contact me for details."
0,"This was one of the vendors that came highly recommended by my wedding Planner. She could not stress enough how great and accommodating they were. From our first meeting with their Event Coordinator, we were lead to believe that MHI would offer outside catering if they were not able to customize our menu. We wanted traditional Laotian food. They said that this was possible and so we signed. Everything that transpired from that moment went downhill. They did not keep their promise and so we had to work with the Chef to prepare our dishes. After several tastings that we were billed for (it was never stated on our contract  that we had to pay for these), the food came out ok. \n\nThe final straw was 2 weeks before our wedding when we got the bill that was to be paid in full,  which was completely inaccurate. They tried to explain to us and our wedding planner what the breakdown of cost was but nothing on that invoice made sense. My planner told us to hold off on paying until she spoke to Billy, the owner. She also mentioned that they had allowed a couple to pay on the day of so we should be ok. After several back and forth, we decided to proceed on the payment even though we didn't agree with the amount.  MHI Planner emailed us midday and said the owner, Billy, would not accept our credit card and demanded we paid him cash or money order in full or our event would be cancelled. We told him that the contract explicitly states that a cc is an acceptable form of payment and that he could take. He said that he would take us to court and sue us if we didn't pay. We were under the notion that he was going to cancel our event b/c we refused to give in to his demands but two days later he ran our credit card w/o our knowledge and called our planner to let us know all is well & that we could have our wedding day. We never got our money back and we ended up not having our wedding there. I don't think any bride & groom who endured what we did would want to have their wedding there as well. We had to find a new venue at the last minute and rejigger our wedding day schedule because of Billy. \n\nFolks - there is something sketchy when a business owner demands you pay in cash when the contract doesn't state that. Please beware of this. I have all of our correspondences saved if anyone wants to see them."
0,"My family and I ordered take out from here regularly and loved them. However, one time I noticed they had double-charged my credit card.

I got the confirmation email clearly stating our order, time it was placed, house address, etc.\n\nThe lady on the phone at first was very helpful and say we wouldn't need to pay.

0,"Visiting Charlotte from Los Angeles while husband is in town for business. \n\nThe good: The upstairs dining room has a live band and lively atmosphere. People are talking loud and enjoying themselves. Have a drink before your dinner comes for an even better time. We each had a glass of wine. The sauce from the barbeque shrimp was the best part of our meal. Not the shrimp, the sauce with bread dipped in.\n\nThe bad: Food is mediocre. We had the Cajun popcorn, which is fried crawfish that comes out partially covered in a remoulade sauce. Good, but on the salty side. Tell them to put the sauce on the side when you order so you can dip instead. The sauce took away from the dish and the ones that were smothered in the sauce remained on the place, uneaten. We each had a cup of seafood gumbo, There is no meat other than seafood in the gumbo (yay!) but it was bland and the rice seemed undercooked and flavorless. We ordered a large order of the barbeque shrimp and I got a side order of grits. The sauce in the barbeque shrimp was spicy and delicious; dip the bread from your bread basket in this tasty broth. The shrimp were on the small and limp side; not memorable at all as far as texture. \n\nThe final insult: the grits. Grits are a favorite food of mine. I'm a southern girl and make real deal, bomb-azz grits at home. The grits at Cajun Queen were those instant, \""add boiling water to reconstitute,\"" grits. Culinary blasphemy.\n\nI will not return. If you want real grits, go to Mert's Heart and Soul."
0,"So incredibly let down by this dining experience. Our waiter was simultaneously overbearing and absent-minded. Half of our table got their meals 10-15 mins before the other half and the waiter forgot to bring two of us our desserts. Meanwhile, the food was terrible. The fried green tomatoes lacked any kind of seasoning and the crawfish etouffee was bland and not at all spicy. The tollhouse cookie pie was also a travesty. How does one mess up a cookie pie?! At least the key lime pie was good, but not worth the $250 dollar bill :("
0,"Do not waste your money! The gumbo tasted like the roux had burned and there was no salt whatsoever. I ordered the blackened chicken to be safe thinking \""no one can mess up blackened chicken\"".....I was wrong. None of the food (including the blackened chicken) were seasoned with salt and pepper. This was the most bland, overpriced food I'd ever had in the city. I ordered my toddler the chicken strip little gators meal. The fries were the best thing out of the entire meal. The service was as also dry and not very friendly or inviting from the hostess to the waiter, Brandon. Geez, I know it's a Tuesday night (we arrived at 5:30) but at least show some enthusiasm as I arrive to spend a whopping $123 (4 entrees, 4 alcoholic bevs, 1 kids meal) on a below average meal. It would've been more had we been charged for the uneaten cup of gumbo."
0,"I take everyone that comes to visit me to Cajun Queen!  From the great food (my favorite is the bbq shrimp and bread to dip into the sauce), to the live jazz and great service, this is a restaurant not to be missed!"
0,"DISABLED PEOPLE, PLEASE BEWARE\n\n I've been a patron of Cajun Queen for over a decade but my experience tonight was humiliating. I treated my sister to  a birthday dinner and despite our online reservation, we were asked to leave in  the most demeaning of ways. I have a debilitating childhood disease and use a wheelchair on occasion ; tonight was one such occasion. I could only order food I knew didn't require cutting, so I opted for potatoes and a salad. My sister ordered a full meal with wine. I had two mixed drinks (so we're not cheap diners). We had to signal for another glass of wine for my sister, despite seeing the party next to us being served appropriately. \n\nI'm not sure why we were overlooked but I'm left to wonder if it's the small portion I ordered that was disparaging.\n\nAnyway, when my sister went to look upstairs a minute to reminisce, our server asked my sister quite off the cuff, \""Do you want help with 'her' (wheel)chair? I kinda need that table.\""\n\nTaken aback, my sister said, \""No.\"" \n\nWe took note of the EMPTY tables on BOTH sides of us and the fact that the restaurant wasn't crazy busy as we remembered. \n\nI spent $67 on a tab for two  and left a TIP of $20--clearly more than twenty percent.\n\nI don't know many people who tip as graciously as I  do. My reasoning for leaving the tip despite the service, was it being Christmas time and it's something I do for goodwill.\n\nWhen we rolled to the handicap ramp, it was completely (I mean, completely) blocked off by an A-frame sign about parking; see for yourself. Had  my sister not been with me, I would have not been able to access the restaurant at all.\n\nI haven't  always been disabled and ran a restaurant, myself (loved every minute of it). I know how people can take advantage (campers) and I know people can be uber-cheap at tipping. I don't fall into  either ilk. I know good service when I see it; I know how to approach diners who overstay their 'welcome (their can NEVER be anyone who overstay their welcome; consider it flattery); it's part of doing business and keeping patrons happy.  Take a loss here and there. \n\nWe were in and HOME in a little over two hours. The couple beside us with the adorable little girl who  laid all over the booth was fine by me; she's a child and CQ is a noisy place. \n\nI felt a sting of angst when I asked for my food to be wrapped. The facial gestures were quite unsettling.\n\nPlease don't tell me I'm sensitive: I've had over FORTY surgeries--TWO with NO painkillers afterwards. I've walked on a BROKEN leg to buy wrapping paper tape been accosted because I wasn't 'messed up' \""enough'\"" to ''deserve a handicap tag. \n\nSo enough ---but there's  no excuse for inhospitably between diner and those needing  to use the facilities.''PLeASe let these be a isolated parents.'\n\nPLEASE LEAVE :)"
0,"Very loud, bad service, and the food doesn't met the expectations. We came w a party of 10 people, we didn't even get menus for a while, it was so loud we could hardly listen to our server. Dirty plates were sitting in our table for a long time. Super disappointed"
0,"The owner could care less about customers. He is the rudest man. The food is so so. Nothing Cajun about it. They did not use our Groupon correctly. That was fine with us, but why couldn't the server tell us. Not just toss the bill on the table and walk away. Save your money and dine elsewhere. The Cajun Yard Dog is far better, and far more Cajun cuisine."
0,"NOTE: Unlike BOA, I am happy to be contacted about my experiences and will speak to everyone who wants to hear more about my nightmare, below. Any of you (including you, BOA) can reach me at joltin@aol.com (please subject any emails, \""BOA ISSUE\"" or I may not see). BOA, its people and these kind of systems are deliberately engineering the US economy to take money away from those who can least afford it. \n\nFIGHT BACK!!\n\n-------------------\n\nOMG!!!\n\nWhat a ripoff!!!! They systematically steal our money in the form of government handouts and then, because they need more to fund their crooked system, come at us all individually. This is bold-faced theft and the individuals involved should really be criminally charged - yes Tara Tatro - this includes you!\n\nAnyone know a good attorney?--seems like we might have enough for a class action. \n\nMICHAEL  MOORE - GOT A SUBJECT FOR YOU!!! \n\nMy background: \nI had a $7,000 credit limit w BOA and have had zero late payments on my account for at least 2 years. During the last year I maintained a higher balance-  in the$ 6,000 area. As I've moved into cleaning up my finances, I paid off BOA. IMMEDIATELY, they lowered my credit line a crazy amount. Not to $5,000, not $3000 but to $500 dollars in July 2009 - a 93% credit line decrease!!! How can  you even pretend to justify this? In the end, they claimed that they re-reviewed my credit and this is what they came up with - despite my always paying on time. Keep in mind, my credit has had NO new negative entries in over two years!!!\n\nWhat does this mean ?- It means BOA was happy has a cow to charge my 20+% interest on a 6,000 balance (about $250 per month) but then once I paid it down -restrict my access to the charge card.  WAIT A MINUTE!!! So if you accept I paid them this interest for a year, they've stolen $3,000 from me and now won't let me ( a proven paying customer) charge anything anymore. AND because they've lowered my credit line, they've lowered my credit utilization percentage and hence my further access to the credit market - think home purchase.\n\nCan you see how they trap you?\n\nSo, I call Customer Service to complain... their response? \""Tough\""... argh.... Next step, I go visit a branch to have this explained to me. The branch GM is very nice, researches it with his resources and comes back with the answer that he is sorry but doesn't know how this happened or the rationale. He asks me to let him know what I find out. \n\nDouble ARGH!!!!! Think about that, the branch manager is asking me to figure out what's going on with this thieving company!!!\n\nSo, then I call the corporate offices in Charlotte and ask to speak to the VP of Customer Relations. The operator informs me that they can't put any callers through to any executives. Given we (taxpayers) just gave them how many zillion, this seems very strange to me I tell her. The operator is very nice says that she understood but she is systemically prevented from transferring a call or giving out a phone # for executives. \n\nWOW!! Its like Bank Of Darth Vader - isn't it?\n\nSo, then I try this executive customer service line (704-386-5687 - thank you Consumerist!!!). I initially get a very nice lady named Melanie who promises me that they'll be able to fix the situation. She then transfers me to a Tara Tatro (she sounds very young and is quick with the insults). When I ask her title, she tells me her title is \""works in the Office of the Chairman  & CEO\"" and refuses to give me any more info.  (BTW, Did you know this exec customer service department is Tampa? Why does Ken Lewis need to have an office that reports directly to him in Tampa - Winter home???)\n\nShe looks into my file and comes back with the same answer - tough. She tells me she found something on my credit report that was late. I challenge her on this because I monitor my reports and I have a 700 score. I ask her what specifically she sees - she won't tell me. She then asks me what credit report I am looking at - I don't tell her, but ask her which one she is looking. Again she won't respond - kinda odd, particularly since my main bank just saw fit to give me a $15k unsecured line of credit - don't you think?\n\nI mean seriously - these guys take zillions of $$s out of the economy so they can line their pockets with fat bonuses, extra homes and country club memberships.  And they cant be made available to anyone? \n\nI point out that this kind of extortion is exactly what's put them in hot water with congress and the American public and how I really didn't understand the timing of their decision to reduce my credit limit. Whatever motivated them COULD NOT have happened during the month they lowered my scores, because I subscribe to the credit monitoring services.\nWAKE UP EVERYONE!!! - THEY ARE STEALING FROM US ALL AND, AS THEY SAY, LAUGHING ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK!!\nPlease don't fall into the vicious trap I did. They don't treat rich people this way."
0,"I stopped by the Chicken Box to grab lunch today.  I hadn't been there for a long time, and I was really excited about getting some of their fried chicken, mac & cheese, and collard greens.  \nWhen I pulled into the parking lot I noticed a big sign hanging down from the roof proclaiming that the original owners were back and it was under new management.  \n\nI hate to say it, but the original owners have really messed up a good thing.  \n\nWhen I went inside the huge menu board that listed all the amazing soul food side dishes were gone.  \n\nI guess the new management is trying to just rip off Price's by having the only side dish be mediocre coleslaw and bad tater tots.  \n\nThe real shame is that they obviously changed the fried chicken recipe.  \n\nDoes anyone know where the old managers went?  I need more of there home cooking.  This new chicken box cafe is terrible."
0,"This is no longer The Chicken Box Cafe.  Old owners or new owners, it wasn't very good. The fried chicken wasn't crispy or seasoned like before. They were out of Mac and Cheese!!!

0,"Took Amtrak from Durham to Charlotte to see the Panther/Saints game. On the return trip we were stopped by a broken down N&S freight train on the single track around High Point. We didn't move for an hour and a half. Several weeks later I took the train to see the Panthers/49ers play.  The return trip was delayed because earlier in the day the train had run over two people in Durham and Greensboro. We were supposed to leave Charlotte at 5:15. By 6:30 they couldn't tell us any status about when the train would arrive. \""Could be 8. Could be 9. It might never show up.\"" I had to spend the night in Charlotte and catch the next morning's train. On the return we were 15 mins outside of Durham when the train came to a halt. There was a sensor issue that had to be investigated. Never, ever will I use Amtrak."

0,"This Caterer entirely ruined my sisters wedding yesterday.  For a small 50 person wedding, the cost was ridiculous and even though they paid their bill in FULL months before the wedding, the caterer was still asking for money up until the day of the event.  The Basic Cake clause in the contract was not explained well.  The catering staff kept asking the family all night for a schedule of things even though it had been provided to them by the bride weeks earlier.  They even cut the cake before the bridal couple cut the cake and were serving it during the toast!  \n\nThe food was cold, the displays were well done although very sparse, there was no butter provided for the rolls, salt and pepper was not provided and when asked for, was told that having salt and pepper available would be an insult to the chef.\n\nThe staff was supposed to be at the hall at 2:30 PM and didn't show up until after the guests started arriving at 3:45 for a 4 PM wedding.\n\nShameful, shameful.  I will never use this caterer again nor will I recommend it to any of my clients or businesses I do business with."
0,"I wish I could give a minus 5.  This was the most unorganized set up I've seen in a while.  We had to stop here on the way back from Mexico.  It took so long to get through Immigration and Customs, I swear the employees were on some kind of slow motion drugs.  We were about to miss our flight- in fact someone had to call the gate to ask them to wait for us.  When we saw the mile long line for security, we panicked.  I thought if I asked the security man very nicely if we could go to the head, since the plane was waiting, perhaps he would help us.  WRONG!!!  He was the rudest, most ignorant employee I encountered in the entire airport.   We ran our asses off and got to our gate just as they were closing the doors.  Luckily they let us board.  From now on it's non-stop for us!!!"

0,"As a frequent flyer, I avoid this airport.  It seems that a preponderance of the time that I have the unavoidable misfortune of connecting through Charlotte Douglas something invariably goes wrong.  On a recent international flight, our arrival at the gate was delayed and our luggage retrieval was further delayed by 45 minutes due to a lack of ground crew and baggage handlers.  Typical mishaps for a poorly managed airport.  Please do yourself a favor and avoid this airport."
0,"I'm not sure which is the worse nightmare. Living in Charlotte [ which unfortunately I did, for 8 tortuous months ]  or flying out of this dump of an airport. \n\nBathrooms are filthy, and always stink [ regardless of day, hour, season ] You can always guarantee rude employees, especially ones from US Airways who feel they are doing you a favor. I had a roach crawl out of my pizza box from pizza hut back in 1997. Restaurants suck the big one, all corporately herded chains. [ Of course if you live in this dump of a city, you're used to this ]  Always a packed airport at any given hour of the day, never any room to move.\n\nParking would be the worst, if you live in the Corporate Herd Hole. The City of Charlotte forces you to use there lots. There aren't any private lots? No! Their isn't! YOU READY? You have 2 options! You can fight all the other ass taking corporate employees who live in Charlotte and work for banks or corporations for parking spots or  you can go to the \""valet parking\"" lot at an additional rape price.\n\nI have a V for vendetta against Charlotte and this shithole of an aiport."

They're also unnecessary--there are plenty of airports that don't have creepy attendants and which have pristine restrooms.  The last thing I want in a public bathroom is some overly enthusiastic dude getting all up in my grill wishing me a wonderful day and trying to push paper towels into my hand.  The obnoxious obviousness for tips is annoying as well.  Why should I help subsidize the salary of an airport employee just because I took a whiz?  Get rid of these dookie denizens so people can do their business in peace and not get hit up for cash."

0,"We are in the midst of a very stressful transition, moving across the country from Charleston, SC to Portland, OR, in order to access better educational and therapeutic resources for our daughter Camille, who has Cerebral Palsy. \n\nOne US Airways Charlotte gate agents, Connie Owens, took it upon herself this morning to make our travel even more difficult, stressful, and inconvenient. I do not have sufficient words to express my absolute disgust and disappointment with Ms Owens' lack of compassion, flexibility and courtesy.  \n\nWe have flown with our daughter many times in the past eight years, usually taking US Airways because your crews have been unfailingly helpful, sympathetic and courteous.  Until now.  \n\nCamille is now twelve years old, nearly 100 pounds, and almost five feet tall.  She is non-ambulatory, non-verbal, has autistic-like sensitivities, and often will require one or more diaper changes on a long flight.  Consequently, we always sit as close to the back of the plane as possible, as she is much too large to change in the tiny bathroom, and past flight crews have been very accommodating in arranging to either block off the aisle, screen off the last row of seats, or allow us to use the floor of the galley when everything is locked down After service.  \n\nWe were explaining this to the flight crew and Ms Owens when she took it upon herself to insist that that absolutely could not be done, that we were only allowed to change Camille in the bathroom, which is physically impossible, and to aggressively verbally berate my wife Christina over wanting to make some arrangement so that we could get to our destination with a minimum of discomfort and inconvenience to ourselves and our fellow passengers.  \n\nHer aggression set off our daughter into a loud and prolonged screaming fit.  Rather than wait for the meltdown to pass, or to back off and give us a chance to calm our daughter, Ms Owens immediately contacted security to have us removed from the plane, which was unnecessary, humiliating, and a tremendous inconvenience.  \n\nThe security manager, Mike, was extremely kind, courteous and helpful as he assisted us from the plane, and consequently rebooked our flights for tomorrow, and set us up at a hotel near the airport. Nonetheless, this has made a difficult and stressful trip even more so, and has caused us to have to scramble to rearrange things at our point of arrival.  We are also stuck in a hotel without most of our luggage and some of our prescriptions. This has been, overall, a horrible experience, and certainly will make us think twice before flying US Airways or its affiliates again.  In addition, I cannot imagine that Ms Owens' actions were in any way acceptible per the ADA.  \n\nI attempted to call to make and resolve this complaint, but the agent and supervisor I spoke with insisted that it could only be addressed through a web form, promising contact in one to three business days, which I find to be completely unsatisfactory. \n\nOn the positive side, Yvonne J, another gate agent, was tremendously helpful and compassionate.  We also received assistance from an airport maintenance man, whose name I did not catch, in replacing a bolt on the wheelchair that broke as we were bringing it up the gangway.  \n\nI would appreciate a response as soon as possible, which should include a plan of action for training your personnel to deal with the needs of disabled passengers."
0,"Half hour layover turned into an hour plus. Here's why: out of 2 gates 3 flights are being called: fort Lauderdale, Albany, Philly. \nSo first they called first class of each flight. Except all of them were yelling over each other. Plus people literally elbowing and smacking each other with cranky kids. Etc. \n\nHowever, punch line : not airport fault, the winner is US Airways who just announced that they have stopped boarding the FLL flight as their is an armrest on a seat that needs to be fixed. \n\nSo help me god, I don't care. I'll sit in that chair. \n\nEither way someone just trampled over me and kicked my broiling new cup of caramel macchiato which is leaving a huge stain on the carpet. \n\nCall me crazy... I don't feel bad. \n\nWhat has your airline and airport done for YOU lately????????"

They lie to you and say that your flight will leave \""one hour later than expected\"". This lie renews every hour after the first estimate is found to be a lie.\n\nThe worst was in the winter of 2011 where I was kept at the airport for 3 days straight days because the airport neglected to buy de-icing agent - for 3 days. I eventually left by taking a train."

0,"Dear Airport:  I've never been inside you, but let me tell you how much you suck on the outside. You suck a lot. Is this entire place under construction??? Oh, yes... yes, it is. Did a nuclear bomb take out short term parking? The roads leading in and up to the terminal are a confusing, cone-zone maze and are also under construction. The construction appears to be under construction. Hate you."
0,"Um, this airport sucks, okay? Avoid at all costs. \nI flew through here two times last week. Both coming and going we experienced hour-long runway delays. Seriously. When landing, we had to chill out someplace random b/c another plane was at our gate unexpectedly. And then there was no skybridge. And then we had to circle around a few times because the airport gods grew tired of us sitting and waiting. Then, both times we took off (heading to and from Tally), we had to wait, stacked up on the runway, for 45 - 60 minutes. Case in point, the pilot actually told us excitedly once we were NINTH for departure. Unless CLT is your home, fly through ATL."

0,Worst airport ever.. Flight to Jacksonville was schedule for 9:19am.. I'm currently still sitting at the airport nearly 2 hours later. The lady on the overhead has been telling the passengers we will leave in 15-20 minutes. At this point I'm tired of hearing that. Now I know if there was something wrong with the plane then it's understandable but no we have yet to board the aircraft due to the 1st officer not being here on time.. Now if you know there's a flight schedule why wouldn't you make sure the person is her or even better have a back up plan.. Ridiculous planning if you ask me!! All I'm saying is SFO left on time and arrived in Charlotte early.. Now that's a good job well done.. As for my first time in Charlotte.. No never again.. I'll just pay extra for a direct flight
0,"I arrived at Charlotte 15 minutes before my plane was supposed to leave. I had to transfer from terminal B to terminal E. When I asked for them to hold my flight, the gate agent said that they know we're coming and not to worry. We ran to the gate and there was no one there and no plane. When they came back they said that 15 minutes ago they gave our seats to standby passengers and that the PLANE LEFT 15 MINUTES EARLY! They told us that it is a transfer airport so they usually leave early. BS!  They told us that they only hold the plane if there at least 10 people missing. Luckily there was 1 more flight that night. Suck it U.S Airways"

Really? ...........Really?\n\nWTF!  Our Government and the TSA are so out of touch in this location it is just outrageous, period. How come the Charlotte Airport Authority doesn't intervene and explain to the TSA management that this has to improve? \n\nThis is why I absolutely HATE this airport, but I still love the City of Charlotte!\n\nBTW, The Tampa International Airport TSA do a great job, and are friendly and efficient!"
0,Came to this airport to connect to another flight. Had a 12 hour layover which is fine because I was made aware of this upon booking the flight. Went downstairs to baggage claim because the airline overhead compartments were full (again no big deal). Picked up luggage only to be told cannot go back upstairs where restaurants since we left out the main area of the airport!? I informed the agent that we have not eaten and ONLY came downstairs because that's we were advised to do. She informed us that there was a Starbucks and that we could eat there (totally not what I was looking forward to). \n\nBUT I can deal with that..although I was very upset at the moment. What I cannot deal with are MICE running past my feet upon working on my computer and eating my sandwich!! This is totally UNACCEPTABLE for an airport and I advise EVERYONE that comes to this airport to watch your bags..and don't put them on the floor!! This is the last time I will be flying into Charlotte airport if I can help it..and If I have to come here I will just rent a car and drive...smh\n\nDissatisfied customer ...
0,"First time in Charlotte and the VPOTUS delayed my flights by more than fifty minutes.  This time we encounter a bit of a jerk gate attendant from US Airways.  Really unprofessional in her handling of a traveler that happened to have missed her earlier calls to him.  Heck, he still had over thirty minutes before boarding and his seat was given away.  For that, not feeling the love here.  \n\nReeks of jet fuel/exhaust in the E Concourse too.  Close the doors much?"
0,"Avoid at all costs, especially if flying USAir. Customs was worse than JFK. THIS IS NOT the airport for international connecting flights. Completely understaffed for an excessively busy Sunday. Worst combination of southern efficiency and northern charm. Better to go through Miami."
0,This airport is having a terrible time with the parking solution right now. they need to get this fix quickly. apparently they are rebuilding new parking decks so in order to park you have to park at the lots across some street and get on a suttle in order to get  back to the airport. so terrible if you are not just picking up and dropping off your friends and family.
0,"Terrible congestion.  Poor planning.  Poor traffic flow.  Poor crowd control.  This airport is 20 years behind other airports of similar size and volume.  Be forewarned.  You will have a 20-40 minute wait to get to passenger drop off or pick up, pretty much anytime between 6am and 9pm.  Parking?  Be prepared to park a long way away from the main building and wait up to an hour for a shuttle to pick you up. You could probably walk it by then, twice.  And by then, the shuttle may be pretty full.  If you're disabled, good luck."
0,Us airways is incompetent and unfit to call themselves an airline!  True story emergency landing and stuck in the airport for 4 hours with no answers!!! No one seems to know what's going on?
0,"Nope not any better this time around. Still hectic, still tons of people. If you have a connecting flight out of CLT - put your running shoes on - because it's a long way from gate to gate and usually you'll have to rush to make your next flight."
0,If you can avoid checking your bags when flying into this airport - DO SO.  Worst baggage claim area I've ever experienced.  Over 45-minutes to get luggage.
0,"I guess if you fly USAirways, maybe this airport is good. Maybe it should be named USAirways Charlotte international.   If you fly out of concourse A, good luck."
0,"One word to describe this place- awful. Sure not as bad as Philly, but Charlotte at least gets second place! Trying to get across this airport is like a huge race! I've never seen so many people running around like madmen to get on connecting flights. When I was in the same situation, I ran like crazy with my wife and child to get from gate to gate. Finally when we got there, the woman who's name was I believe faseeka? Phasequa? Ghetto girl? Told us she had held the flight as long as possible; which was only about 5 minutes. The plane is still sitting near the gate clearly visible from the window. We pleaded with faseequa to let us on, but she literally too us the flight was closed and turned around so she wouldn't have to look at us. When we came back about 10/15 minutes later, the plane was STILL THERE! She then continued to type nonsense on her computer while I tried to talk to her. I asked her name, and then how I should spell it. She then refused to spell her name and got really snippy and utterly ignored me. In the end we missed a flight that was right there, sitting with the DOOR OPEN for 15 minute because faseequa refused to let us on. Screw this airport! We then had to wait 5 hours for another flight to an airport 2 hours from our house. Thanks you cold heartless woman. I understand your job is veeeerryyyy stressful, sorry to trouble you like that faseequa! (Sarcasm)"
0,Went on several websites to find a map that shows a baggage claim area location. There isn't.  Called several airlines they were unable to find anything. What's up with that.
0,"I have no idea how things are on the Departure side of Security.   But, for anyone picking up a passenger here, this is one of the worst airports I can imagine.  Other than a Starbucks (w/o seating) and a magazine shop, and a \""Cafe\"", there is nothing."
0,"Everything good in this airport is RUINED by the obnoxious level of loud music playing by terminal D7 at \""The Local Rustic Market\"". I was unable to talk on the phone or hear any announcements about my flight status over the music. I asked if they could turn it down and the manager suggested I walk down the hall, away from my gate in order to be able to hear any announcements from the gate. Stupid is not a good enough word to describe that suggestion."
0,Been in three airports on our trip to North Carolina. I know it's summer. What happen to the air conditioning. They've lied if its about being GREEN. It's about the other green!!!
0,"The most ridiculous airport for connections. \n\nNew union rules have imposed a ground shutdown if there is lightning within a mile if the airport. \n\nYou can be siting on the tarmac only a few feet from a gate for over half an hour and not able to get out. In the meantime your connecting flight can be boarding. \n\nOnce the shutdown is over your connecting flight is ready to go, you've lost all your connection time, they've bumped you off the flight and now you're on a flight 2-3 hours later. Even if your connecting plane is still at the gate they won't wait for you or let you on. \n\nHas stupidity reached a new all time high?"
0,"Concourse C..starting with the nasty B at Wolfgang Puck...you VOLUNTEERED for the job. Maybe ringing up pre packaged food is not for you. This is not the first time I have had the displeasure of you nasty attitude. I am sorry your life is so miserable,  but please refrain from taking it out on the people willing to give your company money. \nDerrick at the news stand right before gate C19...you see the huge line, there are 4 employees standing around talking to you. I ask if you know how to run a register you say no..tell one of the other girls to start ringing and you leave. Your foul mouthed employee then proceeds to complain about what a dick you are and tells me it's not her job to bag the $20 shirt I just purchased.  People of the Charlotte airport, there is a reason I avoid flying US Air. Your bad attitude and horrible service is part of the reason. I never receive such horrible service, over all at any other airport and I fly all the time."
0,"Women in baggage claim lied about where my bag was as they wouldn't even look it up in their computer. After burping Chinese food in my face and refusing to look in the computer I accepted what they were telling me only to arrive at my destination bag less. \n\nUnprofessional, lazy and making a bad name for the South."
0,"Avoid this airport. Had a connecting stop here on our way back from Mexico and hated every minute of it. Had to collect our bags and go thru security again was a huge pain in the rear. After that no real food in the entire E concourse. Creepy bathroom attendants handing out Listerine and mints. Over crowded tiny gates with no place to sit or charge a phone. Any review that says this place is great seriously has not been anywhere. CLE, PIT, ORD, LAS, LAX, PHL even ATL is better than this shack of an airport."
0,"We arrived an hour early for a domestic flight and security was so slow that I had to run to catch my flight.  Their excuse?  \""Some time are a little slower than others.\""\n\nAdvice to passengers:\nArrive AT LEAST an hour and a half early.\n\nAdvice to the airport:\nGet your act together."
0,"This is by far the worst airport ever. We have went to 3 different food place to eat and have had a bad experience at all of them. The first one took over  an hour tonget our drink order then came back and said oh you have 5 minutes to order I said ok I'll take this sandwich \""oh we don't have it or this or this \"" that was a larger portion of the menu so we said well I guess we are not eating here finished our drinks had to go ask for the check and meantime I saw our server dig in the trash for silverware and not wash his hands before grabbing food! The bk and taco place was also awful workers seemed extremely rude and bk took 15 min but the food was right there the whole time. Just don't eat here stay away avoid at all cost !"
0,"Slowwwwwwwwwww  - I do not normally rate fast food places - you get what you pay for,  My experience at this Charlotte BK was nothing I have ever seen\n\n1.  I ordered 2 combo meals - 25 MINUTES from order to food\n2.  The manager did nothing to help get orders\n3.  One of the cooks (sagging pants and all) was singing Usher songs  at the front counter instead of making food - \n4.  Processed chicken strips do not do well when the sit for 25 minutes - they tasted like s*it.\n5.  No thank you , sorry about the wait, here's a free _______ for the poor service  - \n\nI would have gone somewhere else - but I was like whats the point - the food has to come eventually \n\n\nSTAY AWAY !"
0,"We ordered breakfast here during a layover. My croissant was literally dripping cloudy looking water.  Since we plopped down almost 20 bucks, I tried forcing it down until I felt something odd in my mouth.,,  a hair that neither matched my hair's color or ethnicity.  This BK should be shut down!!!!"
0,"I asked if it had tomatoes. I said I was allergic to tomatoes. They said there are no tomatoes on that sandwich. Do I want tomatoes? I said no, please, no tomatoes. I get the sandwich, there are two tomatoes on there. So they put tomatoes on a sandwich that doesn't get tomatoes after we talked about how I can't have tomatoes. \n\nI'm hungry."
0,"Avoid this place in the airport. 20 minutes to wait for a standard order is not acceptable. I had to wolf down my food to make my flight when I should have had plenty of time. Epic fail BK, clean up your act."
0,"Had to argue with the cashier while ordering a kids meal. The menu clearly shows that with the kids meal you can choose apples slices instead of a toy. Instead of looking at the menu she asked another employee, who confirms what the menu shows. Instead of apologizing and making sure the change was made, she gave me a blank look and i had to make the request again. Too much to expect at a fast food joint."
0,"Horrible restaurant. They don't seem to care about customer service, and very often make errors on my order. I usually have to repeat my order at least twice. I know its fast food - but this place is bad."
0,"Wow.  I was the only one in line, and there were 5 people (all co-workers) sitting there chatting.  After I was ready to go at the register, it took another 3-4 minutes of waiting for them to finish chatting before I could get service.\n\nThere are way too many people that work here for the service.   At least the food was okay, although I have to say that it's not exactly \""fast food\"".  You might get better service at the Chilis Too in the same airport."
0,"The worst people I have seen in the business. I asked the hostess to substitute a veggie Patty in the 4 cheese burger and she her to make sure that there was no meat in it. She took like half an hour to check if they could even make it like that. I mean what the ****! And then when I get my Burger, there was no patty in it....! What the **** ! So, I go back to the hostess and I was like where is the patty...? She is like you said no meat. I was like yeah... That's why I asked you to sub a veggie patty. And her response was gold. She said that they consider ALL the patty to be meat. And the worst part is that they were all laughing at me for wanting a 4 cheese burger with veggie patty...!\n\nI didn't want to create a scene... But these people need to respect the customers... The stupid ungrateful bunch of illiterate jerks....!"
0,Sundays used to be all you can drink vodka for 10 dollar cover... After paying our cover they let us know that beginning this week vodka drinks are 2 dollars... Why would anyone come on Sunday if they're pouring 2 dollar glasses of cranberry juice?
0,Would give it 0 stars if I could. Getto place with workers that don't give a damn about customer service! Never will go here or recommend to anyone that they waste any money on this place!
0,SHIT HOLE!!!  Too bad 0 stars is not an option here.  The staff and management are rude and only want money.  Someone sprayed pepper spray and sent multiple patrons to the ER and the staff just sat there like they could care less.  Save yourself the trouble and just flush your money down the toilet!.  This place is so ghetto and trashy.  All the money they make from $30 admissions and it still looks the same as it did in 1974.  Disgrace to the gay community!!
0,"This place has everything to be a great local Italian place except one thing, good Italian food!  I had the spaghetti with Italian sausage. What I got didn't look like any plate of spaghetti I've ever seen. The sausage was piled on top the meat sauce in ground pile. Poor, poor presentation.  I tasted the pizza and the crust was undercooked and burnt on the edges. Obviously the oven was too hot. My advise, stop in have a drink enjoy the atmosphere then gotlot Olive Garden to eat."
0,"Food tasted less than average, kind of Chef Boyardeeish.  The owner complained how business is nothing what it used to be and snuffed at my Groupon and spoke under his breath and complained about people using plastic instead of the good ole days when everyone paid cash!  Go figure.  I won't be back again."
0,"World Famous? OMG...World Famous? \n\nI am a lifelong Charlottean and the Open Kitchen of my youth must be in a pod somewhere waiting instructions from the mothership. This place gives restaurants...no...anyplace with a kitchen, a bad name. Terrible greasy smelly cheesy food. Cinnamon or nutmeg or something in the sauce. flimsy plastic cups and paper plates, cold bread. And to top it off the woman at the register was very rude. \n\nCome back Mama K.....we need you."
0,"I grew up going to this place but will avoid it now. We went there Sunday after a Panthers game. The worst pizza I have had. I told the server. She just said, \""I'm sorry you feel that way.\"" The crust isn't made there; it's a cardboard-like bland crust that's brought in. I had 6 pieces of pepperoni on an entire large pizza. It was around $13.\n\nWhen I called to speak to John, the owner, he said people love the pizza and hung up. I called back and eventually he offered to refund my money. At least that was a good move.\n\nMy advice? Stay at home and fix a ChefBoyArdee pizza. It's about the same. I will give this one star because you can't give a zero. That's was my last visit to Open Kitchen! (Except to get my refund)"
0,"I am baffled that this place is still in business and has a packed parking lot at night. It's dying for Chef Ramsey to come in and do a turnaround on it. It's textbook \""We've lost the love of cooking\"" and now takes the easy way out and used canned everything. Even the \""world famous pies\"" are frozen perfectly round manufactured pizzas with congealed cheese in one gross layer and no flavor. It's like a mini-frisbee with a little cheap pizza sauce and gross elementary school cheese. I ate one of the 8 slices of the pizza and called it quits.\n\nThe lunch side salad came in a little bowl with iceberg lettuce and an INCH of Italian dressing. Yes, an inch. It was ridiculous.  The lasagna and spaghetti is very generic.  The only thing I can say anything positive about (besides the awesome kitschy interior is the seafood dish with bechamel sauce, but you can only get it once every 2 years for fear of heart attack because it's so rich.  \n\nI'm sounding hateful, not because I want them to go away, which I don't but because I want them to reinvigorate their menu to be authentic Italian (or heck, even Greek since they're greek!) I love the place, but it's not enough to get me to eat the food, so that says a lot. I wanted to be a regular, but I just can't stomach it. I might phone up Gordon to save them from themselves..."
0,"Service was good,  BUT THE FOOD IS TERRIBLE,  MADE ME VIOLENTLY ILL.  I had the '' World famous lasagna''  and as one who makes a mean lasagna,  was NOT impressed with its taste,  but fought thru it anyway,  thinking I was just being overly critical.  Salad was poor,  overall rating should be '' Shut down and make a kiddie playground inside ''  If could give it no stars,  I would..."
0,"Wow I haven't been here since I was knee high to a grasshopper and all I have to say is BLEH! Not impressed whatsoever.. I don't know what did it in for me the stale store bought bread, the plastic cup my tea came in, the soppy noodles in my chicken barcelona, (quite frankly I'm surprised that my entr\u00e9e didn't come out with a little paper plate and plastic fork), OR the fact that our waiter wanted us to pay the bill not even half way through our meal!  \n\nSigh. I'm glad we used Groupon.. I definitely would've dined and dashed hadn't it been for that.. \n\nI'm sorry (not really) but I would rather go to olive garden than go to this place ever again."
0,"I used a groupon and still felt like they should have paid me to ingest this greasy, canned, smelly, revolting garbage.  \n\nIt astounding that this dump is still open.  It's gotta be a nostalgia thing with people who have fond memories of this bastion of canned and frozen cuisine from their younger years.  The clientele appeared to be, uh, rather obes.  So maybe it's the massive portions of high carb/fat that keeps these heifers coming through the door to graze?  A BMI that high does not come without putting in some effort!\n\nThe \""meat\"" in my dish was some greasy lips and assholes.  I tried to get by the visual and get a forkful into my mouth.  Needless to say, this was a mistake.  \n\nAnd to finish up this Tour de Food Lion, the owner at checkout was a rude.  When my friend and I tried to split the bill with two credit cards he said \""Oh come on.  You are killing me!\"".  My response was \""Yeah, the feces on a plate that you call food is killing me!\"".  He did not appreciate that.  Not at all.  And I could not have given less of a shit!"
0,CUSTOMERS BEWARE.. THERE ARE THIEVES WORKING IN THIS STORE.  I live out of state and gave my credit card number to the sales manager at this store location. His name is Robbie ..After one week.. I had over 2k dollars of fraud charged on my credit card at North Carolina Gas stations.  This has been turned over for investigation.
0,"Been closed for months,was open less than 6 month enough said!\nWasn't very good at all...."
0,Worst service. The cashier was trying to make the mcflurry and knew it was running out of mix. Instead of just telling me we are low on mix she gave me half a cup! Never again.
0,"I would not eat there any more. I went there late night or lets say after 4am. The staff didn't know how to greet a customer the appropriate way and was dressed any kind of way. I seen a few staffs without there McShirts on. And i know McDonalds have uniforms. Then they messed up my order. And instead of making me a new one. I believe they swap out the bacon and put this dried up steak and dried up onions on the same egg, cheese and bagel. Because she said i would have to wait and then Bam! the sandwich was there. 15sec.  My other item bacon, egg, and cheese was also hard, dry and cold. After waiting in drive thru line at this time of morning, I was expecting 3 hot freshly made biscuits and bagel. Smh. terrible. They didnt even offer me anything for their mistake and wait. Looks like they were in there just playing with ppls food. My thing was, breakfast just started at 4am. It was 4:11am when i ordered. Why is the food hard and dry?\n\nI was so disgusted with the unprofessionalism, not caring employees, i didnt want to even look at them anymore and i didnt want to wait and make them cook it over because i was tired and hungry. I don't usually eat at Mcdonalds and you pretty much know what ur getting, but dam! That is just ridiculous. You had to see it with your own eyes.  \n\nAll i can say is the staff at this location needs to be trained much better including managers. There is no reason to run a business that way. I don't care what area its in."
0,"I like to think of myself as an intelligent person, who can express his thoughts well with words.  \n\nBut all that comes to mind about this joint is \""comically bad.\""  \n\nI went with people from my office to this location for lunch.  It took a while for a server to come to our table (the place empty- only one other table of patrons) and it took a while for our drinks to arrive.  \n\nWhat truly made this experience was how long it took for us to get the check.  Our server just walked out.  Like, just walked out.  \n\nOur drinks never got refilled, we never got a \""Hey folks, I'm heading out for a while,\"" nothing.  \n\nSo, we try to pay.  We go up to the counter, and say we want to pay.  The girl there just shrugs, yells back, \""COUNTER!\"" and walks off.  No one comes from the back.  Someone from our group flags down someone who had on a PH shirt to try to get her to ring us up.\n\nThis girl manages to get our ticket up, and asks for my ID to pay for a $5 pizza with my card.  If I stole a credit card, I would find better things to do with it than buy a small pepperoni from Pizza Hut.  \n\nThe girl tries to ring up the order with my card.  She has to swipe it a number of times.  Then, turns around and walks off.  No explanation.  A woman returns with her, who is giving me seriously dirty looks, and asks to run my card again, that it didn't take before.  \n\nI hand over my card, and think, I can't wait to get to Yelp."
0,"I would never review a McDonald's normally, but I have to review this one because its so disgusting. Every single time I go its dirty, every time. Tables, benches, whatever it is, dirty. The food is usually below average and the workers barely speak English. Go somewhere else (PLEASE!!) instead and skip this place."
0,"THE Worst McDonald's I have ever experienced. Believe me, I'm a vet & have been to them all around the world too! Find another; it's easy enough to do."

0,"No way would I ever go back. I was looking to trade and was offered 40% of what I paid. Gun was brand new. I then asked to see what they had in the price they offered me. Not much, even in the used section.  I told the guy that I was confused with the prices, because I was looking at used guns with new gun prices. He was very defensive and said they had overhead and it's has to be paid for somehow. What a joke. \n\nI've been to several other shops who are very friendly and have much better prices."
0,Very overpriced!!! save your money and go elsewhere. Not willing to deal!  Go to Eagle guns instead.

0,This place is closed last year.
0,"Ive stayed here about 6 times over the past 4-5 years.  This trip was 3 nights, and moving would have been such a hassle, but this was my last stay here ever.  We just toughed it out.   Management is either incompetent or intentionally running it into the ground, sucking every penny out of it.  Most of the staff seems discouraged.  The entire place is dirty and tired.  The elevator was broken (and had been for a month).  Hard to believe this is allowed to go on in when there's 3 floors of guest rooms.  I told the staff the stairwells were filthy, and the one I spoke to about it said she wont go in them.  Smart gal.  Our room on second floor had dirty walls, horrible lumpy pillows, black junk coming out of the sink faucet and a pathetic shower.  My bare feet got dirty just walking once across the room.  The security side door was broken open.  Oh, and they even charged a $1.00/day for the in room safe we didn't use. Really?  The best view of this place is in my rear view mirror.  Done."
0,"Room was very small, smelled dirty, bath tub drained extremely slow. I will never stay here again. Light fixtures were rusting and room is outdated. Don't expect any type of luxury here. You get what you pay for."
0,"Overall - do not ever stay here if you can avoid it.  I will be posting this review to Hotels.com as well to try and help other travelers.  Read on for details.\n\nI got put here by US Airways after my flight was cancelled due to 'aircraft maintenance' and after the attendant apologized for having no other choice but this Microtel, I thought 'How bad can it be?'  Well let me tell you.  As a pretty well traveled guy who takes a pride in being comfortable anywhere, no matter how run-down or low-maintenance, and has thoroughly enjoyed sleeping in dirt-floor mosquito-net bungalows in Laos - the only way to possibly be comfortable here is to down a bucket of beer and pass out cold.\n\nYou want to forget you are staying here.  BEFORE you stay here.\n\nYou want to check your bed for traces of bed bugs.\n\nYou stare in awe as two police officers remove an obviously cracked out prostitute from the ice-machine area.\n\nEven through your alcoholic haze you can tell it's not a good sign the receptionist is arguing with 4 cops at 2 in the morning.\n\nThe room looked, smelled, and flat out felt terrible to be in.  Holes in the sheets.  A 6-minute long airport shuttle that only leaves every hour.  It was a smoking room - and I don't smoke.\n\nNow you're not so surprised when the people who checked in before you checked out 15 minutes later.  And when you discretely ask them why, they inform you they work for Wyndham and this place is even below their standards.\n\nListen to me.  Just don't ever do it.  Please, save yourselves!\n\nThat's all I got.  You've been warned."
0,"My 4 friends and I were in Charlotte NC and our flight was cancelled which then made us miss our connecting flight back to LAX. They set us all up in a hotel not too far from the airport so that was great...until we read the yelp reviews that the place is stinky, not clean and had bed bugs. We figured we would try it out so we called for the shuttle to come to pick us up because we had no place to stay. We sat out in the cold for 40 min when we were told it would take 15 min by hotel staff that helped us. Cold and exhausted we went back into the airport to see if there was another option. Nope. Finally after another 15-20 minutes the shuttle came and we drove to the hotel. When we got to our rooms one wreaked of smoke and had multiple hair strands (that weren't ours) on the made up beds. We walked into the other room which smelled better but had a huge beetle crawling on the wall, spider in the bed, crumbs on the night stand, hairs and dirt in the shower, and hairs and urine on the toilet. We were 5 girls that are stuck in a disgusting hotel at 12 AM, on the opposite coast. All the other hotels either full or ridiculously expensive and United would not get back to us. I will never be flying with them again.\n\n\nOh and to top it off when we got back to California we found another person last year that we know had the same thing happen to her except she slept in the bed, got bed bugs on her face and ended up going to the emergency room because of the reaction. I wish I could give them zero stars. This place is DISGUSTING. Don't ever stay there."
0,"This place is the nastiest hotel that I have ever encountered! Stuck because our flight was cancelled and all other hotels near the airport were full or really overpriced, we stayed here. The lobby smelled like cat urine that I realized wasn't quite so bad after stepping into the elevator that reeked of sour milk. The room brought more cat urine scent. Two bugs greeted me as I entered my room. I immediately checked the rest of the room....no bugs yet. I will not be using the shower in the morning. Tapping together my ruby slippers....there's no place like home!"
0,"Terrible! I'm just now getting over this horrible stomach bug caused by his place. I ended up paying $10.92 for a salad, water, and a small tiramisu. Needless to say, that price is ridiculous! You should never have to pay that much at lunch time for that little amount of food. \n\nSpeaking of the food, in the salad, there was an egg and so I out it on a napkin because I don't like eggs. The waitress came by and asked how it was and I told her that I didn't like the egg. Instead of taking it or saying \""hey sorry about that\"" or something to the effect, she just walked off. \n\nThe tiramisu was awful, it tasted like someone tried to make banana pudding and failed. If you like tiramisu like I do, go to Olive Garden or SAMs club around Christmas. You will not be disappointed like you will here. \n\nNeedless to say, I'm never going back."
0,"Just say no. \n\nIt's smoky, it's country, it's worse than Georgetown, WDC, in terms of diversity (I mean I'm used to being the Token Black Chick, but seriously, I shouldn't be the only dot of color in the place). \n\nJust say no."
0,"we are familiar with Popey's (West coast version of this restaurant) so we thought, great! Landed late at the airport, let's go get some of their famous Dirty Rice, Fried chicken and fixings.  When we finally reached the order box at the drive through order station, the young lady's voice kept cutting in and out of the speaker.  We thought :\""well there must be something wrong with the microphone or their speaker box and continued on to pay. As we reached the payment window a man was at the window asking for $7 for the supreme meal, we said, \""no, we ordered the 12pc chicken with dirty rice, you know your supreme package with all the fixings.  He walks away waves his hand and yells at someone to come take the order right, this young african american comes up, asks why we dont want the supreme meal box and continually shuts the service window on us as we are trying to tell her we ordered the family meal. She turns around slams the window shut again and throws her hands up and walks off with this attitude!  Never comes back or to tell us what the price of the meal is going to be...she just abandoned us at the pick up window!  We have never been to this side of the state before....is this how you all treat your customers? No wonder Disney World is making a killing in this side of the woods!  There's got to be better employees than this...\n\nSuffice it to say we will NEVER eat at your restaurants in this area if your employees are this horrible to their customers.  We will not frequent any of your businesses here because of your poor training methods."
0,"First time , last time. stopped  by the drive thru for some quick food.  Someone in the family ordered a chicken wrap and that item made it a 20 minute wait.  No big deal, we are back home in Florida and Bojangles in non-existent here."
0,"Let's face it- it's a Wendy's.  You know what the menu is, and what to expect.  Really, all you can review is the service, which is pretty bad here.  \n\nMy order has been consistently wrong here.  When I get a salad, or a sandwich with lettuce, the lettuce is not fresh.  The service is rather poor.  Specifically, it takes noticeably longer to get food at this location, and often, the staff aren't making sure they are making food to order.  \n\nAdditionally (and this may seem like a strange note) the line rails leading up to order in the restaurant are not set like every other Wendy's.  It doesn't use the space well, and it's not clear where to stand. \n\nMy office very close to this location, yet I go out of my way to the Wendy's at 2801 Boyer Street instead.  They have much better service."
0,"This is the worst Wendy's I've been too !!!\nThe food comes out nasty looking, smashed, looks like it's been sitting for a while.....fries are either cold or way over salted!!!\ncashiers are to busy flirting with the boys that come in.\nSeems management doesn't care either.....\nRestrooms are always dirty at every visit I've been there.\nLast time I went.......about Sept of 2010, never going back."
0,"Ok, normally I would not review a fast food restaurant. Because lets face it most of us have the same experience every time we go to a fast food place. I feel obligated here though because it was one of the worst experiences I have had at any establishment. \n\nI pull into the parking lot and the line was quite long, so I decide to park and order inside and get it to go. I give the homeless guy outside a dollar and make my way inside, this is normal on this side of town. When I enter I see there is a long line inside as well. Note to anyone, do not let hungry control you it was my mistake on this day. \n\nThere was ONE person working the front of Wendys, not only was she taking peoples orders. She was also bagging the food, frying the fries and she was most likely making the burgers as well. I stood inline for probably 15 minutes, to get Wendys. When I should have left and just went to Cook Out down the street or even Pinky's. At least at Pinky's you have food in front of you in under 15 minutes. \n\nI took my burger home, I was polite to the girl working because I truly felt bad for her. I get home and open my food. I wish I was surprised but it was ice cold. The bun was firm like it was quite old. The cheese was hardly melted. So not only did I wait 15 minutes but I also got horrible fast food. Oxymoron I know but COME ON!"
0,"Having grown up in North Carolina, I've had lots of Barbecue (and I also smoke my own).  I feel I can adequately judge the quality of BBQ.  This particular establishment was unique in that it's right off the side of a highway and has drive-in microphones and ordering stations straight out of the 50's.  I did feel a little uneasy in the parking lot as it was in a shady part of town, but not a big deal.  I ordered the 1/4 Barbecue chicken meal and substituted potato salad for the slaw and onion rings for the fries.  In addition I ordered a \""Minced\"" barbecue sandwich, which is the classic barbecue that people would think of when talking about North Carolina style BBQ.   \n\nFirst let me say that FoodNetwork came to this establishment for the unique nature of the 50's style drive-in and for the unique way that the pieces of barbecue chicken are prepared.  They are deep fried and then dunked in barbecue sauce.  I will say that it is unique; however as the above would suggest, it is quite greasy.  It was \""okay\"" but I wouldn't say it is anything to specifically come here for.  \n\nAs for the barbecue, it is also \""okay;\"" I can safely say that the meat is not smoked (there is no smoke rising from the kitchen, so I don't see how that could happen).  In addition, the meat itself lacked the distinctive smoky flavor characteristic of good, slow cooked North Carolina barbecue.  The sandwich overall was ever so slightly more typical of NC BBQ than what I received from Mac's (which was very overcooked and completely lacked flavor), but unfortunately I would never recommend the restaurant for NC barbecue or otherwise."
0,"The food here used to be good, but like the side of town its on, it has gone down hill. I would not feel comfortable eating here at night without my friend Smith & Wesson with me.\nIts an old style 50's drive in where you order at your car and car hops bring the food. The last time I ate here the BBQ was greasy and had no smokey flavor. What really turned me off about the place was the car hop. I took my Mom for lunch one day. The bill was $12. I gave the car hop $15 and told him to keep the change. He looked at me in disgust and just turned around and walked away with out so much as a thank you or anything.  I gave him a 25% tip. What did he want 50%?\nThats okay, because Bar-B-Q King will never see me again! I'll spend my hard earned money where the food and service are better."
0,The food was greasy. BBQ sauce wasn't good at all. I went to try out their restaurant because the food looked good on triple Ds. Turned out the food wasn't worth the drive
0,"You get 1 star instead of two because the dude that brought us our food to our car, DEMANDED his tip.  DUDE - HERE'S A TIP - DON'T ASK FOR A TIP.\n\nCASH ONLY.\n\nI wanted to come to this place because it was on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives and fried chicken and bbq sauce.  Need I say more?\n\nWell, would I go back the next time I'm in town.  No thanks, I'll be making my way over to South 21 or Price's Chicken Coop.\n\nThe sauce was too vinegary for my taste. The chicken was somewhat moist, but I did feel that it might have been sitting around.  Everyone else in my party said the same thing.  The fries were definitely old and sitting around.  \n\nand well, the guy demanding a tip put a bad taste in my mouth."
0,"Not sure if this is the right listing for AT&T residential service but their internet via the new U-verse system isn't any faster, as a matter of fact it's significantly slower, than Time Warner's DSL.  The free DVR was nice but their promise of one bill for everything was a lie and I switched out as soon as I could.  Never again AT&T!  Not even for an iPhone!"
0,"AT&T UVerse has the WORST customer service..that is IF you can figure out how to communicate with anyone.   Their website is horrible, and after hours, forget about trying to talk to anyone about any issues about dropped programming, missing shows, recording issues..they really do NOT care about their customers."
0,"Ditto the other ratings for UVerse customer service, at least once you get past the fabulous sales people. My install was scheduled for between 9-11 am on a Saturday, dude called at 2:30 to say he was the \""outside guy\"" and was on his way. Was indignant when I asked about the earlier time frame (actually I laughed when I answered the phone and found out who he was....3.5 hrs late!), but I let him come and do at least the outside work. Called the number on my scheduled appt email at 3:30, got a woman who knew nothing about my issues, tried to transfer me to dispatch, transfer failed. She called me back, I asked for a supervisor and was on hold for 15 minutes. She called back again, tried to transfer me to somebody else, said there was a \""problem\"" with my order, but she couldn't tell me what it was. After another 20 minutes on hold, I hung up. She called back once more, told me she would call me as soon as the department was available - never heard back. Unbelievable! Not thrilled with Time Warner or most of their contracted install/repair folks, but at least when they are going to be late or have to reschedule, they call! DON'T DO IT!"
0,"So frustrated with AT&T's horrible service! AT&T was so bad, they credited my account (which sounded good, but due to horrible communication, they shut off my services and issued collection calls over the service amounts THEY offered to credit!) and convinced me to switch to uverse which is just as bad! Internet service is non reliable and there seem to be no competent customer service staff to help sort thru the issues. I feel AT&T has gotten so big that they no longer know how to service people.  GO ANYWHERE BUT AT&T!!"

0,"I went there for an annual eye exam with Dr. Atlas and experienced some of the worst customer service I've ever seen at a doctors office. The receptionist who checked me in did not know how to properly do it, and had to seek help from 3 other receptionists. If someone is hired for a job they should be properly trained in it before performing the job itself. The communication between the doctors office and the contacts department was nonexistent. The nurse at the office told me it would be fine to not dilate my eyes, and when I was sent to the contact department they said I needed to be dilated and sent back to the office for another part of the exam. This was after over an hour had passed. I went back to the other waiting room to learn that they did not request for me to come back or be dilated. Although the original nurse from the office gave me the reversal drops for the dilation, their communication issues need to be addressed. \nNeedless to say, today they lost 3 patients including myself and my family. Get it together."
0,"I got my hair cut here about a month ago. During the shampooing my scalp began to feel a little tingly but no biggie. By the time I sat in the stylist's chair though it felt as if my scalp was on fire. My ears were bright red and anywhere else that the wet hair had touched my face turned the skin bright red. Clearly I was having a bad reaction to their Aveda-only products.  \n\nThe stylist got very concerned and, appropriately, brought over the salon manager. The clearly unconcerned heard-it-before manager said that she, too, had a bad reaction to their products as did some other customers and that I \""might want to take a Benadryl\"" when I got home.  End of story! Not \""how can we make it better for you?\"" Not \""Oh I am so sorry this happened!\"" Take a Benedryl. That and they charged me full price for my miserable experience - maybe they felt that they had to recoup the cost of rinsing my head again?\n\nAny service professional that doesn't understand the importance of customer service will not get my money again."
0,I used to like this Mcdonald's location. But recently getting really disgusting. A lot of flies are flying around. Their floor is sticky. Tables and chairs are always nasty. It's really turned me off. I didn't get anything there!
0,This is a five star McDonalds so to speak. There's a baby grand player piano and an upstairs with tv. However the service and food quality are standard run of the mill McDs. I'm writing this from the upstairs after buying my daughter a happy meal. Her fries are cold as are the nuggets. The sprite is all soda no syrup. I got a small choco shake which was barely mixed. I think it's actually vanilla. Not fatal errors but either they're short handed or they just don't take pride in their job. Hope this is just a fluke.
0,The restaurant is clean but that is the nicest thing I can say about it.  The food was horrible both times I ate there in the past two weeks!  I talked to the manager after the first time who acted concerned but less than a week later the food was still horrible!!!!  Fries were cooked in old nasty grease( taste like everything but fries) and the burger was not done or hot!!!!!!!!!!!!
0,"New, clean but horrible service. Waited 20 minutes for two breakfast sandwiches."
0,"Sorry, the food was just horrible.  Ribs bad, penne pasta really bad, kids portions entirely to small and bad.  Veggie burger was pretty good.  All that bad and overpaid to boot.  The baked creamy corn side may have been the worst thing to ever touch my lips!"
0,"Went to Harper's yesterday to eat, but as soon as I saw the B rating, we left."
0,"Went to Harper's this past Tuesday, it had been at least 6 months or more since I had  had the Betty's Pimento cheeseburger. Sat in the bar area with one of the new interactive tables, that was so cool! Seems like the menu is much smaller than is used to be but I did finally find my beloved burger and ordered it with fries. I told the waitress to please make sure the fries were hot because the last time I was there they had been cold and I really wanted to enjoy this visit. When I received the burger it looked different, smaller and somehow sadder. I could actually fit this burger into my mouth! That used to be impossible because it was huge and I would have to eat it with a knife and fork. The flavor was bland and instead of the cheese running down my fingers I could barely taste it and the meat was just bland. I was so sad.\n\nSo in short the prices have gone up and the quality has gone down. I guess I will have to find a new fav burger joint.Booooooo!"
0,"This is a Charlotte Staple. Their menu is timeless as is their history in the South park area.  Yes but try telling that to the hostess who greets you by chewing gum and texting on her phone.   Yeah, I get it, sometimes you just got to get your tweet on, I agree, OMG LOL, I can't believe this guy who just came in here to get his to go order, #LMFAO.   Now don't be discouraged to dine in and sit in the bar area, where if you truly want to feel disconnected from your date, then the touch screen monitors are perfect, for you or the hostess.  After all who sits and talks with each other at dinner any more? The food is on par with an Americana type mid level restaurant, however the service leaves a bit to be desired.  When my salad came with a dried up crusted chicken breast on it and no dressing, I called to speak to a manager, but they were busy. Apparently a Tuesday night is busy for the manager (not the hostess).  The veggie burger tastes like cardboard, although the bun gives it a sort of layered cardboard effect which is not bad, if you're washing it down with tequila.  The filet even if ordered med. rare, comes out med. edible, and asking the wait staff for a refill is like asking the DMV for an estimated wait time; you're probably not going to get what you're looking for.   This is particularly sad because I used to love this restaurant, but even with prepubescent couples or online match dates who sit in the bar area to have the touch screen monitors mediate their awkward conversations,  it's still probably not the right fit.   The ribs are good, but the sides aren't.  If I was going to take anybody here, it would have to be my next door neighbor who lets their dog crap all over my lawn and never picks it up, or my grandfather who doesn't have any taste buds left and isn't bothered by slow service, because it takes him two hours to finish a bowl of soup anyway.  I would call ahead to make sure they're not busy, and definitely not on a Tuesday."
0,"Used to be our staple, but each time I go back their food gets more and more greasy. Who in the world is their new chef???. And their garlic dressing is disgusting."
0,I had the worst service at Harpers tonight. Service was lousy and indicative of how the service and food selections continue to slip.  I dine here frequently and tonight was a real DISAPPOINTMENT!
0,"Was there with an international group of colleagues recently.  I was very unimpressed. Humus dip that had far too much cumin in it. Soggy chips with a good steak. A double espresso that smelled and tasted more like the last bit of coffee that had been sitting in the thermos all day (which it probably was). Don't go there, there are lots of good alternatives in the area."
0,"Came here for brunch one day, we were so excited to start off with a carafe of mimosas. Then, the excitement slowly disappeared as we waited on someone to come to our table and greet us...and we waited...and we waited. And nothing :(. When we left we told the hostess that no one ever came to greet us and she just shrugged. Unfortunate because we wanted to mix-up brunch! Looks like we will stick with Flying Biscuit! Can't go wrong there."
0,"So Bank of america website is totally broken. That is not the worst problem. If you thinking openning an account -- run while you can and save your soul. I have explained to the customer service 50 times yes, 50 times over the last 5 years that website sw is broken. But they have the intelligence of a goat and when you explain to them the website is broken it is like explaining theory of relativity to a goat. I will give you few examples and it has been like this for  years. If you ask the sw to give you chart of your balance for last 12 month in June, it will stop in April. Today is June. In a different part if you ask for 12 mo of transactions it will give you few weeks and then dies. There was actually a time when it computed the total of my 2 savings and checkings account and came up with a WRONG number. I went to the local branch and the manager added the numbers using hand calculater and the number was different from what the website reported. So basically these people are stupid all the way to the CEO Moynihan (and including). He delegates his work the ppl in the executive office, and those ppl are just as stupid as customer service. Today I spent lovely time with a woman with the intelligence of a goat in the executive office her name is Charlotte Gimmel. She is so proud to work at the executive office telling she will solve the problem. So I asked her where did she get her computer degree from -- too stupid. But the stupid woman refuses me access to an IT person how their sw is f-----d up. So again, if you did not yet open your account at the hell of a bank run and save your soul. They do trully have infinite amount of stupid people. I have spoken to at least 50 and the low intelligence trash do not have the intelligence to read and understand what I already told them 50 times. They must actively hire only stupid people bc I have not found one who is smart from the CEO Brian T. Moynihan to the customer service. Brian, if reading this, get a job in food industry. That would fit your level of competence."
0,HORRIBLE.  I ordered a piece of furniture in September that was supposed to take six weeks to deliver.  It is Christmas and I still don't have it.  They don't answer phone calls or emails in a timely fashion  or at all.  I can't cancel or they will charge me $300 restocking fee and delivery.  What a joke.  Thanksgiving and Christmas ruined by these jerks because I have no seating.  NEVER AGAIN
0,"We've been here 2.5 years.  At first, everything was great.  Then a few staffing changes, and things started going downhill.  Then the property was purchased by Fairfield.  Things went from okay to a little worse to absolutely horrible. Since the property was bought maybe 6 months ago, the whole place has been in a STEEP decline. The buildings are filthy, and the grounds are littered with trash and pet waste.  It's actually become embarrassing to live here, to the point where we don't invite people over any more.  The apartments are not worth half what they charge for rent, in fact, we're buying a brand-new, custom-built home in a much nicer area, and our monthly payment will be about the same as what we pay for this s***hole.  Do yourself a favor and stay away."
0,"Yeah this place is horrible. I've been here for just under 2 years and I wish I was able to have moved out before I renewed my lease. The previous staff was alright. At least they were decent to talk to and understanding about day to day happenings. the new management team in the office now are cunts and have no sense of urgency or how to run a business. Because the rent payment process is for the most part automated, there is no need for them to be there other than to give tours and sign people up. With that being said, the model and the common area are FAR more upgraded and modern than the apartments them selves. The apts have 30+ year old appliances and we were told, well if they work then they are working by design and we can't replace them. But did I mention that they raised the rent after the 1st year? for what.. no property improvements have been made. The same low quality of people live in the place making what the previous person said to be entirely true. Waste and pet waste all over. Stupid parents let their small children play in the street so driving through the blind curves can almost be an accident waiting to happen. \n\nThe pool is never clean. the hot tub doesn't work. You can see the grossness in the water floating on top. There are constant issues with the apartment and complex as far as maintenance issues go. The resolutions are half assed and often repeated because a more solid solution is not sought out. The place is crawling with bugs, my payments to have that maintained is probably spent else where. The walls and ceilings are crap and look crap with the layers of paint over the problem areas. Band-aid approach to fixing things. Every month it is a new issue. They do not send out notices when complex wide issues/fixes will be happening. It really just is a crap place to live. Better options for 900+ a month and crappy service."
0,"My friend leased an apartment at this prison facility in the winter of 2010. Immediately upon moving in he noticed a leak in the bedroom that caused the room to flood every time it rained. It was apparent that the leak had been there for quite some time and that they had leased the apartment knowing about the issue. Requests to be moved to another apartment, be let out of the lease or have the issue repaired have been met with disdain or dismissed by the property manager. He continues to say the repairs have been sent out for bid. TEN MONTHS LATER the bedroom is still flooding every time it rains. Furniture and box springs have been damaged or destroyed including a shelf my friend's grandfather made that can never be replaced. The manager is unwilling to even take money off the rent to compensate for missed time from work and damages. Several days per month my friend is unable to use his apartment and/or bedroom due to flooding, loud fans and dehumidifiers running, etc. There is also MOLD in the kitchen resulting, I am sure, from the constant dampness in the apartment. The entire place smells musty and clothes have to be stored in plastic containers to keep them from getting wet and/or smelling like the damp carpet.  I firmly believe my friend's health is suffering possible long term effects. I know his mental state and financial situation have been compromised as well."
0,"This place is very close to my work, and I've gone three times as part of a group. The first two times, service was slow but not unbearably so. The food was decent, and the spicy mayo dip was really good.\n\nToday was my third visit. Halfway through my taco salad, I felt a clump of hair in my mouth. I fished it out, and although I really wanted to believe it had just fallen off my sleeve or shoulder, the clump looked nothing like my hair (blond) or my companion's (red).\n\nWe calmly asked for the manager and explained the situation. He picked up the glob of hair off the napkin and told us that it couldn't be the restaurant's fault because none of the employees have dark-brown hair. (Every single one that I saw did.)\n\nThen he walked away, said something to the server that sounded like \""wants a free meal.\"" They brought me a bill for $3 for my drink and brought my companion her full bill.\n\nGross as it was, I understand that mistakes happen. But when he implied that I was lying -- that pissed me off. If something similar had happened in my restaurant, I would have fallen all over myself trying to make it right, not insulted the customer.\n\nTotal lack of class and decency. We will never go again."

0,"I went to this practice after experiencing moderate to severe pain in my right ankle. When I made the appointment I told the person booking the appointment that it was related to my ankle (so they would hopefully assign me to a physician that was versed in that area).  When I went for my appointment, however, I was told by the doctor who saw me that she was not an ankle specialist, and could I come back later that same day to see someone who was.  As inconvenient as it was to do that (having to take time off work, twice in the same day), I went back. This new doctor, the \""ankle specialist\"" examined me and basically said he wasn't  \""exactly sure\"" what was wrong, could be one of any number of things, but he shot my ankle with cortisone in an effort to alleviate the pain. That relief lasted for two days, at which time I went to another practice (recommended by a co-worker) and took my x-rays from Carmel Foot Specialists. The new doctor told me that the x-rays were of \""such poor quality\"" that there was no way anyone could make a diagnosis from them, adding \""it's typical for podiatrists to utilize poor imaging equipment\"". The new doctor scheduled an MRI based on his exam and my symptoms, and I now have a diagnosis and a treatment plan--something that Carmel Foot Specialists was not able to provide, even after two separate visits, yet billed me over $500. What a waste of time."
0,"Went to this practice several times and saw Dr. Lind.  We were told that my son needed  an orthotic for planters fascia tis.  We purchased a lower priced orthotic to begin with. The first orthotic failed within a month so we returned and purchased a more expensive orthotic (more than $300) and told it had a 1 year warranty.  Unfortunately, it failed in less than one year. In fact, it was cutting into my son's foot. So we returned.  We asked to have the orthotic replaced.  Dr. Lind did not even examine my son's foot and flippantly stated, \""I'd like to see you get some more wear out of these\"".  This was after we complained that the orthotic was cutting into my son's foot.  We had to pay our regular co-pay for this visit and Dr. Lind (I'm not sure if he's a credentialed doctor or not)  sent my son on his way, foot still hurting.. and NEVER EVEN TOOK THE TIME TO REMOVE HIS SOCK TO SEE WHERE THE ORTHOTIC WAS CUTTING HIM.  If I were you, I'd think twice before going to this practice or taking my child there.  I complained to his office.  I was told someone would be calling me. I've yet to hear anything.  I'm sending a formal complaint to the North Carolina Board of Podiatry Examiners.  This is why insurance rates are so high."
0,"My daughter was referred here to have an ingrown toenail removed.  The doctor did a fine job, but I was disappointed in other aspects of this practice.  The phone number on the web doesn't work - must be an old one.  The office building sits back off the road and is easy to find, and when I called to get landmarks, while trying to find it, the auto answering announcement came on saying that due to high call volume, all operators were busy.  Luckily we found the building about 5 min. later.  One other lady walked in the door just before us, but no one else in the lobby.  No phones ringing off the hook, one receptionist actually \""receiving\"" us, and another was surfing the www, looking at dresses!  High call volume???  Riiiight!  Even though I told them that my daughter didn't swallow pills and needed a liquid antibiotic, they prescribed her 500mg horse capsules that I was supposed to get her to eat - mixed in something.  It smelled and tasted awful.  They decided to extend the length of time she was on it, but didn't inform me.  I found out from the school nurse who spoke to them about givng the meds at school.  The culture came back, and they needed to change the antibiotic anyway.  The assistant who called to tell me that they had called a new Rx in to the pharmacy said that she couldn't tell me what type of infection my daughter had.  I told her to have the doctor call me back, but to give me about 30 min. to get home so that I could write it down.  Of course that part of the message didn't get through because he called me 10 min. later while I was drivng and could take down the name of the infection.  From what I could remember of the type of infection, when I googled it, I couldn't find anything, so I still don't know what it was, and have put in another call.  When I asked him about the antibiotic, he had trouble telling me about it.  Today, I called again, and requested that they send the records to the pediatrician, and was told that they had gotten \""lost\"" because they send their dictations out of state for processing and had to send them again.  I simply do not get a good feeling about practice!"
0,"I was a patient of Dr. Lind.   I was prescribed a medication that needed to be specially made and sent to me and after a week I hadn't received and called and found they never ordered it.  Looked past that and this week had terrible pain in my foot. I called on Monday morning and again Tuesday and didn't receive a call until Wednesday, which I missed but called back later.  Never heard from them again.  The Park Road office has terrible management and are very unprofessional.  Since I couldn't reach Carmel Foot Specialists and they do not return calls in a remotely timely manner I went in to get my records.  I was very unhappy with them and the office manager was extremely unprofessional including a parting comment of 'Have a Nice Day' meant to be sarcastic.  I advise getting to a podiatrist who has his office managed well.  I have never been treated so badly by a physicians office.  I clearly got the message that patients come and go and none of them are important.  \nThey will not be there if you need them ,  I highly suggest you find another practice."
0,Dr. Hull is great but not great enough to overcome the poor treatment from the business office.  Don't ask for anything out of the ordinary like calling in a mail order script.  They are a well oiled machine and you are truly just a number there.
0,"Run, don't walk, away from Carmel Family Physicians!\n\nI've been a patient of CFP for about 3 years.  I've never really been happy, but as I've been looking to leave the area, I hadn't pursued another doctor until now.  By far the biggest problem they have is their phone/support staff.\n\nI certainly don't expect CFP to diagnose me over the phone, but if I contact them for a follow up on an appointment I had, it's like pulling teeth to get a call back.  Calls typically take multiple business days to be returned - if they are at all.  This includes the time that I was in pain to the point I was spending 1/2 the day in bed.  Or the time I was traveling and forgot my prescription, and asked for a small quantity to be prescribed as I was 2000 miles away from the only bottle I had.  I've even called and spoken with management about not getting timely callbacks, but nothing has changed after months!\n\nTheir patient referral service isn't any better.  I've been called and \""told\"" by their staff when my referred appointment was - without any input from me on what fits my schedule.  I've tried asking them for the name of the doctor so I can make my own appointment, only to be told they don't have that and only the referral person does.  Or the time I was in pain making it impossible to leave bed, and the only doctor they could refer me to didn't have any appointments for 1.5 months - and they had no other suggestions on where to go.  \n\nThe final straw was when I inquired about a preventive medicine for me.  The response I was given amounted to \""I've heard of that, but I don't know enough about it to be comfortable prescribing it.\""  There was no willingness for the doctor to research and follow up to me.  He couldn't even recommend a specialist who was familiar with it - and this wasn't an experimental treatment - this was a relatively new, but manufacturer-recognized use of a 10+ year old medicine.\n\nI don't think I've ever felt that CFP was customer-focused.  Rather, when I go there, I feel like I am viewed as a \""necessary evil\"" for them to collect their money.  Don't go here - you will regret it."
0,"Pretty disappointed. I was excited to try this place out for a late dinner, after reading all the previous reviews; just wanted to go and place a to-go order. Arrived at 9:35pm, and they told us the kitchen was closed. Most restaurants have to serve until their closing time (which was 10pm). Maybe it's just Chinese places that stop serving? I'm not sure. But I'm not used to walking into a place BEFORE they close and being sent away. They lost my business for good. I know I should have called beforehand. I normally wouldn't go to a restaurant that close to closing time, but when I do, they at least take my money!"

0,"Worst restaurant I have eaten at in a very long time.  I do not understand why this place has any stars at all.\n\nThey were out of basic sushi, like tuna etc.\nThe servers were rude.\nThree of us were there for dinner on Wednesday, they brought out one persons meal, then after that person was done eating, they brought out the second persons meal, and then after that person was done eating, they brought out the last meal, (which was sushi, so should not have taken an hour).\n\nSo each person had to eat their dinner while the other two watched.\n\nThe sushi menu was stapled scraps of paper that looked like it was made by a kindergartner, and was very limited, missing even basic items, like salmon roll, tuna roll, eel roll, etc.  Salmon roe (Ikura) was dried out, so I didn't even eat it, and they only gave me a half portion.  (The Ikura can say a lot about a place.. it should be wet and firm, so they explode in your mouth when you apply pressure with your teeth.  If they are sticky, deflated, over-salted and mushy, they are no good, and the pace probably isn't either.) \n\nMy brother got the pork ramen soup and said it was the worst he has ever eaten.. the noodles were pasty, the broth had WAY too much salt, etc.  He said it was worse than the packaged stuff.\n\nThe place was also dirty, especially the bathrooms.\n\nIt was a horrible experience in almost every way a place can be horrible.  There is no chance we will EVER go back!  Stay away from this place, FAR AWAY!"
0,"Arrived, party of 6 on a Wednesday night. Host would not acknowledge our presence, wasted :30 mins of our time figuring out whether we could get a table or not.\n\nTerrible service."
0,"The staff is rude, hung up on me, you can't get ahold of anyone higher up. there have been multiple break ins. They intimidate their residents even if they are current on all bills. the pool is disgusting, there is vomit on our stairs yet to be cleaned up. Garbage sits on peoples door steps for days on end. All of the staff has a compulsive lying problem, they lie even when they don't need to. They had an elderly man's truck towed after the tires were STOLEN, because it didn't comply with the lease. Keep in mind, the mans wife was in the hospital at the time. They tried to evict a cop who had a lease, because he wasn't paying enough. The Connor Group has over 300 complaints against them with the BBB. If you want to keep your sanity, do not sign a lease with the Connor Group. They lie, steal, and cheat without any reservations. They are also trying to up our rent by over $200 by the time you add in all of the extra fees they make you pay for services they don't actually provide. if you want to pay by credit card, they charge you $10 every time you pay."
0,Don't move here this place is horrible! The only thing it has going for it is that it looks pretty... There is something always wrong with the apartment. I would not ever recommend this place to anyone!

The carpet is NASTY, there are roaches, grounds are unkept. They don't fix problems...... The biggest thing is they lost the money !!!!!! Run,don't walk from this place!!!!! Biggest mistake I ever made!!!!! Karen"
0,"I hate to have to do this but I had such an awful experience today!  I visit the Uptown location so I had high hopes, but was extremely let down.  \n\nLong story short, I waited 20 minutes in line for a salad (there were only three people in front of me), the person working was completely untrained, the salad had SO much dressing on it that it was inedible and he ignored my request for goat cheese.  :(\n\nI hope they fix this issue soon!!"
0,"\""WOW, this place is EXPENSIVE!\"" ... is what I would say if Dean & Deluca cut all their prices in half.\n\nI'm giving them 1 star because I feel that they make no effort at all to cater to anyone other than the uber-rich.   Like everything else in Phillips Place, D&D is just another spot where the wealthiest people in Charlotte can spend obscene sums of money on stuff they really don't need, while the rest of the country struggles to find employment and to stop their houses from being foreclosed upon.\n\nDon't get me wrong, D&D has high-quality, delicious foods.  If I had a few million dollars in the bank, and didn't mind getting ripped off, I'd probably do all my shopping here."
0,"Consumer Fraud part II\nYes their selection of cold cuts, cheeses etc are quality, therefore expensive items but D&D prices them even higher than the competition.  Where's Zabar when we need them? The espresso is very good, I stopped for an espresso and a croissant and there again was that inviting glass of \""fresh\"" orange juice in front of me. I ask what kind of OJ is it, fresh squeezed or pasteurized?Tropicana IOWs. To me the big deal is that pasteurizing always changes the taste of the juice, even if it's \""flash pasteurized\""\n\nBoth young ladies behind the counter swear high and low that it's fresh squeezed and that's what they are instructed to tell customers.  I buy it, taste it, inform them that it's indeed pasteurized, demand to see the bottle and promise to apologize profusely if I'm wrong. The cashier asks me if I want her to check what the bottle says, I say please yes and she runs off to do it. The girl is back in a NY minute later and tells me \""I'm sorry, you were right\"" \n\nThe manager runs over and refunds my breakfast, her dumb excuse is that \""they don't have a machine to squeeze oranges\"". I tell her that's no reason to train the personnel to lie to the customers (no answer) and that they don't need to squeeze oranges any way, Fresh OJ is sold by the gallon anyway. I got lots of sorry, sorry but no assurance that they will stop that shoddy practice. I'm pretty sure that they will keep on marketing it as \""fresh\"" anyway. \n\nThis is inexcusable: Harris Teeter retails fresh OJ for $0.08 a fl oz - http://shop.mywebgrocer.com/shop.aspx?strid=E277212 - since D&D charges $2.75 a glass, they could buy it at FULL RETAIL  ($0.48) and still make a 500% markup!!\nLike I said , no excuse and that's their second location were I caught them doing this.\n\nOh and yes their soups are excellent BTW"
0,"I don't have a problem paying high prices as long as the quality lives up to the pricing. D&D is expensive. However, the food quality simply doesn't warrant the cost. A piece of two layer cake, is over six dollars. They slice the cake up, then in an attempt to keep the slices fresh, they wrap the exposed sides of each piece. Good idea. However, many times, some portion of the slice is stale (who knows how long the cake has been sitting there). Their deli products, salads, etc., are not bad, but again, certainly not better than what can be purchased elsewhere for less. I guess I just expect quality comensurate with cost, and certainly don't see much evidence of it here. As a result, we are usually not patrons, too many other places serve better food (regardless of price), why eat mediocre fare?"
0,"Beware!! They didn't even deserve a one star.\n This company and leasing managers are racist and treat people like they are nothing. All they want is you to sign on the dotted line and they got you! The 1 bedroom apartment we rented was a fucking DUMP when we moved in. The ceiling fan was ready to fall on our heads, there was black all over the a/c vents and the shelves in the closet were literally falling off the wall and the carpet had huge nasty stains everywhere. We were told our place was clean and ready to move in. \nI have a medical condition called Cystic Fibrosis, I am on a lot of medication and my meds get delivered by UPS or FedEx to the front office. After the third box of my meds arrived, in about a weeks time, the leasing staff labeled me as being contagious and treated me like dirt. \nAfter being there for two months, my doctor at MUSC in Charleston told me I have to live close to the hospital in order to get proper treatment and be able to go into the hospital when I am sick. We gave a written notice to the leasing manager and a doctors letter. The manager said, oh that's fine don't worry about it feel better (in her fake voice). Now, two years later I see they have put me on collection for $2000. \nNo way will they get away with this. Do not rent from these Losers! How do they sleep at night"
0,"HORRIBLE PLACE TO LIVE!\n\nFIRST OF ALL..... these apartments are NOT IN BALLANTYNE!!!!  This place has changed dramatically since I first moved in. It used to be quiet and peaceful. The genius who decided to design some of the apartments to where their bedroom is literally in the hallway of the building....Smh. I can hear EVERY...SINGLE...CONVERSATION that goes on in the hallway. You complain about noisy neighbors...they won't do anything about them. I have called the police multiple times on neighbors fighting, arguing. I have found a couple of dead roaches. There are spiders everywhere. In the spring, the carpenter bees take over and they claim there is nothing they can do. I had to call numerous times about wasps building nests outside my door and no one responding. The pools.....I'd never go there. Nice looking.....creepy people that watch women swim. Disturbing. I haven't had any major problems with office staff but I feel like they do just enough to not get major complaints."
0,Nothing had improved. My toilet keeps getting stopped up and you have to call the office multiple times sometimes to get someone to come out. \n\nI NOW HAVE ROACHES AND MY APARTMENT HAS ALREADY BEEN SPRAYED ONCE. I'M BEYOND DISGUSTED.
0,Dead Roach on the Bamboo on my steam dumpling basket. I got up and left. This is the only time i've gotten up and left besides an hour wait at Denny's.  F'ing gross!!
0,"I had a horrible experience getting take out from the local PF Changs take out. I had been home and not feeling well the last couple of days craving take out from PF Chang's. I found it the worst food I have ever gotten at from PF Changs in 2 states in the last 10 years. The gallon of \""fresh\"" tea was so syrupy I could not drink it. The vegetarian dish had soggy vegetables and awful tasting curry that I could not eat it. The side order of fried green beans was soft, soggy, and very cold with a poorly made fish sauce on the side. I could not eat any of it and I spent a small fortune ordering for my family. I would have returned it for a reorder, however I have been getting over an illness and not able to drive. My daughter who picked it up had to leave. What happened to this restaurant? It was an awful dining experience and I do expect some type of reparation for this terrible eating experience. I ended up eating crackers and peanut butter at home instead. Just awful!\n\nTo add insult to injury, this is the same restaurant where I found that the wait staff would pocket the change from the bill when paid with cash. I let this pass the first time and the 2nd time I asked the manager if this was their policy, with an embarrassed looks from the nearby wait staff. \n\nI used to absolutely love this chain, however it has become a poor excuse for a restaurant. I wrote the main office"

0,"Great experience in previous visit in Orlando so tried this one in Charlotte. Apps were cold.  Waiter was loud and too casual.  Cream curdled in coffee.  Sea bass was steamed spinach coated in soy sauce.  After I have been to all other Charlotte restaurants, we may try it again."
0,"Another bad experience two times in a row. There must be a shortage of waitstaff in Charlotte because these people shouldn't even be working at Walmart. Both times we went for lunch and took an hour and a half. They served soup which took almost 40 minutes to get egg drop and it look like low tide in Louisiana. Big chunks of gray and black eggs floating in my egg drop soup, waitress looking at me like I was crazy. The manager came over to serve our food and asked how is everything I mention I was going to write a bad Yelp review and he said well thank you and walked away. This place used to have a long wait and now there's nobody ever there, now I understand why. Portions are small, service is bad and probably better off going to McDonald's."
0,"I ordered take out from this P.F. Chang's on Tuesday night and have to say that is was terrible. Not only I was the food ready 45min later than the time frame they gave me over the phone, the food was soggy, underprepard and bland. For example, the Kung Pao Shrimp was not fried as it is supposed to be and doughy. My family always orders this dish in various locations and this was by far the worst. \n\nDelay and food preparations aside, what really sets me off is that I not only waited 45 min to receive my food (altogether the preparation time was well over 60min), I have received nothing from the management as an apology but plenty of negative attitude.\n\n Maybe I am spoiled but in every P.F. Changs I have been so far, I have received a credit on the bill or a voucher if something is off. This time I have received nothing (only a half hearted apology of the manager). \n\nin my opinion, if a customer waits 45min in the restaurant for a $110 pickup order made on the phone, prepays AND still gives $5 tip, I expect to get something off the bill. Here, however, I have received nothing.\n\nI will not visit this restaurant anymore and cannot recommend it. Sadly it has lost its game - maybe it was the Tusday manager."
0,"I'll give this HT one star, but honestly...not even worth that. After months of construction and inconvenience, they still don't have their act together.

Self checkout registers are rarely open; floor is half installed (tripped on this twice); merchandise mell pell all over the store blocking aisles...even though I live a block from this HT, I'll go the few extra miles to Southpark.  Steer clear of this HT until they get it together - and oh joy...a McDonald's is going in the parking lot...there goes the neighborhood!!"
0,"I've tried it twice and won't be going back.The first was a romantic meal with the wife; decor is an interesting talking point but creates more of a roadside dinner feel rather than the white table cloth experience. Bread was good and service good, I had fish which was OK and the wife had steak which was good but the a filet had too much grizzle for her. The second visit was a works lunch, I had planned Del Frisco's for an American steak house experience for overseas guests but it was closed so decided to try the Palm. Big mistake, lunch menu was poor and the dinner menu is very over priced, the place was empty (not suprised) and my NY strip and fries was the worst steak I've ever paid for. Overcooked, tough and tasted like it had gone bad. I won't return to places that serve bad food knowingly.\n\nThe works lunch for three with soft drinks came to over $200 with tip, I don't mind paying for good food but thats a rip off for what we were served.\n\nPro's; The place has a traditional steakhouse feel and good waiters, the bread is excellent and location nice, not to busy, easy to park and nice for a stroll after diner.\n\nCon's; The food is so over priced, the quality wasn't good and the whole experience very poor."

0,"I ordered the seafood special under \""Chef Specialties\"" Was supposed to have shrimp, scallops & crab. Guess what? NO CRAB. Manager explains they took it out because people didn't like the fake crab meat. Well don't advertise as real crab & take it off the menu!!!!! The manager didn't offer anything. It would have been nice if they had told me this before I ordered. The noodles were soggy as well... This place put me in a BAD mood & I will never, I mean never go here again!"

0,"Unfortunately, a Charlotte main stay has worn out the welcome pad.  My husband took the kids on Sunday and he said \""now I remember, the last time we were here we said we would never go back\"".  The meals are over priced and just ok in terms of quality. When my husband spoke to the manager, he could care less about it. (Which is the same thing that happened the last time we were there).  So, to anyone reading this, I would look for another breakfast option."
0,"I do not get it.  Why does this place get voted Best Breakfast?!  We had been once before and the pancakes tasted funky and the eggs tasted fishy.  Tried again today and were again sorely disappointed.  After struggling to piece together a breakfast and being told we couldn't do certain things because \""the computer won't let us,\"" we again got a sub-par breakfast.  So if you want to wakey, wakey, eggs & bac-y, avoid this place.  You will only get eggo waffles and funky tasting food."

0,"The experience of shopping in this store, and interacting with their representatives on the floor, is the epitome of why Amazon is so successful.  Not only did they not have a book that was extensively distributed, but never offered another possibility of making the sale (I.E.

0,"This used to be a great company to work with. The products were made well and the service used to be outstanding. Now buyer be ware. I have had nothing but headaches with my orders. First was with the drapery order I placed in July. My drapes still are not up because of one debacle after another. First some of the hardware didn't arrive, then it came in the wrong finish, then the didn't include as stated drapery hooks and they are back ordered till Jan. 2014. Then hung a pair of drapes and the other pair for another window in the same room wasn't the length stated, then I called to have the right length sent. Oh sorry mam, they have been discontinued you will have to take down the pair you just hung and order something else and by the way it is going to cost you an additional $200 dollars. 4.5 mos. later I am still dealing with their screw ups. Ordered a very a very large and heavy coat rack. A friend and I worked on this for 3 hours, it should have taken no more than 30 min. We could not get it together because it didn't line up. Sorry mam, you will have to pack up this very large and heavy item and set it out to be picked up. Have spent a lot of $$$$ and would have had better service and products had I gone to Walmart. They used to be a great company, I have been brought to tears and all I have gotten is a smug and condescending attitude. When I complained to one of the online managers and explained my disappointment with he had no sensitivity to all I have been through and at one point even tried to point the finger back at me. At one point told him I would be telling everyone I came in contact with and the internet media how horrible my experience has been, his reply \"" Do what you have to do!\"" Wow, were has customer service gone?"
0,"So help me God, if I ever get married or have a sex change and need a tuxedo, I am never coming to this Men's Warehouse again.\n\nWe unluckily got helped by Morgan to get fitted for a wedding my boyfriend is in this upcoming July. From the get go, the gum-chewing-lip-smacking Morgan was completely lacking in anything remotely close to customer service. We arrived with a coupon from David's Bridal for $40 off a tux rental and was met with the realization that it was for Prom only (despite the small print not saying Prom only rentals). When I told her where we'd gotten the code, she agreed that yes, a $40 coupon was in David's Bridals free catalogs at the store, but she was unable to use any coupon codes to get the discount.\n\nSo let me go over this: I have a coupon. Give coupon. Not valid on this transaction, but there are other coupons in the same place you got this. I don't have that coupon. Sorry cannot help you even though I know that coupon exists and the code is simply DBAW and 6 numbers.\n\nWow, wow and wow. Some of you out there might be saying \""Well, you have the wrong coupon and even if the fine print didn't say prom only, it's what it was and too bad\"" but here's the thing: CUSTOMER SERVICE. Customer service means service with a smile (no smile on Morgan but sloppy dress and bra showing, check!). Customer Service means going above and beyond (perhaps giving us a working coupon to use). Customer service means using your brain and not being a complete idiot when it comes to common sense.\n\nSo, what did I do when she rang up the charge full price? I called David's Bridal in NorthLake and got AMAZING customer service by the first person who picked up who was glad to tell me the current wedding coupon code, which I told to an apathetic Morgan. Me - 1, Her - 0. Chick, you don't even know the lengths I will go to so that we can save money with or without your horrible help.\n\nAnd what's a cake without icing? Totally watched a dude smoke in front of the store and then come in and measure my boyfriend for the tux without washing his hands. Hands, cigarette, mouth, touching customers. YUCK!"
0,My groomsman and I bought the suits for my wedding here. 4 of us that I know were sized wrong.  Customer service was terrible. After we purchased our suits they would not correct it.  Highly recommend not buying a suit here.  These people do not know what they're doing.

0,"My boyfriend and I decided to go see a movie this past Sunday & wanted to grab a few appetizers before heading that way. We walked over to Upstream to check out the menu and immediately loved their options! \nWe headed straight for the bar where we were greeted immediately and requested two waters and two menus. About 5 minutes later we were still without waters or menus & our bartender was nowhere to be seen (there were only about 3 or 4 other people sitting at the bar)...so I had to go to the host stand to look for some. \nWe each ordered the lobster bisque and decided to share the sweet and sour calamari. The lobster bisque came out lukewarm which made it completely unappetizing and had one small piece of lobster in the middle that turned out to be rubbery when we went to eat it!!!\nWe moved on to the calamari which was AMAZING and delicious!!!! Unfortunately, it was a pretty small serving for what we were paying so again we were disappointed but this time with the quantity.\nWhile dining our waters actually sat empty for pretty much the entire time the food was in front of us...very frustrating! We finally flagged down a server who was passing by to fill us up, which she did, BUT was not happy about it which she made very obvious with the annoyed long loud sigh she let out as she walked away. \nThroughout our meal not a single person stopped to check and see if our food was good or if we wanted to order anything else. We were never spoken to after our order was taken and had to flag someone down to request our bill. \nMy boyfriend and I eat out ALL the time and usually spend somewhere between $100 - $400 for dinner each time we go out (which is at least once a week). This time we were in and out diners who were excited to test a new place for a potential new date spot...they failed completely! We can forgive soup being lukewarm or even overpaying here and there....BUT not being completely ignored like we had no place dining there because we were only ordering a few quick appetizers and water. Best of luck to other diners, we unfortunately must have come on a bad night..."

0,"Looks like I am not the only one that had a poor experience at this UPS store. I went in to ship a package that I needed to return to Amazon. The owner barely glanced at my package, told me the box I had was \""too big for the item,\"" and that I would need to purchase one from him for $6.95. I'm not sure how the box could have been \""too big,\"" if it was the same box Amazon used to ship the item to me. I had even added my own bubble wrap, just to be sure the item was secure. The owner was very confrontational during the entire exchange. I would have given him the benefit of the doubt and said maybe he was just having a bad day, but judging by these other reviews, he is ALWAYS having a bad day.

When I got home, 2 pairs of pants had been shrunk (tighter through the leg, slightly shorter inseam). Both of these had been dry cleaned before (at another location) and did not shrink. 4 weeks later I am still waiting on my other shirts. I have called and was told that the stains cannot be removed, it must have been my cologne, and that I would have to take them back to the store I bought them from and claim a \""manufacturer defect.\"" This is completely unacceptable. Neither shirt has been worn more than 7 or 8 times each, and both have been dry cleaned before, and I always wear cologne, and I have never had this problem. They refuse to do anything about it.

The owner will not take responsibility for the stains, address me directly, or offer a reimbursement for the ruined clothing.  BAD BUSINESS!!  I will not be returning!

My partner and I are great fan of papa johns pizza but this particular location has the worst pizza/breadsticks and service.
0,I would hardly call this place a spa. They were extremely overcrowded and the utensils were not sanitized properly. The employees were rude (probably because they have so many clients at once).

0,"I purchased a 2002 Mercury Sable from my uncle out of the area. On the drive to Charlotte I noticed a slight stutter when at red lights.

Cost for the job. $857.00 I said no. \"" brought my car to you for a tune up and thats what I want. How much for the tune up?\"" Answer: $450.00 Yep!! $450.00 I said no. The problem is that I had agreed when signing the paperwork to a $115.00 diagnostic fee. So I could walk away but it would cost me $115.00 for nothing. Congrats to Town and Country. You got the $115. and I did not complain one bit. I had agreed to the terms. But I took my car and left and I will never ever reccomend this place or do business with them again. PS.

I have purchased dozens of cars over the years and have never given my social before all the numbers were given. The salesman told me either I let them run my social or they wouldn't do business. At no time did a manager come over and help out. I basically was told either I do it their way or I needed to walk. He told me to leave and that there is no way I could get the deal I wanted. Needless to say I purchased the same vehicle from Keith Hawthorne Ford a couple hours later for less than what I was trying to buy the car for at Town and Country. Some could say that the dealership does not deserve a bad review based on this rather, the salesman didn't do their job. I thought this at first, I just have been asking myself why wouldn't the manager come over and try to stop me from leaving or help work on the deal. Specially, as it was obvious they had a newer salesman."
0,"I recently came here for a safety recall having to do with the cruise control of my 2002 Ford Explorer. I had sent an online request for an appointment Tuesday for the recall service (free) and to get \""THE WORKS? FUEL SAVER PACKAGE $39.95 OR LESS\"" which includes free tire rotation. Two days later, I called them after receiving no response. They said that they were having trouble with their e-mail system and to come in on Friday, which I did, arriving around 7:15 in the morning. That, along with tire rotation and oil change, had me ready about 8:45 or so. Unfortunately, the first time, they had charged me for the recall service, which I had to have them correct since per Ford, this should be no charge to me. Because I was in a hurry, I failed to get them to also remove the charge for the tire rotation which was supposed to have been included for free as part of my package. I feel this service department is dishonest and intentionally attempts to avoid honoring their advertised discounts. Very sorry I came here and will not purchase a new car from them in the future."
0,I'm still getting mailers from this place. Nope. I won't go. Keep your stinky coupons. Boo.
0,"I had an appointment to see a vehicle on Saturday at 10:15 am, this was confirmed Friday evening also by them. On Saturday morning I drove the hour and forty five minutes to see the vehicle that they had advertised. To my very surprise, it happened to had been sold that morning and, no one bothered to call me. They stated in their ad that you make a VIP appointment and they will have the vehicle available. I believe that the vehicle did not even exist and they just wanted me in there to sell me something else. This is the worst experience with a dealership I have ever had. The manager could care less and the Internet person lied that she tried to call me 30 minutes prior to my arrival which is absolutely absurd!! Does anyone care what happened, NO. I would warn everyone to watch doing business with this dealership , something shady going on here."
0,"I would NEVER suggest that anyone shop for a used vehicle at this Ford dealership.  The used car Sales Manager is lacking character and integrity.  They had a vehicle priced online right at the price we were looking for so we went in to see the vehicle.  It was a very basic, no feature vehicle for a college student.  Once we agreed to purchase it, they came out with a price $1000 higher than what was listed.  The Sales Manager came out and tried to make excuses for a 3rd party company that posts their sales ads and that it was their mistake...we told him it wasn't our issue.  He then proceeded to LIE to us about the costs they put into the vehicle...since they would never put into it more than what it's worth.  This man should not be in the position he's in, as they could have easily made up for their $1K mistake just in the day and should have honored the price they advertised...and to sit and lie to our face?  Get some integrity loser!"
0,"I only gave them one star because it may look like I just didn't rate them if I left it at 0. WORST PLACE EVER!! I was told by a rude salesperson and an even more rude manager that I did not qualify for the 04 ford expedition I went to see before I was even given an opportunity to test drive. After leaving highly upset I stopped down the road at City Chevrolet where I was greeted by a courteous sales professional by the name of Avon Spann \""THE CHEVY MANN\"". Not only did he get me in a 2014 vehicle which I didn't qualify for as far as ford was concerned. But he treated me so well I don't want to buy cars from anyone or anywhere else. Even if you want a Ford still go see The CHEVY MANN @ City Chevrolet. He'll get you anything you ask for. My brother is working with him to buy a BMW that is in Tallahassee, FL"
0,not happy with this dealership because you cant reach anyone in service and it goes straight to the answering machine and then they never return your calls.
0,"Everybody here is very rude,  especially Bill. I stood and waited and asked if someone could help me.  One employee actually WALKED AWAY FROM ME! Bill spent 20 minutes on his cell phone talking about everything but what's related to the dealership. I asked Bill what it would cost to service my car and I got a figure that was completely different than what I was quoted on the phone.  I told him about the quote and he said he would check on it. I wait, and wait, and wait.  It took 30 minutes for him to get back to me and said that nobody here gave me that quote  (I got the impression that he thought I was lying by his tone) and it has always been a certain price and always will be a certain price. I think I will look for another place to have my car serviced next time because of the rudeness and because of the customer service."
0,"We went here because there was a wobble and wup wup wup noise coming from one of our wheels.  After they put the car up on the lift and inspected it, they told us that we needed all new struts (front and rear), a new wheel, alignment, and balancing.  I think the estimate was about $1000 for all that.  Then I asked why they recommended replacing the front struts if the problem that caused the wheel to wear was in the back.  The explanation I got was that the front struts didn't *need* to be replaced, but they recommended it because of the struts' age.  That brought the total down to around $500.\n\nSo then I'm scratching my head wondering how the struts in the rear can be bad, because there's no noise or softness or weird bounce in the rear suspension (or the front, for that matter).  My gut told me to get a second opinion.\n\nSo we took the car out east to my wife's regular family mechanic.  He checks it out thoroughly, says the struts are all fine, replaces a bad wheel (a different one than that identified by Tire Kingdom), and balances/aligns all four wheels.\n\nAbout $280 later, the car drives great.\n\nNot sure what was going on at Tire Kingdom, maybe they just reached a bad diagnosis in good faith.  I'm just glad we took our car elsewhere."
0,"We have gone to this Pizza Hut in the past and were not satisfied with the service. When we first moved to our house, this location and the one at Lawyers & Margaret Wallace both argued as to which location was supposed to deliver to us! We didn't feel like leaving the house last night and decided to give them another chance. They were 20 minutes late, the pizza and wings were cold, and the customer service was terrible! I will not be ordering from this place again. I am really surprised this location has been in business as long as it has."
0,"This is the last straw!  I love bojangles, and this one is conveniently located on the way home for me, but enough is enough. I have put up with their slow service, wrong orders,  and annoying employees who are horrible at taking orders. But yesterday I stopped on the way home and was given cold, leathery chicken supremes; seasoned fries with absolutely no seasoning; and a cold, hard biscuit. I will continue to go to bojangles, but never this one again!"
0,We took my wife's Sorento into for service on her A/C for the first time in March. They told us it was her compressor and they replaced it. Luckily we had a extended warranty and they covered most of it. That didn't work so we took it back. They said it was a bad control unit and wanted $600+ to replace it. I found it online for just over $400 and I replaced it myself. That didn't fix it so we took it back again. They said it was a bad control module and that they were going to replace it. They charged us for the replacement but didn't replace it and then determined it was a bad replacement control unit. They ordered a warranty replacement and I picked it up (much to their disappointment) and put it in myself. That didn't work either and after spending over $1000 and wasting two plus months with them we took it to Dale Jarrett Kia in Monroe. They determined it was a different module that determines the temperature was bad from the beginning and had most likely been the culprit the whole time. They were able to get Kia to warranty TWO new control units that were damaged because the module had burned the other two out. They had it two weeks straight but were able to finally diagnose the cause and origin of the problem. Folger Kia has got to be the worse dealership in the Charlotte area. We spoke directly with Kia corporate and they apologized for how horrible Folger Kia was and how badly they treated us. My wife went in when we were finished dealing with Folger to get a receipt to give to Dale Jarrett and Mike Melton treated her horribly. I will NEVER use or recommend Folger Kia to anyone. They are dishonest and their customer service is terrible. If you have to use a Kia dealer go to Dale Jarrett. It isn't that far but your experience will be so much better.
0,"This place is slimey as all heck & a disgrace to the KIA brand.  I chose to go to this dealership because I was under the pretense of a false trade-in promotion.  Their claimed minimum trade-in value does not pertain to the vast majority of their car lot. Their selection is extremely weak (they only carrying a handful of each model).  \n\nIn the last decade I've purchased cars from the Independence Carmax (twice), Scott Clark Toyota & Hilbush Ford.  I prefer all of them over Folger Kia."
0,"DO NOT BUY A CAR from FOLGER KIA. In march, we bought a Kia sportage for $10500, the top end of the estimated value via Kelly blue book. When I drove the car in April, the AC was not working well. I specifically asked if this car was in good shape and Shamori (the finance manager)  assured me it was. In April we had to replace All 4 tires and the battery at a cost of $700. I gave Shamori a chance to take care of this, he took it to Rick (the general manager) who said no. We are now faced with replacing the AC compressor  - a $1200-$1500 repair. Despite assurances that they would stand by their product, Folger Kia has deliberately decided to not take care of over $2000 worth of repairs I had to make.  DO NOT BUY A CAR from FOLGER KIA."
0,...and this chit-hole is still open??  WHY???  Must be so the gang-bangers have a place to conduct target practice.
0,"Unfortunately, I live near Eastland Mall. The place is in shambles, and while I like the prices at some of the ghetto-tastic clothing stores enough that I sometimes venture in there, I've mostly stopped going all together. I tried to use the Radio Shack in this mall to get help with my Sprint Cell phone, and the music in the store was so loud I couldn't get the staff to hear me. The guy behind the desk, who I later discovered was a manager, acted as if I were disturbing him.\n\nI've gotten my eyebrows waxed at Foxy Nails, and the price was right...but again, the service was a little lacking."

0,"First off, I NEVER right reviews unless it's positive. Since I am a small business owner and work in customer service, I know the impact of word of mouth. Let me just say Meineke gave me the worst service I've received in my year and a half since moving to NC. First visit, a mechanic talked me out of getting my brakes repaired after I came in expressing concern about a grinding deeling I experience when I back up. Nothing is wrong, its just the brakes adjusting after it rains he said. Your brake pads & shoes have 40% left he said. A month later I was at Lexus getting my shoes AND rotors replaced. AND was told the front had 5% wear left... and like an idiot, I returned fir my last free oil change (2 free preferred oil changes from Groupon). From the beginning I should've turned around. I came in expressing I ONLY want my preferred oil change because they dropped the ball on the brakes. After explaining the last situation, there was no offer to rectify the matter in any way. A mechanic doing the oil change brought me to the back to show me my front brakes like I didn't just tell him what he was telling me. Then told me I need an air filter. Smh. Simple quick fix. I tell him to add it. Can't mess that up right? Wrong. It took an extra 35 mins to add the add filter. Then I get my bill and see they've only done a BASIC oil change. No topping of fluids, no rotating of my tires... so I ask what oil change did you do? The mechanic says Basic. And I asked, what does the Groupon say? He says Preferred. And I said, my car requires a synthetic blend. And what happened to my tired rotation? The mechanic said oh we rotated the tires too; I watched him do it. Everything that should've been done is handled miss. I go outside, and the same chalk marking that was there on my left rear tire, is still there, on the left rear. Smh. I was already late for my next appointment and beyond sick of this ordeal so I left. And the ENTIRE time this disaster is happening, the store manager is periodically coming out to greet everyone who comes in EXCEPT me. He hears my complaint, and NEVER comes out to at least apologize for any inconvenience. I just pray their basic oil change doesn't harm my engine. I will never in life return to nor will I recommend Meineke as a company to trust your car with!"
0,"This dealer has no intention of making good on discounts offered.  I clearly received an email offer for $50 to be used AS CASH on ANY repair, they would not let me use it to repair my key fob which broke during normal use, just like yours will someday as they don't make them to last, they know they will break, it's a well documented problem."
0,"Went there for the first time last Saturday. While the beer menu is impressive, being out of a couple of beers I wanted to try doesn't help. And our waitress, while cute and helpful, was new, so she needed our help in getting the right beers ordered.\n\nWe then ordered food. My GF's \""Rocket Tots\"" were tasty, although she only got like... 14 of them for $6.99 so it wasn't a good value at all. I ordered a burger, which was the worst I've had since I moved to Charlotte in 2003. The meat had a sour, \""off\"" taste, and the meat was cooked within an inch of its life. It was so dry that it was impossible to eat without liquid. What's more, I ordered it with Red Dragon cheese (and extra $1), and it was a depressing, congealed mass on top. The 9 fries that came with the meal were served at a less than ideal temp, but were nice and salty in spite of this.\n\nThe bottom line is that the waitresses are cute and in skimpy outfits, and the beer selection is good. But if you want to go here, eat somewhere else before you come.\nI'm also (literally) offended that the Flying Saucer charges 99\u00a2 for their iPhone and Android apps... but that is neither here nor there."
0,"Not a great selection of beer for a place called a \""Draught Emporium\"".  Also the food was less than mediocre and they were out both chicken tenders and pizza when we were there.  There are a lot of much better places to get craft beer and bar food in Charlotte."
0,"This place STUNK! Figuratively... I think the customer service, obtaining the car, was ridiculous, horrendous, incredulous!! We were waiting in line and they decided to only give good service to selective customers. We got....yelled at...By the person servicing us and he was just so rude, I had never, apart from the DMV, EVER gotten so upset. Of course, you'll be damned if you piss someone off in customer service because they will let you know! And we ended up waiting much longer than anyone else there to be handed the keys to a car that had been ready almost and hour and a half. I wish we had video cameras to record the absurd service we received. Granted, this is only for the people working here, not Hertz the company itself as I have had much much MUCH better service at Hertz elsewhere."
0,"Where to start with this review?\n\nWe went with Hertz because I did the Name Your Own Price option on Priceline, which up until this experience, had been quite beneficial for saving money, however I would not recommend this feature for rental cars because you may end up with Hertz.\n\nThe Charlotte Douglas airport location is fine as far as how easy it is to get to and the shuttle arrival and departure times. However, the people who run this location are entirely incompetent. \n\nFirst problem: Since I already had a reservation, I was forced to use this extremely bizarre video chat system where I picked up what equaled a pay phone and video chatted with a representative. This was while there were available representatives on site. The manager who \""dialed\"" the rep didn't explain the process at all.\n\nThe representative I spoke to was fine, but she misled me and tried to up-sell me twice and then completely lost interest in helping me when she realized she wasn't going to make her sales quota through me. This whole process was entirely confusing and I don't know why a company would EVER consider doing this. \n\nSecond problem: We were told where are car was parked, and although there were reps available, no one took us to where the car was. They just kind of pointed and said, \""It's near the fence.\"" Um, the entire place is surrounded by a fence! \n\nThird problem: They gave us no inspection paperwork. We had to get in the car, drive around and ask for it and then inspect the car ourselves. They took the paperwork afterwards, but who knows what they did with it!\n\nFourth problem: We returned the car 1 hour late, which meant we incurred a $30 fee for a late return. I understand that this is the policy, but didn't know before hand. The manager said he could do nothing except give me a gift certificate. Tough luck for me since I already swore up and down that I would never rent from Hertz again.  I resolved to call when I returned home.\n\nFifth problem: I called and emailed customer service about my charge. WHen I finally got a hold of someone, they told me that there was nothing they could do since I already accepted the gift certificate, and because I accepted it, it meant that I agreed the issue was resolved.\n\nThat's when I was really incensed since no one ever said that by accepting the certificate that I agreed I was OK with being charged $30/hour. Because I most certainly was not! As a \""goodwill\"" gesture, she reduced my fee by a whopping $15.38.\n\nConsider this your fair warning. If I could give this company zero stars, I would. Go with Enterprise instead. You'll probably pay more, but at least you won't have to deal with Hertz."
0,2 words: unorganized chaos. I hate when rental car companies are offsite from the airport. Then the line wrapped around the door & they only had 2 people helping people!!! Will be avoiding this place in the future.
0,One of the worst rental experiences of my life. Computers were down and had to write out rental agreements by hand. Waited over a hour for them to process 4 rentals. The line behind me very long and no concession was offered. Got a Chevy piece of junk Aveo. Talk about a tin can on wheels! Transmission sounded horrible (grinding sound) and could feel the vibration at certain speeds/gears. Barely had enough power to go up a hill and still maintain highway speed. Next time it Avis or anyone else beside Hertz.
0,Have yet to recieve my security deposit that i was suppose to get over three weeks ago. Horrible customer service and there is so many fee's after the fact that they will not inform you of. Not only will i never use hertz again i will suggest to anyone who visits to get basically anyone but hertz horrible.
0,"I waited an hour and a half for my car, from 9:30pm to 11,  on a humid Wednesday night in a waiting area that seemed to have no A/C. Staff was wildly disorganized, frazzled and, despite numerous questions from the room full of understandably frustrated customers, never gave a straight answer as to the exact nature of the problem. Employees behind the counter would disappear for 20, 30 minutes with no explanation. I finally confronted the manager as to why they had plenty of cars sitting idle over in the Gold Club section but were parceling out cars to us non-Gold people at a rate of 1 every 20 minutes! 30 minutes later, I was given a car in the Gold parking area. To be fair, my previous handful of experiences with Hertz at CLT were trouble free, but this experience has made me gun shy about using them ever again."
0,"I've used Hertz since I was old enough to rent a car, but I'll never go back after this experience. I initially spoke with an agent when I first arrived at Hertz. I specifically told her that I was going to add another driver. I received a slip of paper that said, in bold print, \""TOTAL ESTIMATED CHARGE.\"" I then gave her the information about the second driver, after which I received several more pieces of paper.\n\nI later found out that one of those slips was a second contract that said, in small, faint print, that I had to pay $13 for each day with a second driver. If I had known that I wouldn't have added the second driver.\n\nThis is clearly a rip off. Hertz should have printed a revised total that stated the updated price IN BOLD CAPITAL LETTERS, like they did with the original price.\n\nI found all this out when I dropped off the car. I talked to the manager, who was obnoxious and unhelpful - she basically asked if I could read. I called the 800 # twice and got even more discourteous service. (They never responded to an email I sent shortly after the incident.)\n\nHertz succeeded in ripping me off for an extra $100 or so. But they've lost my business for good.\n\nDon't get scammed like I did. Avoid Hertz and go with a reputable company instead."
0,"The car was nice, the service was terrible. Can I give zero stars?"
0,"Worst Hertz location experience I have ever had.  The car I reserved was not in my Gold space so I went inside.  They told me the class of car I reserved was in the space but would get me the actual car I reserved, a small SUV.  I waited 20 minutes for the right car.  While waiting the manager asked me if I was okay with a Suburban.  I said yes and he said it would cost more.  I told him I was a President's Circle member and entitled to a free upgrade.  He said no to free upgrade.\n\nUpon return there was no employee outside to check us in, although there were 3 employees standing in the return area."
0,"I am a President's Club member, arrived to a dirty Mini-Van! Really?  The NeverLost in the car did not work (no sound). They didn't seem to care. Exactly :)???"
0,"The worst Hertz location I've dealt with! The shuttle driver did not offer to help me or my colleague with our bags, instead he and another Hertz employee just chatted up a storm and did not even recognize our presence.  It was 6am and we both had golf bags and large carry-on baggage. I am a Hertz Gold Club member but my car was not waiting when we arrived. So I had to talk to an agent inside to get my car. They had me assigned to the wrong level of car so they offered me an upgrade, yet charged me for an upgrade, ok fine. This process took about 40 minutes. Each other person in my company had wait times of over an hour each! \nWhen we returned the car there was no one there to help check us in. When someone finally showed to check in the car, he turned around and walked away without helping us! We had to track him down. Again no one offered to help with the bags. Finally got the shuttle back to the airport, again no one offered to help with the bags. driver did not ask anyone on the shuttle what airline we were flying on and dropped us off at baggage claim! Worst service ever!"
0,"I got there at midnight to pick up my rental and the entrance was gated... After checking to make sure we weren't missing another possible entrance, we drove up to the exit and the pleasant employee informed me that they close the gate at midnight and everyone has to come in through this way... You know what would have been nice?  A sign that says that on the closed gate!  Something with a nice, little arrow that says, \""Hey, we're still open, just go right down here.\""  Is that hard?  I guess so.\n\nInside, the woman working at the counter was nice... She had me completely finished in about 10 minutes and I headed out to the car... It was a 2013 White Dodge Dart... I took a nice lap around the outside to make sure there weren't any dings or anything and went off into the night... I heard a weird ping sound while I was driving a few minutes in, but it was directly behind me, so I figured I would just check it out when I got home since we live pretty close to the airport... Ladies and gentlemen, I got home and checked the backseat of my rental car to find an empty bottle of Great Lakes' delicious Commodore Perry IPA!  Look, I understand that it's a delicious beer... I love beer almost any time, but you know when I don't love it?  When it's in my rental car, rolling around in the backseat with a fricking open container charge attached to it! What the H?! Upon contacting them the next day (because the manager wasn't onsite), I found out that the manager would \""talk to the employee\"" that cleans the cars, but they would accommodate me when I returned... \n\nThe car worked fine for the trip and it was time to return it... We pulled into the bay... We cleaned the interior and unpacked the luggage, but still hadn't seen a person to check us in... After about 10 minutes, I spotted two employees standing by a door, doing nothing... As I walked by them, they walked into the bay of cars, but only pressed on the hoods of them for some reason and just leisurely walked on to the next... Once I got to the front of the bay, I noticed a small sign that didn't even reach past the height of the hood of the car it was in front of ... It said that they do not have people to check in their cars... You have to leave the keys in the ignition, write down the mileage and check in the car inside... So no inspection upon return, guys?  I'm just supposed to trust that you won't run up some random charge on my card for damage or what not?  Really? \n\nInside was a straight up flustercluck... There is no other way to describe it... About 15 people waiting in line for TWO attendants and one of them ended up being tied up by one lady from France who didn't know she needed a $200 hold on her card... Apparently her boyfriend rented the car for her, but she doesn't have any more money and he won't go to the bank to put more money in the account... But she doesn't understand because this is a once in a lifetime thing and he never does anything for her and she needs him to leave where he is and go to the bank...  But he doesn't... At least not for the half hour I was in line to return this stupid car... The employee listened to her calmly and explained her options, so he gets points for that, at least... Then I noticed two other people come out of the back, walk through the area we were in and head outside... One of them was very clearly identified as a manager... How in the H do you miss a loudly complaining customer and about 15 other people with extremely unhappy looks on their faces packed into your lobby if you're in charge of something?  Oh, I know... You just don't give a f***... That's how.\n\nUgh.  Look, if you want to be open 24 hours, then you need to have enough employees on staff to make that happen as smoothly as possible... Otherwise, just close down and leave that for people that understand that good customer service doesn't only happen during traditional business hours! Oh! And my accommodation made for my possible arrest?  A 10% off coupon for another rental... Let me tell you where you can put that... On my next trip out of town, I will be renting a horse and leaving days ahead of schedule..."

0,"Never again.\n\nLines are terribly long, mostly due to slow, incompetent counter employees working with no sense of urgency.  Requested car seats but got to the car and no car seats were to be found.  Took over 30 minutes of screaming and threatening employees to finally get someone to bring them out.  Car seats were dirty and old.  Employee had tried to clean them but essentially just got them all wet, forcing our kids to sit on towels in the car seats.  Belts were all mangled requiring both seats to be fully taken apart and put back together.  And know this -- Hertz provides no assistance with car seats -- something that should have been made clear at the time of the reservation.  All in all, it took well over an hour to get out of the parking lot, which happens to be designed so that no traffic can easily get in or out, especially at busy times.  And to think Hertz actually charges MORE than most of their competitors.\n\nHertz was once a great company.  But every interaction I've had with them in the last 5 years has steadily shown them going downhill.  Well, guess what Hertz?  You finally hit bottom. I will never ever do business with you again."
0,"They have the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Never again will I rent from them. When I needed to turn the car in an hour early in order to get to my flight on time, they pretty much said tough luck. I was transferred to three different period to get the same response. Don't waste your money."
0,"What a disaster -- so bad it Hurts. \n\nHertz ruined a birthday surprise that friends lined up for me, after I flew into town and wound up, they checked with the airline to confirm the arrival time, and I subsequently got stranded in the Hertz office...such an unnecessary delay. \n\nAll they had to do was tell me when I called, and then had a second chance to when I arrived at the counter, that they were overbooked and that there delays of more than an hour and a half. Had they been responsible and courteous, I would have taken to another car rental agency and thought well of them....but I guess my money was too important to them. \n\nBut I'll tell you what they didn't use all that money from their over-bookings for...for someone to run the place responsibly. I thought the splattering of water drops as I was coming through the door was bad -- but you had to see the torrent of water gushing down from the roof next to where people were boarding the bus back to the terminal. The ineptness of the management of the place bordered on comical.\n\nNot only were people being showered-on while bordering the bus, with nobody around to care or fix the gushing water, but the bus drivers weren't smart enough to scoot up the pick-up point 15 feet so people wouldn't get wet -- and no manager was around to think for them and move the pick-up point to a drier spot. I have videos of this farce.\n\nI was referred to Hertz by Marriott by a call transfer when I booked the hotel at the airport...and unless Marriott wants to risk being guilty by association, they better run away from these jokers until they figure out how to manage, think and behave responsibly, even when they're busy and making lots of bookings (and revenues) -- and to have more respect for the time and needs of their clients."

0,I had a Gold reservation but arrived to find my name was not on the board. I waited in line with a dozen other livid Gold members and was then offfered a mini-van or to pay extra for an upgrade. If I gould give Hertz a zero I would.
0,"Bad service, bad cars, not recommended. Three sleepy mumbling representatives behind the counter and an exceedingly long line that is not moving. Finally I get a car whose wheels go cloink-clink-clunk so I didn't dare to go anywhere with it. I exchange it for a car that has no functioning outlet so I can't even use my GPS. Total failure."
0,"It's been a few weeks now since my trip from my house on Cape Cod to my niece's wonderful wedding in Greenville SC.  The trip is basically three legs : 1) bus Logan Airport, Boston (approx. 90 min.) 2) plane to Charlotte SC (3 1/2 hrs including early arrival at Logan) and 3) rental car to Greenville (1 1/2 hrs).  Little did I know that there would be fourth leg: picking up my previously reserved rental car at Hertz (1 hr.).  The next person they hire their that knows what's going on will be the first."
0,"Like the previous reviewers, if you are in a hurry, don't rent here. 45min wait time. The jerk \""Larry\"" behind the desk as identified in other reviews runs this place like a concentration camp. Instead of being apologetic, he reprimands people for coming up to the counter before they're ready. AVOID!!"
0,"Flights we're canceled so I needed to drive 8 hours home. Upon return, there was NO ONE there ready for my return. The attendants were in their small stations and would not scan my vehicle. They told me to go to the main office counter. When I got there, the line was out the door with people waiting to make reservations! I just needed to return! The line was barely moving! It was late, I was tired and, though there were employees in the lot, not a single one would take two minutes to scan and print a receipt for one return. 45 minutes later I was able to return my vehicle. I've never had this issue with any other rental company and I will NEVER use Hertz again."
0,"It Hurtz Horrible. Two painful experiences in a month. On my first  the front desk persons were slow, unfriendly and grumpy. Car was filthy and when I pointed this out and requested a clean cat they offered me an upgrade for a fee. I returned car and left two phone/lap top chargers in car charger. They have not been turned over to lost and found so the staff is stealing. My second trip reaffirmed that the staff was not just having a bad day but that were bad everyday. On my return I was hurrying and did not refill gas. Drove locally around Charlotte for two days and used about 1/4 tank. I was charged $115 for a full tank and service. The mileage recorded is EXAXTLY 200 miles indicating that the just guessed an amount. HurtZ claim I returned the car completely empty but has no record or the inspection sheet. So I thought I would be helpful and do the customer survey on the hertz web site. But I needed a 5 or 7 digit access code. Three reps gave me codes that did not work. I asked the third to hold while I tried the code and he said I should call back if it did not work. http://www.hertzsurvey.com/  My exp with Hertz has been very good over many years but at Charlotte Douglas airport I will use another company, next time. One Love"
0,It is the busiest holiday week of the year and they have one man working and two broken kiosks. 1 hour wait. I would do half a star if possible.
0,"Horrible treatment. The worst management team ever. They are not interested in helping with your situation at all, they have your money and dont care what condition the vehicle is in and whether or not your experience with the vehicle was good or bad. Unfortunately, until people read the reviews and stop renting from them and impact their finances this bad service and behavior will continue.I will have to say the gentleman at the return line was the only person who tried to help. Their vehicles are dirty and smelly. Word to the wise, choose another company if at all possible."
0,"45 minute wait for a car I reserved a month ago??? Ridiculous.  The staff seemed unsympathetic to everyone.  In addition, there is a lot full of cars for club gold members.   Never again will I rent from this Hertz."
0,"I rent from Hertz every week and have been a Presidential Circle member for several years.  I have probably rented from over a 100 different Hertz locations.  This one is by-far the WORST.....EVER! \n\nThe shuttle is super slow and with one shuttle running, the wait feels like an eternity.  The shuttle driver just sits there and does not help in anyway.\n\nEven with a Gold Reservation booked far in advance, don't be surprised if your name is not on the Gold Board.  When I was there, there were at least 20 Gold Members whose car was either not in the stall in the indicated stall or their name was not list on the board.  The lady working the Gold Counter was SUPER RUDE and acted if she was being bothered if anyone tried to ask her questions.  She was basically a service agent at the Gold Counter who did not want to be bothered.  \n\nI had an issue with my driver license.  So the SUPER RUDE gold counter lady called over the supervisor.  I had lost my driver license so he tried to explain to me why he could not rent me a car.  He thought he could, so he called someone else to clear it.  I asked if I can speak with the person he spoke to on the phone and i was told \""NO\"" since he if off the clock.  He tells me that he can call him but a customer cannot since he is off the clock.  While this is going on, the SUPER RUDE gold counter lady starts blurting out State Laws which she claims prevents Hertz from renting me a car; most of her \""facts\"" were total fairy tales.\n\nI will never rent form this Hertz again.  If I am back in Charlotte for any reason, I will forgo my Gold Hertz status and rent from either Avis or National.  Actually, if Avis or National offers me instant status (Gold equivalent), I would jump ship immediately."
0,"Very, very slow service. Inadequate staffing for the volume of customers and nobody seems in a hurry to help. Find another rental car service at Charlotte airport."
0,"Lousy scratched up car. 20k miles on it. No USB port. But it was clean and ran well. \n\nThe shuttle back to the airport was hilariously bad.  The guy sat I'm the lot empty for 10 mins, them proceeded to wait until he was sardine full before he left event though two other shuttles were there. Traffic was horrible and he inched along. A guy pleaded to get off and walk due to tight schedule but he refused. Twice."
0,"This service really sucks. Reservations are not honored even if prepaid. Only highly \""upgraded\"" cars are available. \nAs I sit here four over an hour I know I will NEVER use hertz again."
0,"The worst service and slowest employees I've ever seen. Tons of Hertz reps lurking around, line keeps on getting bigger & bigger - no one even bothers to consider opening another counter. Its an embarassing service. I would give it zero stars if I could."
0,"****Watch Your Pennies, and Your Dollars***\n\nReserved a standard car w / no upgrades and unlimited mileage for a trip. Prior to reserving, I joined Hertz gold plus rewards to get any additional discount available. Arrived at hertz, lobby was packed. A woman walked along side the line and asked were there any gold plus members. Of course I said yes. She informed me that I didn't have to stand at the back of this line, I could go to the gold plus member location. So off I go. Walk into the booth, sales person asked my name and said you can pick up your car at at #'d stall. That was easy!\nGet to the car, it looked fine as far as I was concerned. I get to exit booth where they electronically scan your vehicle before leaving lot. At this point the attendant asked if I want to prepay for gas. Not being a frequent renter of cars, I ask...How does that benefit me? She says that when I get back, \""We will fill the tank up at a rate of $3.11\"", which is cheaper than the street. I agree. There's no price quote before they run my card. I get a long folded receipt, my mistake was in not trying to hold up the line, knowing what my daily rate was, I didn't look at it. I get home and look at the receipt...WAIT A MINUTE!!\nI was charged for a vehicle upgrade, SiriusXM radio and $60 bucks for gas prepay. \nI call the Hertz center where I got the car from, explain to them what the discrepancy was. \nThis  \""CHICK\"" on the phone says \""well why did you leave if it was wrong?\""\nI try to explain to this \""BIRD\"" that I reserved what I thought was a Nissan Altima, Or comparable car, a standard vehicle. I received a Chevy Malibu which as far as I am concerned was a standard vehicle. It doesn't list anywhere on the vehicle what class it's considered nor does it list upgraded features. On top of that, you don't get the detailed billing statement until you're two(2) tires off the lot!! \nShe ask me to hold, I get transferred to their corporate office. The individual says she doesn't know why they transferred me there but she will have the supervisor from the location call me. I wait about an hour, then drive back to Hertz. I explain again!! I was very clear in what was wrong. The attendant says \""well, the system says this is what it is\"". I tell him that I don't care what your system says. I have an emailed confirmation with all the terms I agreed to. He asks to see email. I show him and he says o.k. Makes changes to the system and gives me another long folded receipt. I go through it and I see he did take off for the SiriusXM radio but not the vehicle upgrade. I approach again and explain that my confirmation was at a very specific daily rate for a standard car. He asks to see email again and says well you have a full size car which is more $$. I say \""then give me the standard vehicle at the rate I originally agreed to\"". Needless to say, I kept the same car at the lower rate. This was more of a pain in the butt than I care to write.\n\n   Upon returning the car, just knowing that the tank was about $15 - $20 bucks shy of being filled that I would get the difference back @ a rate of $3.11 per gallon.\n Wrong again!! Now I was explained the add'l $60 deposit differently, Now it is for the convenience of them filling it up, no matter where the tank was. When I questioned it, the attendant starts talking about.. because you went over 100 miles a day, so forth, and so on, just jargon! I explain that I had unlimited mileage. I get more jargon.\n\n  It cost me an add'l $60 bucks for the \""Gas Tank Riddle\"" when I could have filled it up just outside the airport for no more than $20 bucks. This is after the hurdles I already had to jump through to get the price I was originally quoted.\n\n  Overall, it was not a good experience!! After reserving at a specific daily rate, I was left feeling like I just played poker at the casino... and only my money was on the table."
0,"Stay away. The whole experience was terrible.\n\nI was shown to a phone kiosik to check in with an agent through a video-conference. That was not ideal. Do I want to hold an old school phone to my ear while trying to find reservation documents, holding my license up to the camera, etc? Disaster! I felt like I was visiting grand-ma at the penitentiary.\n\nThen I was set up in a car with nearly 60,000 miles? For what I paid, I expect something with under 10,000 miles."
0,"So far...not so good. We are waiting in the lobby with 20+ other renters. We've been here 30 min, and those finally getting cars have been waiting 2hrs. I use Yelp all the time, and this was the one time i didn't check a place out before paying for a rental...huge mistake! Look at other rental locations reviews, they are much better!!!"
0,"Terrible service, long lines, broken kiosks. Go with another rental car at CLT it will be well worth your time and money to avoid this sh*t show. I had a deadline departure time to be in my car. I figured an hour was plenty of time to catch the shuttle and pick up my car. Nope...incompetence reigns supreme. Shouldn't expect more from this GLOBAL rental company. Sheesh...ok I'm done complaining now. Be a gold member so you don't waste any more time."
0,The worst place to rent a car from !! They have no cars . Must wait almost 2 hours for a car and they don't care ! Stay away
0,"This is the first time ever I wrote a bad review but I am just that frustrated with Hertz CLT.  I was nodding my head on all the negative reviews on Hertz CLT location cause that is my personal experience also.  I am a Gold Circle member but apparently it makes no difference at this location.  I got on-time Carfirmation once out of five rentals in Sept  and your name is not on the board either.  It is true the lines are super long and not unusual to wait in line at least for 20 mins or more even if you are a Gold Circle member and that you had reserved the car properly.  It is also embarrassing to drive a car to the client site, of which has dents and scratches all over.  One time the car they gave me has 67,000 miles on it and the Hertz employee wrote on the paper dents and scratches all over because there were so many.   Most of the counter employees are rude or cold and not helpful.  I asked why I don't get Carfirmation or find my name on the board, the lady just rolled her eyes and there was no apology.  It is also true you always have to wait for the shuttle.  I would see two Avis shuttle come and go and 10 or 15 mins later I will see the Hertz shuttle.  I have also completed survey and sent in complaints to Hertz but nothing has changed.  The only reason I have not switched is because of good services received at other cities and my assignment in Charlotte ends in Dec and I don't have to deal with Hertz CLT any more.\nRichard... Thanks for your response.  RR 543397190 has miles out 66,900 (9/21/14) and miles in at 67,054 (9/27)"
0,Quite possibly the SLOWEST moving place on earth. Took over 30 mins to get a car. \n\nWait line is slow and long to get keys and then super long wait for car to be pulled up. \n\nDoesn't this place know that every other rental place is more efficient?\n\nAvoid this one if you can.
0,"Do not rent here.  Bait and switch.  Book a car at a rate and then they give you a smaller car, which shoild be at lower rate, at the same higher rate originally booked.  No wonder they only hsve a 1 star rating.  So much for being #1.  Guess they've gottrn to big and are full of themselves.  Don't bother asking for management.  They are worthless and could care less about delivering a quality customer experience."
0,"Showed up in NC for a business meeting.  The National shuttle driver was very nice and helpful.  As soon as we got off the shuttle things turned unorganized.  People wondering around the lot to pick out their cars.....and many employees standing around smiling ....okay fine.  \n\nWe picked out our car, which I admit is a nice feature of national.  We drove to the exit where there are 3 lanes....all three open....NONE of them moving.  Two lanes sat idle for 5 minutes......idle as in standing still.  Employees still standing around the lot smiling got to be a bit annoying when it was not clear what was going on.\n\nWhen we finally arrived at the booth to get checked out the lady seemed a bit delirious and confused.  She would ask us questions that were what we should be asking her.\n\nI rent a car roughly once-per-month and have never run into a facility as poorly run as this...."
0,"DO NOT BOOK A RENTAL CAR THROUGH NATIONAL. \n\nOur shuttle driver Terry was fantastic & friendly, then we arrived at the lot!\n\nOur reservation was made through the employer. I would never have chosed National Car Rental. THE worst I have ever experienced. I normally book with Enterprise, Hertz, and Avis. Or just reserve a town car. The counter personnel assured my husband it was no problem to change the reservation. Then handed him the contract stating our daily rate was $68! For three days in a compact car, going 5 miles? Why on earth would anyone pay that kind of money? \n\nLet's try this again...back at the counter--Could not get a straight answer from Rehab (really, her name was Rehab??) Asked to cancel the original reservation (since the staff wouldn't dare suggest this) and start over with a new reservation with the lowest rate possible. \n\nRehab was impossible to work with, didn't make eye contact, and refused to ask the questions she should to get us out of there fast. She actually stood there staring at the computer screen until I asked her a question or made a statement. If you don't like your job, quit. Maybe there's a data entry job you can do somewhere that doesn't require dealing with customers. That would be well-suited to you.\n\nWith the DNC in town, the lot was almost empty so even with the compact price, we had to choose a larger car. Score, but the hour we took to get there was not worth it. NEVER AGAIN, NATIONAL."
0,"Nice selection of cars, pretty good pick-up/ drop-off and some great staff but BEWARE of one of the ladies on front desk which can take away all the good in a sec. She will try to squeeze as much money to give you a car of your choice. If you are using corporate rate, she will try her hardest not to honor any of the decent upgrade options or even make it impossible by dis-allowing certain cars from the category you are trying to upgrade! With what authority I don't know!!!\n\nAgain it is only one & I won't hesitate to steer clear next time after the 3rd consecutive experience. And sorry won't take the name so can't help much there but here is some advice: Do not hesitate to call the manager if you encounter similar experience.  She might even lie that the manager just left for the day but obviously somebody is in charge every time and mostly more responsible so highly likely you will be heard. No other reason this facility will deserve anything less than 4 stars."
0,I've heard of supply demand but this place truly capitalized on other rental car companies in airport being unavailable.  $600 for 4 day rental of a ridiculous Mustang!  I took for the day then reserved a vehicle with Avis the next day.\n\nEnterprise also doesn't have a preferred program worthwhile...\n\nI'll stay with Avis and now I know why Time Warner doesn't use them as a corporate provider.
0,"Enterprise. First time because AMEX for whatever reason didn't book National this time. They even told me it was the same company which is clearly not the case.\n\nArriving, the guy propose me all the insurance that I have to take. It increases the price of the renting by 3... (400$ to +1200$) So from cheap prices AMEX told me, I got a 3 times higher bill now.\n\nNot that I am not aware of this kind of situation but in the case of Enterprise, there will be a difference when you arrive to the car. National use to give for the same price a middle to full car size. Enterprise will just give you a small car you \""asked\"" for for the small price which is now with the insurance a full size car price.\n\nWe also wanted to change the credit card used to pay. Call Enterprise desk put on hold forever. Send an e-mail to the leasing agent that gave me his card, never got an answer.\n\nThe car didn't have any problem. Only positive thing.\n\nSo for resume:\nFor the National price, you get at Enterprise a small car with no people willing to help you once you swiped your credit card."
0,Worse check-in system yet encountered in my travels.   About a 20+ minute wait after checking-in at the counter.   Will not go here again.
0,"At the end of July I contacted the 800 reservation line at Alamo to make plans for a car rental from August 6-August 13 at the Charlotte airport location. I was going to be using my Hilton Honors points to secure this car, and was told by Hilton that BEFORE I took points from my bank to make sure that this location accepted points as payment, as some locations do not, and to make sure there were no blackout days. your 800 reservations team told me to contact the airport location to confirm that they would accept pmt with points, which I did, and was told there are no blackout days for this program. They said go ahead and retrieve your code necessary from hilton and call us back to reserve. \n\nI got the necessary code from Hilton the following Monday and called the 800 #, but was told to call the location to secure thew reservation since I would be using points. I then called Charlotte lonely to be told they don't make reservations there, call the 800 # again.....\nSo I called back to the reservation line and was told that while Charlotte accepts the points program and there are no blackout days, they had reached the limit of the # of reservations allowable under that program for the day and would not make my reservation. They sent me to an escalation dept where I takes to a gentleman named Norman.  He was pleasant, but of no use..... He said he wild pass my info to a supervisor and ask that they call.  I waited.....\nI called corporate in St. Louis and asked for someone that could assist me, only to get \""Norman\"" again. He said I had to wait for a call. No one else would help me.    A few days later I get a rude call from Angie at the Charlotte location - she left a voice mail that said she can't help me, call the reservation line.  So once again I called the 800# ad  spoke to a very nice girl, maybe Lakresha??  African American girl that was the most pleasant person to work with. She tried everything she cod to get me a car close to the dates I needed, with my points , but to no avail.  \n\nSo I ended up paying for a rental, $240.00 that had not been budgeted for, and I've lost 70,000 points with Hilton and got NOTHING for it but a disgusting run around from Alamo. \n\nI fell was dealt with very unfairly and not given the true restrictions behind using Alamo for my rental. I confirmed no black out days and then given the surprise \""But......\nI would never have risked this transaction had I been told that a rental may still not be possible.   \nAfter emailing customer service and getting an incident number assigned to me I was told:\n\n\"" I completely understand your frustration. I have document this email thoroughly and will do my best to get you the resolution you deserve. I have also forwarded this email and your contact information directly to the Regional Customer Service Department for Charlotte. They will reach out to you within the next 3-5 days. Your Incident ID number regarding this issue is: 20521478. again I apologize for the inconvenience this has cause you. If you have any additional questions, comments or concerns please feel free to reach out to me and I will aid you in any way I possibly can.\""\n\nWell, weeks later I have no phone call, and more emails that blame me for not booking far enough in advance, missing the entire problem of their sales people not stating the policy, IN FULL, for renting a vehicle using Hilton Honors points. \n\nNever EVER again. Stay away from this group of companies."
0,The chicken wings are great. Everything else was ugh. I had the shrimp with broccoli which by the way was mostly broccoli and the rice tasted like pool water. Never again!!
0,"This place used to be good. It is convenient to me and while not great, it at least, was decent Chinese take-out. Well I don;t know what happened but it is certainly no longer decent. We ordered dumplings, chicken wings, crab rangoon, spring roll, egg roll, orange beef, and hot and sour soup. Nothing was good. It all had a funny taste, nothing was cooked right, the orange beef was soggy, gummy and tasted bad, egg rolls were soggy and had a strange cinnamon sweet kind of taste, Spring roll was terrible, hot and sour soup was neither, and the crab rangoon was limp Nothing had much flavor and the flavor that did exist .was just weird. I don't know what happened to the chicken wings because they used to be great, now they are heavily battered in a tasteless thick soggy batter.  Needless to say we won;t be back and if you are smart you won't be either."
0,I ordered General Tso's chicken and beef fried rice and both were vastly sub-par. The chicken was tangy and had an off taste. The rice was soggy and the beef was over cooked.  Also it took a hour and a half for the food to show up and even the egg roll was only average. I will not be ordering from this place ever again and I would strongly tell anyone I know not to order from there either.
0,"I Must start with saying that I Can't Believe what has happened to this place! My father and I used to frequent WOK BO for years initially after them opening! The good \""WAS\"" great the service \""WAS\"" great and the quality was top notch. Over the past couple years they have been dwindling down Quality and Service have become BIG Issues! They have a man I apologize I can't remember his name a younger guy. Since he has been there They have lost all of our business! He is cocky and a complete smart A$$. My apologies but there is no other way to put it! He really could care less if you have or had a problem. He is nice upfront until an issue arises! We have received wrong partial orders and orders that have been half wrong half right when we ordered delivery recently trying to give wok BO another chance. After a \""FEW\"" wrong orders one evening I decided to call it back in. After The delivery took 45mins beyond what we were told initially I got nothing but attitude from the young man and was told that What I received is what I ordered. No it wasn't! Still had the paper that we write our orders on and called in with. After I was politely told by him that I must have thought we ordered the other stuff he says that they will send the driver back out but would be about an hour and asked for us to pay the 5.47 difference in price and return the other meal. Maybe it's just me but that's bad business! We had 3 people there to eat as I explained to him and now for everyone to eat together there food would be cold as well as the inconvenience. This happened several times recently as I have said but the COMPLETE ATTITUDE this young man always has when there is a problem makes thus past Friday my last meal from them. Mrs. Nancy and her husband(Assuming they are still the owners) that owned wok Bo are great people I only hope that they see how detrimental to the business this guy is before its to late! I would live to have the old wok-Bo back it was by far a favorite but my business will not return until this young man is gone! Many others I know have had the same sorts if problems with him and will not return either. So much for an 8+ years of being a customer!"
0,This place is horrible!  The ONLY reason we order from them is because they deliver.  Most of the time we tolerate their food if for the grace of god they get our order correct.  2 out of the last 3 times we've ordered they have screwed up our order.  It takes them normally over an hour to get our food to us.  The most recent horrible experience I order the Shrimp Chow Mein.  My order came without the crunchy noodles.  So all i had was a pile of lettuce soaked in some liquid with shrimp.  I called and complained and the lady that answered said the next time I ordered she would give me an extra bag of crunchy noodles.  I told her I might not order this again next time.  Then she offered a free drink.  We don't go there in person we only order.  I wasn't going to take a free coke for them messing up my order.  I told her how about you knock $5 off our next order.  The lady refused.  Don't waste your time.  They don't care how crappy their service is.  Take the extra time and drive to Red Bowl or a better restaurant.  I'd give them 0 stars if I could.
0,Horrible customer service and when I talked to the manager she apologized but you can tell she didn't care.

And the front desk lady got offended and babbled something under her breath. Thankfully I didn't have my big heavy luggage or I would've been pissed having to carry it up the stairs...regardless, I feel piss for the people that did have to carry theirs. \n\nSecondly, this place stinks and everything looks nasty!! I have never stayed at a hotel that looks so run down and overall dirty. The carpet feels so yucky but I didn't bring my flip flops. Ugh! \n\nHonestly, if they weren't running a special, I wouldn't have stayed here. I'll suck it up since we're only staying a few hours, but I definitely will take a long hot bath to wash off the stench before I leave!"
0,"DRAT.  I booked this three star hotel via hotwire Im not an expert on the 5 star rating scale, but I thought too highly of a three star rating. Not clean, all kinds of shiz on the hallway floors, Ex. sunflower seeds, paper, in the corners you can see dirt & debre build up.  The main lobby is promising, to suck you in, but the plaster in the walls is cracked, room doors have been painted over 755778738688796 times.  My big window looks like someone stuck their big nasty greesy forehead and smeared it throughly.  Their was a big private hair atop my toilet paper roll.  \n\nOn Hotwire I got this room for $68 if you were to walk in the rate is $99.  So thank goodness I got it for the cheaper price!  Better than my last hotel stay @ La Quinta but still gross"
0,"The place reminds me a lot of my freshman dorm. Peeling walls, fluorescent lighting flickering in the elevator and strange humid smells. Although my bed and bathroom were pretty clean, and the staff were really great, the hotel itself is pretty old and resembles a trucker motel. Way overpriced for what it is."
0,"This hotel is stuck in the middle of nowhere. \n\nThe restaurant staff is relatively friendly, but the space/decor is \""budget\"" at best.\n\nWe had several problems with the Receptionists. Problems include: not being able to book a taxi, problems over room check-in/double booking a our room, and being rude over the phone.\n\nAlso, our Damn Room Key would never work!?! I had to walk up and down every time to get it to work again..\n\nMy best advice, pay a little extra money and book a hotel in Uptown Charlotte. This place doesn't deserve the business."
0,Nice staff.Dirty. There was fecal matter on my shower curtin. Cleanliness is not a priority here.  Hotwire is the reason for all my problems. I will never do name your own price.
0,"Ordered take out which consisted of sesame chicken, cashew chicken and crab ragoons. Were were told 20 minutes for pick up and we waited an additional 15 minutes at the restaurant when we went to pick up.

0,"We have tried this place two times. Food was decent at best the first time for dinner. The second time we walked out before our meal even started due to the dry burnt food on the buffet and rude service.

0,staff is friendly enough..drs are quick and dont really listen or ask any questions... ive changed drs since my last visit and am very happy. i had an appt that i had rescheduled here and they keep sending and will not stop sending a letter asking me to pay for a missed visit when i called to cancel a week before. found a way better dr...little better to drive but at least i feel like im getting the customer service i deserve...
0,"In the time I've been living on the road I have never had a worse experience.  Bad service, rude desk clerks, terrible management!  Waiting outside our doors at 9 am to get out when checkout is 11.  I would not suggest this hotel to anyone staying in the Charlotte area!"
0,I was NOT impressed! The service was good...that's about it. The chicken sandwhich tasted like it had been left out a while before it was cooked...definitely not fresh!\nTheir mashed potatos were good although they served it with sausage gravy which was unique. \nThe cost was ok. Typical chicken place. The (women's) restroom wasn't cleaned very well and neither was the restaurant. Trying to find a clean table was not hard... only one amongst several messy tables. \nThe only plus to the restaurant was the servers. They had smiles and treated us well. \nIt was the first Bojangles I've been to and I was not impressed in the least.
0,"I hate to be negative. But not good at all. The worse I have had in a long time. The chicken had some weird batter on it, the egg foo young gravy was off tasting, and I'm not sure what type of meat was in the wontons. Just trying to be helpful"
0,HORRIBLE over fried unrecognizable meat in hard batter. Rice is reheated.
0,I wouldn't eat here if it were the last food place in Charlotte. They have burnt broccoli. They also have a lack of good customer service. Oh not to mention how slow they are when you are waiting for your order. Don't waste your time!
0,"meat was not smoked, cooked way too long, so it was basically tasteless mush, sides had little to no flavor.  place was empty, cafeteria feeling, no music, no cheer, just blah...."
0,"Called for delivery and was told they were closed though Yelp said they were open. Either they're wrong or Yelp is, in either case not the way to run a business."
0,"The service was nice, friendly and fast.\n\nI'm giving it a 1 star for the food and price. It literally tasted and looked like everything came out of a old can. The consistency was real weird on every level. Probably the worst BBQ food I've ever had. I don't know how else to put it. But if you can avoid it, you should.\n\nIt was real expensive for the quality of food too. It was $18 for a standard pulled pork plate with a drink. \n\nSeriously so bad. But they were friendly and nice. That's about it though. \n\nSorry bubba, you need a makeover. You're giving NC BBQ a bad rep."
0,"Wow. Just was refused service because we had a large group. When we offered to break up and just sit with the family. Nope....not an option. Empty restaurant, and they would not let 18 people sit and eat. Their policy  is \"" no teams\"".  We had 6 high school girls and 12 parents.  The hostess politely  said they have had teams cause problems.  Well, this policy just cost them. None of these 12 parents will ever return. So I can't tell you how the food is. Just don't walk in as a large group. That is my tip."
0,"Didn't mind the high price! Dropped my vehicle off a week ago and am still waiting. Every time I call it's 30 more minutes.\n Will not be going back for any service. Even though I was referred by a friend of the owner, I never let them know that. \n Your experience will be like this! You walk in and they may be talking amongst themselves to figure out who is gonna help you. After a few minutes they'll ask what you need. If your lucky and it's a minor issue (check the air in my tire) you'll be out the door in no time. Anything else good luck and be prepared to rent a vehicle for a few days to a few weeks!!!!"
0,This McDonald's has the slowest staff I have EVER seen. Absolutely pathetic!
0,Unfortunately I found this hotel to be more like a motel. The room that I stayed in was so filthy and the odor was so grand I had to move to another room. The pool was dirty to the point the staff advised me not to let the kids swim until they had it cleaned. The housecleaning staff took it upon themselves to help steal my 7 yr.old daughter Kindle Fire after I left it in the room. And the hotel manager then advised me he did not appreciate the fact I contacted corporate. He also told me after several attempts to get this matter resolved that he did not appreciate me for slandering his hotel. I had to file a police report
0,Stopped here on the way to Fort Jackson.  It's not in a great neighborhood & right off of the freeway so it's noisy. The staff was really friendly but the rooms were dirty. The shower looked like the showers in RV's.  we were supposed to stay for three days but after we saw people having relations in the pool at noon we decided it wasn't the safest place to be. The staff was very understanding about canceling our stay. I wouldn't recommend this place.
0,WOW this place is a complete dive I don't even no where to start. Ok our hotel room smelled of marijuana and a bathroom cleaner combo. Then learned the bathroom door was a slider. Yup no door knob a hole for a finger slot. So when your in the bathroom you can watch tv. Not my type of place the shower is like an RV camper the neighborhood is terrible tour next to a Waffle House and jack in the box I put the ac on smelled like burning hair  I heard Police and fire truck sirens All night very noisy the next-door neighbor was either living there or been there along time tons of people coming and going must of been dealing drugs then breakfast was a joke hot pockets and water down waffles SMH shameful the lady stood there while we are preparing our food like a security guard overlooking everything making sure u didn't take two unsoft butter overall I would never recommend this
0,"Don't waste your time. Overpriced low quality hibachi. You can tell from the moment you walk in (cardboard handwritten signs screaming no return/ not responsible for food issues) that maybe you should turn around and leave. I however made the mistake of staying. I purchased the beef teriyaki combo (which was rung up wrong and had to be fixed after I waited for my food for 20 mins). The beef was over cooked and too lightly sauced, the rice was bland and carrots overcooked into mush. Not worth the stomach ache I had the rest of the day."
0,I didnt want to give them one star but didnt have a choice. Not good service at all went in on a saturday morning around 10 a.m got seated they didnt take our drink order just sat us with the menu. waited about 20 mins saw the waitress a couple of times never made eye contact with us then finally after 30 min of no drinks or any contact we got up and left manager was no where to be found.
0,"I visited Todd's Flowers in Plaza Midwood for two reasons:  \n1. To support a local business\n2. To get my wife a congratulatory bouquet for her new office.  \n\nAs soon as I walked through the door, I realized I was in a floral thrift store. I was greeted by a stark showroom filled with dusty baskets and props that looked like they belonged in a family photo studio circa 1981.  The two small refrigerators they did have only had 4 bouquets in them, and the flowers appeared old and wilted.  The employee pointed to the cooler at what I believed to be the \""Charlie Brown Christmas Tree\"" of floral arrangements and informed me the arrangements start at $45 and go up from there. \n\nThe employee did rise quickly to greet me, she asked if I needed help.  I inquired about delivery, and they do deliver, which is nice.  She was more than willing to help me out, but the combination of a boring showroom, shabby product and high prices just left me standing there staring at the employee.  I couldn't even make up a lie as to why I needed to leave, I just blurted out \""I'm going to try somewhere else\"" and turned and walked out.\n\nI ended up going to an unnamed local grocery store in Charlotte and a florist working in the smallest little corner of the store made me a really large arrangement with fall colors for around $35.  This was definitely a case where I wanted to support local business but the product they offered completely underwhelmed me.  \n\nTodd's Flowers has a good location with some really nice Elizabeth homes nearby, but they need to work on the customer experience, and they need to have someone cranking out beautiful arrangements that you can't find anywhere else in that area.  If they did that, you'll have to take a number to get in the door."
0,"Horrible service. Terrible showroom from 1980. Poor attitude by employee. $17 bucks for two balloons, which the employee self proclaimed he didn't know how to inflate with the helium tank. \n\nLet it fold so another small business can have the spot and contribute to the community."
0,"If I could give zero stars I would.  Waited almost a half hour for my number to be called to even be registered, but that never happened.  I ended up leaving and going to cvs clinic instead.  Won't ever go back there."
0,This is the worst Pizza Hut that I have ever ordered from. The pizza was cold and the sauce was nasty. The crust tasted like it had been sitting for days. The wings were sitting in pool of sauce and grease and the bone was red like it had been sitting in blood before it was cooked for a while. It was so nasty that I could not eat it because I thought I was going to get sick. I called the manager and her best idea was she could come and pick it up and reimburse me but it would be another hour or make me more. I will never order from there again and hope they get shut down.
0,This is the worst pizza store in Charlotte. I have ordered from this location three times and they have never gotten my order correct. Ever. As the other reviewers noted the management is horrible and rude. Don't waste your money.
0,This place is awful dont waste your money go somewhere else. delivery took almost two hours and pizza was cold. Not to mention my order was wrong. I used to work here many years ago i hate to see this franchise go down the toilet. DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE!!!!!!!!
0,"I only rated 1 star because I couldn't select a half or none.  Placed a delivery order at 5:30 and was told 30 minutes.  Called at 6:50 am was told it was on its way.  Called back again at 7:15 and it was not in the system anywhere and they have no record of it (after taking our credit card mind you).  \n\nWill never order from there again and suggest you use caution as well, especially if you have young kids."
0,"My wife and I came to Charlotte for a nice dinner at Barrington's but we were extremely disappointed especially with the service.  The food was good but my wife's duck was not prepared as she asked and when we were finally able to get the attention of our server she said that she put the order in for the duck to be medium taking no responsibility for how the duck was prepared and served.  I have had better service at the Waffle House.  In addition the wine was served by over filling the glasses so that she would not have properly attend to our table.   \n\nAttention to detail is what makes a good restaurant great.  Barrington's has a ways to go when it comes to service and attention to detail.  I do not recommend this restaurant if you want a great meal and with great  service as we had expected.   \n\nIn sum, the food would be good if prepared as asked but the service is well bellow what one would expect for a restaurant of this caliber."
0,I can't comment on the food because we never made it that far unfortunately. Me and husband had gotten a babysitter (4 kids) and was so looking forward to going out to a restaurant that we hadn't eaten at before but when we arrived a lady explained that we didn't have reservations. I told her that I had made reservations on their web site (not open table or the like--but their reservation web site) but hadn't recieved any confirmation or e-mail that they were booked. I had gotten a little concerned a couple days before because I hadn't heard anything so I went in again and commented that I'd like a phone call or e-mail to confirm or deny but nothing again so we showed up hoping it was okay---the place had 2 people sitting in it at 6pm (our reservation time) and she said that they couldn't accomodate--even though there was 20 some tables empty--we were very upset by the lack of service and understanding--we love to eat out and do it quite often but will never go here again---Ruth's Chris down the road was very accomodating and the food was delicious!!!
0,"we were so disappointed to not have eaten at your restaurant, .we have always been your biggest fans, spreading the word to who ever would listen. we had a reservation 6 days ago. we were seated at the 1/2 a table(2top) in the window. we were sandwiched between to parties and requested any other table or even the bar. manager never came back to tell us that all were reserved for others. what about our reservation? this table is not suitable for anyone., why don't you try it sometime? needless to say, we did not stay."
0,"Stopped by tonight with a friend. We both ordered bottled beers. My bottle came with a \""Best consumed before May 11, 2011\"". My friend's beer had a due date of November 8. I returned my beer and ordered a draft. The waiter did discount my order, but I was really disappointed in their quality control. Not sure if this was an isolated incident, but the whole experience left a bad taste."
0,"I am by far the biggest fan of Hickory Tavern's build your own salad. I literally could eat it every day. At this location,  however, simple instruction and ability to listen seem to be their biggest hurdle. \nI've called in to go orders, on multiple occasions, and they just can't seem to ever get it right. I don't know if it's the \""builder\"" or the person taking the order.  \nThe continued mistake has prevented me from calling these guys for the past couple of weeks but tonight I really wanted one of those salads and decided to give it a shot.  Friday night, super busy inside, go in, food is ready, get home, and BAM... It's wrong again. The roller coaster of emotion from excitement to disappointment to anger is the reason I'm writing today. $12.95 for a salad (with protein), when built by the customer, should be done correctly 100% of the time!"
0,"So bad compelled me to download yelp app and write review. Went for lunch with family (wife and 3 young boys). We've learned to not be picky as our crew can be a little rambunctious. First off in an empty restaurant we were seated directly next to the kitchen in/out door. Next the waitress spilled water on my wife and table. Then when asked what the specials were I was told \""um, not sure let me check\"". My food (turkey club) was eatable but my wife \""salad\"" consisted of brown lettuce. The kicker is that my boys (2 and 4) didn't eat their hotdogs because they tasty \""yucky\"". How can you mess up a hot dog????  Seems to be a good place to grab a beer and watch a game, just don't eat."
0,"This location is pretty much an accurate reflection of most of the MdDonalds in South Charlotte.. The associates are rude, the management is indifferent, the orders are wrong 80% of the time, and above all no one cares...  If you want the wrong order, old old coffee, and drive through people who are more interested in texting and talking to the guy in the back go to this location..."
0,"The associates are slow and rude. One time I ordered a bacon ranch salad with ranch dressing, got home, they gave me some north western I don't even know what it was crap. Go back ask politely for a packet of salad ranch dressing, because \""you gave me the wrong one I requested\"". She says \""what kind of dressing did we give you?\"" I said \""ma'am idk it was not ranch though\"" so she tries to give me ranch dipping sauce and the manager finally hands me the dressing I want. I just felt like I was being questioned. I do not need free packets of dressing, but I do want the kind I ordered. On several occasions before and after this incident I have experienced slow service, incorrect orders given to me, and extremely poor customer service. They should have people with some decency working there. I know it's McDonalds but as Si would say, good-NESS!"
0,"I typically wouldn't take the time to review a fast food chain but the overall experience was so terrible that my children wanted and insisted that I YELP about it.  When we walked in the door two of us almost busted our tails because of the wet and greasy floor.  There wasn't a caution sign indicating the floors might be slippery....definitely a lawsuit waiting to happen.  The service pretty much sucked.  The folks acted like they didn't want to be there and appeared bothered when we asked them for extras such as ketchup and hot sauce.  The guy in front of us left mad because they couldn't seem to get his order right.  As my son said their \""legendary sweet tea\"" wasn't very legendary.  It tasted old and not very sweet.  The fries were greasy and not hot (pet peeve of mine with french fries).  To top it off the place looked and smelled dirty.  Pretty unacceptable considering that it was dead in there.  Or maybe there's a reason for that...."
0,"I wish I had read the previous review first.  My boyfriend and I were craving a Cajun Chicken biscuit for breakfast so he picked it up and brought it home.  The chicken was so dry, hard and overcooked it was like chicken jerky & didn't even taste anything like it should.  We were so disappointed so he called to tell the manager and she didn't offer us a better one or anything free next time.  It was just a waste of $10 because we couldn't eat it.  They probably won't get my business again!"
0,"Absolutely the worst bar I've been to . After about 5 drinks I realized they purposely made their drinks extremely weak. I spent so much money and barely got tipsy. I told the bartender I was disappointed with my drinks and she literally screamed at me as I walked out of the door ( I still left her a good tip!) I will never ever go there again. Trashy, nasty and extremely rude staff. There was even a fight with some dude broke glass and almost hit us with it and there was no real bouncers- just a few people who worked there who barely stopped him from attacking us. Completely ruined my night-especially the rude bartenders."
0,"Went in the other day and it was my first time hearing that they were a private bar. I've been here about 5 other times through the year. I didn't want to sign any forms for membership that night, I just wasn't in the mood. As I was leaving the staff was kind enough to insult me with saying what kind of a person was I that I couldn't afford the membership. Well with attitude like that I won't ever consider spending my money here again. If the owners let the staff get away with this level of service then I suspect everything else is being neglected. I suggest you visit another bar before considering this place. There's plenty other spots with a lot friendlier staff in Charlotte."
0,"Went to Baileys about a week ago to celebrate my birthday with some friends. There were four of us and two of us got up from the table to use the restroom. When we came back my best friends iPhone was no longer on the table. In a panic, we are looking around the table and around us and looking at the people that were at the tables near us - it was no where to be found. Thanks to \""Find my iPhone\"" - the iPhone turned up in our waitresses back pocket. The manager came out and the waitress swore up and down that she had no idea how it got there. The manager let us know that she was going to let her go that night if the story stuck. The waitress got out of that one and still has her job somehow after trying to steal a customer's phone. \n\nHATE Bailey's. I can understand that a customer is not always right - but when a customer's phone ends up in the servers back pocket - some action needs to be taken.\n\nWill not be returning."
0,"Your staff is horrendous to say the least. I will be filing complaints to the BBB, health department, and whom ever will listen (or watch the videos). I have a Video of all of the following. Your bartender completely ignoring our party of two, as we are speaking directly too her, and her making us repeat ourselves 3 times and still didn't answer our question. I confronted her about her lack of attention and being disrespectful. She stated it was busy and that other people needed her attention too we weren't the only people there. There were 6 people total sitting at the bar including our party. Even then she continued to have her conversation with the manager about (Facebook, instagram ect.) One of the employees at the establishment knew my friend who I had come to pick up from there. She (the employee) left without paying her tab. The bar tender proceeded to tell us that someone needed to pay it and it wasn't going to be coming out of her money. I explained to the bartender that if she made an arrangement for her co worker to come back and pay that is not our responsibility. After about ten min of conversation and the bartender speaking to us like we were animals I asked to speak to the manager. The bartender refused to close out my friends tab until either her co worker came back or we paid for her drinks. The manager never came, the bartender continued to be excessively rude. Slamming things around ect. Finally after being stuck in your establishment against our will for 45 min with the manager no where in sight.. the employee who left her tab open arrived. On the way back from using the filthy restroom, with a hole in the wall where there used to be a urinal and the sink that looked like a crew of diesel mechanics came through, I saw the manager on my way back to the front of the restaurant. I stopped and asked her if she was the manager. She was in the process of asking the cook to make her food stating. \""You know I'm a good person ill pay you back.\"" Also at this point the employee who had left is now standing there and so is the bartender. I asked to speak with her and ask her if this was normal practice for your bartender to say to a guest who has never been to the establishment before (or even someone that knew the employee) has to pay for an employees drink who walked out on there tab. After I said that I had never visited the establishment before the bartender who is standing to the side says \""YES YOU HAVE\"" and I again told her that I had not at which point she has thrown her arms in the air and storms away. At that same time the cook who the manager was just bribing sticks his head out of a service window and says (he also sounded intoxicated) \""I've heard him being very disrespectful the entire time\"". Now don't get me wrong I was not very pleased that we were forced to stay there while the bartender withheld my friends credit card, but i was not disrespectful. At that point I had informed the manager that I had been recording this circus act unfolding in front of me. Her response was \""awesome\"". As she sputtered making no sense something about the bartender and it being her friend, she proceeded to tell me \""I didn't have time for this or you right now, I appreciate that so go back and watch your video\"". And walked away. I've tried to explain in the best of my ability what had transpired that night but the videos are unbelievable. I will never again visit a Baileys, I frequent Fox and Hound regularly with work functions and your bartenders there are less than favorable but bearable. I would appreciate a rapid response to this issue, preferably a phone call, and I never want anyone to have to deal with such barbaric people as my friend and I have. You might want to think about new staff. Especially the manager stealing food from your company. I believe her name was Lisa."
0,"Even with $30 Groupon for $15 its still overpriced....... \n\nFood is what you would expect from most fast food Chinese food places, however this is supposed to be a \""nice\"" upscale restaurant. Prices are high around $15 and up. OK so the shrimp are a little larger than the $5 lunch restaurants, big deal, still had softer texture than it should have. \n\nOn to service, and yes staff is everywhere, 3 different people came to take our order, one after the other.  It was kind of annoying because no one knew someone just came by 15 seconds before. Food came out real fast, again what I would expect from fast food restaurant. Obvious  success is based on turning tables, and getting me and family out the door.  All 3 dinners were all received at different times about one every 2 minutes, didn't seem right.   ....And then we never saw another server again......   No one  stopped by to ask is there anything else we can get you, ran out of beer, no chopsticks........\n\nBottom line is there is 2 very good restaurants you have to pass to get here, don't pass them.\n\nWILL NOT RETURN OR RECOMMEND"
0,"Nothing overly nice, about the same as a yard sale, but pricier. They only give you a third of what they plan to sell it for. So don't plan on making any money selling to them. Staff is rude & snotty with \""comments\"". While my sister has had very good luck with the store in her state, the Pineville and Matthews locations, I would not go into again. Especially Pineville. They  have always have an excuse why they can't \""accept\"" something. I swear I think they read off a list under the counter. Why are they in business? Maybe they don't want to buy top end stuff and would rather have a junky store. Try some of the other locations in Charlotte before this one."
0,"No matter how often I'm there, the staff is horribly rude - not just to me but to every customer. If I ever find another place to take children's items, I will not return. There is no excuse for the ugly attitude and behavior to everyone."
0,"No way will I be back any time soon. My husband and I went here for restaurant week and we were very disappointed with everything. I was able to make a reservation easily at the last minute and I was glad I we did. The line was endless and crowded. \n\nWe get seated and our waiter takes around 10 minutes for him to take our drink orders. Through dinner, he kept giving me my husband's drink, and his mine and our drinks were empty most of our dinner. We place our appetizer order in and ask if the baby's food can be brought out 1st. My husband orders the calamari and I ordered the lobster bisque. TWENTY FIVE MINUTES LATER (not exaggerating) we get the baby's food and our appetizers. The calamari was very good, but the lobster bisque could have used some cheese and salt. I wasn't all that impressed with it.\n\nWhile we are eating our appetizers, our salads come. Both of us ordered the cesar salad and it was the worst salad I had in a while. The salad dressing was very heavy on the anchovies and had a nasty taste to it. The croutons were homemade, yet extremely stale and chewy (if that's possible). It was so nasty, we didn't finish our salads.\n\n15 minutes after we FINISH our salads, the main course arrives on piping hot plates and placed IN FRONT of my infant daughter so she can burn herself. I ordered the Mediterranean seafood dish that had scallops, shrimp, lobster pieces, kalmata (sorry for the spelling) olive pieces, roasted red peppers, mushrooms, feta cheese, and risotto. I was very surprised to find out that my dish was actually really good. The flavors from the olives, the dressing that was put on it, and the seafood blended in really well. My husband ordered the filet minon medium rare, mashed potatoes, and zucchini medley. The filet minon was cooked medium with a very poor attempt of a holiendase sauce on top of the steak, it was tough to cut through, and the zucchini was not cooked all the way through. My husband was very dissapointed in the steak and regretted eating it.\n\nDessert was a joke. I ordered cr\u00e8me brulee and my husband had their almond basket with ice cream. My dessert was not cooked all the way through and the strawberries that was served with it were very sour. It also came with banana bread muffins, but I was so fed up with my meal at that point I didn't bother with them. My husband had a little better luck with his than I did. The ice cream and sauce on the bottom of the dessert were alright, but the \""basket\"" had sesame seeds on it and it completely threw off the taste. \n\nWe get our bill and come to find out it's $81. I scan through the bill and come to find out my daughters kiddie drink was full price at $2.25, her meal was a full price meal instead of the kiddie price like we were told it was at $8 and her kiddie ice cream (that was 2 HUGE scoops of half melted ice cream) was $4.95. We bring this up to our waiter (which that was the fastest he moved the whole night) and he told us there was nothing he could do and shrugged it off. Since we got that response, it was no use in complaining about our meals at all since we were going to get a nose snubbed at. \n\nIn general, we had a terrible go at it and I would not recommend this to anyone."
0,"I don't know why I keep going back to this place.  While talking to my wife about trying to find a home for a pit bull puppy, the manager told her to just have it put to sleep.  Nice customer service.  What a jerk."
0,"Very disappointed. Oven wasn't working so no pizzas available. Had French onion soup. Not enough cheese and I think Campbell's soup is better. Over priced for average, below average food. Maybe this is what's normal in Ballantyne but not what I'm used to. Not impressed. Going to leave and hit up McDonalds. Don't feel like spending another $12 on something just ok"
0,"Horrible food.  I hate to rag this place but...\n\nThe sushi is \""mall-quality.\""  It's not horrible, but it's just C-level fish.\n\nThe huge problem is the teppanyaki...just awful.  I ate there over the Christmas holidays.  I love this style of cooking and it's kinda hard to screw it up.  Here's how Kabuto managed:\n\n-  The chicken was so salty it was inedible.  I ate 3 bites and had a headache for the rest of the evening (and I like a lot of salt and seasoning).\n\n-  I also had a problem that neither the cook or the server questioned if there was a problem with the food since I hardly touched my chicken.  They probably didn't notice since...\n\n-  The cook just GLOPS piles of noodles and rice on your plate (and on the table) like he was slopping hogs!  Only a 3 year old could be comfortable eating here.  Just crap.\n\n-  I didn't say anything because my relatives have friends who work there.  If not for this, I'd have talked to the manager.  The food was awful and the presentation was worse.\n\n-  Our cook even screwed up the \""onion volcano\""...first time I've ever seen this botched.\n\n-  Kabutos wasn't always bad.  I used to eat there every few months back in the 90's (before I moved away).  It's really gone downhill.  They now serve mostly rice and (now) noodles, and only a few bites of vegetables...all of which are completely over-seasoned.  I honestly think the cook just doesn't know any better."
0,"The japanese food here is nasty compare to other places in Charlotte. I've been here a couple of times with my co workers, but what really irks me about this place was the other week I was craving for Japanese food so I order a TO-GO plate to pick up for lunch. How about they charge a 15% TO-GO gratitude!!! You heard that right. I've never seen such a place charged you for tip when you aren't even sitting in there asking for service. My to go meal ended up being $16 bucks after taxes and tip. \n\nOn top of that the fried rice was bland, its basically just cook in tons of butter. The meat were tasteless and dry and so were the veggies! They definately won't be getting my business again!!"
0,"If it were possible to give a restaurant a negative rating, this establishment would receive it.  My family and I have frequented Kabuto for years, but it has deteriorated so significantly we will never return.  The restaurant is run down, and not cleaned thoroughly.  On our trip tonight my four year old asked why it smelled bad when walking in the door.  The quality of the food has substantially gone down while the prices have increased.  The vegetables on the hibachi were not done at all, while the steak I ordered had a rancid taste.  When I complained the \""owner\"" started raising her voice at me in front of my young daughter and three other family members screaming that she would not allow me to say the steak I had been served was spoiled.  There is a reason this restaurant is having to run specials on a large plastic sign out front, and why the last time we visited there was only one other table in the entire restaurant.  It is very sad to watch a once good local establishment run into the ground."
0,"Reasons I will never go to this restaurant again:\n\n-Out of all the empty tables, the waiter (a creepy, older man) sat me at the table against a wall right next to the door, pretty much isolated and alone.\n\n-The waiter tried to find out where I was from (my ethnicity), where I lived, whether I was working that day and whether I was on my lunch break, whether I was married, and whether I lived alone or with my parents. \n\n-When I was getting food from the lunch buffet, my waiter would pop up from behind me and point to the last dish I got and say \""This, very good.\""\n\n-When the waiter had nothing to do at the moment, he'd stand against the wall across the room and just stare at me. \n\nI felt extremely uncomfortable there, and the buffet was not worth its price."
0,Probably one of the worst Indian  food I have ever had in USA. Went there for Sunday buffet and the food was terrible. Serving is bad and avoid this restaurant.
0,"Tried takeout yesterday. One of the worst Indian meals we have had in a long time.\n- Lamb Kabobs - undercooked and falling apart. They may have run out of time or maybe they had too many takeout orders. No excuse. A big F for this.\n- Chicken Makhni - C minus. tasted bland for what is supposed to be a very flavorful dish. Very small portion. \n- Saag Paneer - C+ The paneer tasted rubbery. Good flavor though.\n\nOne can understand, this is Charlotte and thus not a Indian food destination. But the miss on simple Kabobs clearly show a careless staff. Charlotte deserves better.\n\nIn my opinion, a waste of money."
0,"Worst indian food I have ever eat in US.  \n\nIf you read my review I bet you that you will regret if you give a try to this place. \nit's a joke of indian food. I have been eating paneer kadhai from 20 years and I know how it should taste. It was horrible. first time I went for dine in and the food was horrible , customer service was awful.  After 6 month we taught we will do take out order and will order something else than we ordered last time. I honestly thrown it in garbage as I felt horrible taste and smell in food. I didn't wanted to go sick after eating that."
0,"Absolutely horrible experience. We were seated and drink order was taken by that person. Few mins later drinks were dropped off by a different person who said waitress would be over to take our order. Then 10 mins later someone came over and asked us if we wanted appetizers which we did and ordered Crab Rangoons and Spare Ribs. This person said someone would be back to take our order. Never happened. The apps came out and the guy said again someone would come take our order. So we ate our apps and still no one. No one even acknowledged us, I had to flag someone down and I said \""I think our waitress has forgotten about us...\"" The man says \""what you want\"" ummm to order? Hes like \""Yes, what you want just staring at us, no smile or apology. So we ordered and got our food about 10 mins later. Had to wait forever for our check. I think we had a different server every time someone stopped by. The Crab Rangoons were simply not Crab Rangoons. There was no cream cheese flavor whatsoever. I am not sure what they were, but not what I was expecting. The Shrimp Fried Rice tasted ok but the Shrimps were full of poo. Not deveined and completely packed with poo. Just disgusting. Wonton soup flavor was good but the actual wontons must have had a teaspoon of ginger in them. Strong and not really what I was expecting in a wonton...Whole dinner sucked. To top it off there was vomit all over the womens bathroom floor. No idea why this place was full. Many great chinese restaurants around, this is not one."
0,"This place is bad! The service is bad, the food is bad and the prices are high! With our party of 4, we had a similar experience as Christina L. Where different waiters/waitresses would come by and awkwardly take our order, then someone else would bring out that order and then someone else would arrive to help us further.. The crab rangoons were very small and tasted generic, like something I could buy frozen at food lion and the shrimp in our meals ALSO were not deveined... And every dish we ordered was flavorless and bland... The only thing I enjoyed was the wonton soup! And then at the end of our meal, around 9:45pm we stayed at the table to chat.. Being cautious that the restaurant hours printed on the door said they close at 11pm.. A waitress came to us at 10pm and said that they were closing and they needed us to pay now... O_o  So we got up to pay and leave and the cashier man ( looked like the manager ) was so cold.. He never asked how the food was or anything, just \""this how much!\"" And swiped the cards... Such a waste of money and time.. Worst Chinese food ever!"
0,"No go. Bought the Groupon despite the other reviews and decided to give this place a try. The location, atmosphere, and service were all good so no complaints there. The food however was not. I ordered the general chicken with brown rice and an egg roll. The chicken was all slimy dark meat and the flavor was nothing like general sauce but rather 100% strong garlic. I wasn't able to even eat hardly any of it because of the brown slimy meat. My husband ordered the garlic beef and he did not like the sauce at all. It had zero garlic taste, was way too thick, and overall wasn't very good. The egg roll was soft and mushy and is a shrimp roll so not your typical chicken/cabbage type. The place was super busy and I had high hopes, but ultimately the food itself was not good and we will not be back."
0,"Not sure why the $$ this place is over priced and bad bland food. 12.95 for beef basil? They don't use real Thai chili peppers, I like spicy and asked for it. They sprinkle Nasty old chill powder which ruined the dish. No flavor and not worth $12.95 \n\nSkip this place.\n\nAlso called to let them know: response was \"" ok, is there anything else I can do for you??????????\""\n\nWow what rude jerks!!!!!!!"
0,"I am 8.5 months pregnant and ordered green curry for take out from here. When I placed the order, I emphasized I wanted MILD curry since spicy food has given me horrible heartburn during pregnancy. But, when I got the food home, the curry was so spicy I could not take more than two bites. Secondly, it was not that great. It was mediocre curry at best. So, goodbye $13 curry. Thanks for making the food too spicy for me to eat.  What the heck!?"
0,Tried a different Chinese Restaurant in the area and wish I did not. Got shrimp with mixed vegetables. The shrimp were small and very overcooked (very mussy). Also got the Teriyaki beef which  was like shoe leather (very tough). Will not be going back.
0,"Read review prior but my aunt wanted to eat so figured they may have improved since last reviews. Nope. Hot and Sour soup was bland. Crispy noodles were stale. My Sa Cha \""spicy\"" dish was missing the spice and broccoli in dish was visibly old. Should have followed my Yelp-stincts."

0,"My husband and I have always been big fans of Lowe's, so when we needed a new toilet where else would we go? They heavily promote the $99 installation, which worked for us. Through the selection and sales process they could not have been more helpful and friendly, but afterwards? I will never use Lowe's for installation ever again. \n\nI was told to expect a call within 48 hours to setup delivery and install. That call may come sooner, but they load down the contractors, so be patient. I was patient. Now, a week later, I have lost all patience. I have called the store to check in, and I am given the run around and absolutely no answer on when I can expect the call to even setup the installation. If it takes this long to SCHEDULE the installation, how long will it take for us to actually have our toilet? \n\nCalled again this morning to check on the status. After the man (same nice guy who sold us the toilet!) puts me on hold for 10 minutes because he has \""too much going on right now\"", he comes back and tells me that someone will be calling me this morning. \n\nMorning is almost over, no call, blood pressure rising..."
0,It was an overall bad experience here.  The tables were sticky.  The glasses were dirty. The service was slow and the food was tasteless.  I would probably not return here.
0,"The wait was over 30 minutes and the waiter was next to the worst. \nEven the mgr offer us a free dessert, but then the waiter said it was only for one.\nSmh!r\nIf I wanted to I could buy this place."
0,"I can't tell you how the food was because after waiting 10 minutes (with no line) to get a table, placing our order, and 20 minutes later with no chips and salsa, we left. I should've known to leave when the person sitting beside of us complained that his food had taken so long.  Terrible!!!"
0,"I believe I was the first Yelper to give this place a 5 star review.  I used to love this place and came here every time I came back to Charlotte from the west coast.  However, the last time I ate here back in May, something happened that ensured that I'll never come back.\n\nI ordered calabash shrimp, turnip greens, and coleslaw.  About 5 minutes into my meal, I took a bite of greens and felt something really sharp in my mouth...and pulled out an ~1 inch-long razor sharp grarled piece of metal...I'm pretty sure it was from the can lid the greens came from.  Anyway, had I swallowed it, it would have ripped me up inside.\n\nI told my waitress and the owner.  \""Oh we're so sorry.  Can I bring you something else?\""  My stomach had turned at this point so I said \""no.\""  At this point the brain-dead owner handed me the check and went to the register so I could pay!  \n\nRather than argue, I figured here's a guy that has seen me in here for over a decade.  All the waitresses know me and stop by and talk.  If he's so freaking stupid to want to charge me for a meal I didn't eat and that was contaminated with a piece of metal that could have sent me to the hospital or worse, I'll pay for the meal and let you guys know to steer clear.\n\nAVOID THIS PLACE IF YOU VALUE YOUR HEALTH!"
0,"Unfortunately I didn't even get to try their food as I was ignored when I entered by I'm guessing the manager or host woman.  I stood there as she looked at a phone after helping another guest. Then some guests entered behind me and she said hello to them immediately and then looked at me and said, have you been helped yet. I said no and she gave me a menu and told me to seat myself. They were full except one table that the guests behind me quickly claimed. She offered no further help and I offered no further business.  Would've been so simple to just acknowledge me and offer some service."
0,I'm not even sure where to start.  Horrible!
0,"Very upsetting!  Park 51 cafe is under new management.  Some of the new staff not near as friendly.  Norman, who has been there over 20 years is gone.  He was always quick to fill tea and bring out food if the waitresses were busy.  My husband and I started coming here when we were dating.  Now we need to find another breakfast place."
0,"So I have ordered from them many times over the years and got the food quickly; food was so so, but it was quick and cheap. Well scratch the quick now. Apparently they have become quite busy, but haven't bothered hiring more people to compensate for that. Ordered good for delivery and was told after the order that it would be an hour and 10 minutes. An hour and 20 minutes later and we still had no food...I called and was told that I should have been told it would be an hour and 20 minutes (as if an hour and 10 were not bad enough)...They assured me it was on the way. One hour and forty-five minutes after ordering we had our food. As usual it was mediocre at best. The apology was $5 off after I asked them what they could do and told them I was going to cancel the order. I will not be calling them again...it takes me 5 minutes to go pick up my own take out from several much better restaurants around me."
0,I dunno if I just get bad luck but I'll never order from this place again. I keep giving it a chance but this was the last straw. Twice I have ordered from here and found metal from scrub pads in the lo  mein noodles. I luckily did not ingest it which would have possibly torn up my intestines. When I brought the metal in and showed them they offered to rebook another order. I don't think anyone really understood the seriousness of this. I told them it was the premise of it. That is a hazard not someone complaining about the tastiness. I got a call saying they would give me a $10 credit if I came back. To be honest I was offended and just shook my head. So I though 4 months later since this place is literally right around the corner I'd give it a try. This time honestly it just tasted aweful. It tasted like everything was cooked in a pan with something that was burned before. I am not being picky here it literally tasted like I was sacking on a charcoal briquet. I'm pretty much done with this place and question the quality of food ordered and hygiene practices. Chinese restaurant are notorious for bad sanitation scores and this place is clearly pushing it. For your own health as far as eating metal stay as far from this place as you can. I'd rather get frozen Chinese from grocery store and microwave and it would be better.
0,"I was really disappointed in this place. I had heard it was good, but the food was terrible. I got crispy spring rolls, which were flavorless & I ordered the pad thai w/ chicken. It didn't even taste like pad thai. No flavor. I will not be coming back here."
0,"We ordered delivery from them tonight and we are so disappointed ! \n\nCoconut soup is too creamy,the flavor is there but its texture is too thick for soup.\n\nPad thai noodles were mostly vegetables , and it's kinda bland, and there's baby corns. WHY is there baby corns in my pad thai !!?!? Ugh !!! I would make a wild assumption that their cook is not from Thailand because this is not how an authentic pad thai should taste like. \n\nCurry fried rice was also bland, luckily we have sriracha at home. Again the curry fried rice is not authentic neither.\n\nWe will not order from this place again, sorry.\nFor those of you looking for an authentic or even great taste thai food, this is NOT the place!"
0,Precooked noodles in Ragu like sauce.  I got the Thai food (Phod Thai).  Don't do it!  There was a sprinkling of vegetables and not much else.  I asked for extra lime and onion and they gave me a tiny end of a lemon (not a lime) and no extra onions.
0,Ordered take out and wanted mashed potatoes....they have me a baked potato. I know it's not too big of a difference...but taste and accuracy are important to me. I waited over 30 minutes for my food that was supposed to take 15-20 and it was extremely cold. I work in the restaurant industry but I make sure my product is accurate and hot when it leaves the restaurant. I also ordered 2 breads with it and only received one. I'm extremely disappointed in this restaurant and it's not the first time I've had a problem.  Not just in this location but in a couple others.
0,"After having a sub par meal last night a table that wasn't bolted to the base took a tumble and i ended up at urgent care for stitches.  The owner didn't bother comping our meal ($135) and my MIL had to fight for her to bring it down.  She ended up paying $24. What an insult.  Then, after getting the 8 stitches needed in my ankle, i called to speak with owner and she never called back.  Worst customer experience of my life."
0,"I think they must have changed owners. The place looked completely different. The service was slow. I ordered a lunch plate of taco, enchilada, rice and beans. For the Mexican restaurant expert, the \""Speedy Gonzelas\"" \n\nI think it was the worst Mexican food I've ever eaten. Even Taco Bell's tacos were better tasting than this one. I took a few bites and asked for my check. The beans seemed to contain more lard than beans. The rice was dry and the salsa seemed to come right of the can.\n\nIf you looking for decent Mexican in the neighborhood, head to Cantina in Stonecrest or Senor Tequila on Rea Rd. Worth driving a few extra miles."
0,"I would not recommend Uptown Retreat. First, the receptionist quoted me $20 less than it actually cost, so thinking I was getting a great price at a convenient place, I made an appointment. Then, a little confused at the price increase, I asked what services would have been at the price she quoted me and she couldn't give me a direct answer, she just waived it off. I don't like being lied to. \nThe real problem was the hair cut. It was a disaster. I went back a week later to get it \""fixed\"" and they had to cut off all of the layers, for which I never asked, and now my hair is just as short as it was seven months ago when I wanted to start growing it back out. \nFinally, to top it all off, my roots are already showing and this appointment was only just over two weeks ago. \nWhen I called to get a refund they told me they don't give refunds and when I explained how disappointed I was and that I had already been for a fix-cut, I was told I had to come back in for them to look at it-- and then I was hung up on. \n\nSave your time and frustration and go somewhere else."
0,"Bank of America  ah yes the power of Ken Lewis squirming his way out of insider trading while he buys $100++ trash cans for his office and lays people off . Go figure ... screw the little guy. My trouble with B of A started I guess about well maybe 4 months ago . I decided on a Disney vacation and went on their web site ( Disney ) and booked everything with my Visa check card that is supposed to have fraud protection well it seems that the call center that Disney was using for these transactions had a team of scum bags that stole peoples credit card #s . Ok so I normally check my balance about every day or so anyway I checked it must have been 3 days after I booked and I had 3 charges one for nearly $10,000 another for about $12,000 then another for about $25,000 not only that everything that I charged bounced and there where about I guess $400 more dollars . \n       I called the bank two where used for cars and one for someones cruise  vacation I said wait a minute did it not raise a flag when a $25,000 purchase came threw  when I mostly just use it max of $1000. Well there must have been a \""bank error \"" they said. You damm right there was !!\n       Anyway the bank did put, the money back except and this is the shi..ty part they said I would have to pay the returned fees from the charges that I made and there was no money ? I said if you had caught those huge transactions it would have not been a problem. Any way we went round and round finally about 2 months later they fixed it then I closed my account I did not want to until this was settled .. Another Bank now \nScrew you Ken Lewis ...hope you go to jail for shi..ting on little people!!!"
0,I didn't not go to this branch specifically but I am writing a review on Bank of America in general not happy with here customer service. When trying to say something they pretty much tell you are even though I have papers in front of me showing when stuff have gone through and they are telling that stuff went through a different way. All I wanted was the fee taken off but they didn't even try they said they couldn't. I acknowledged I was going to go negative no matter what but it should of been a lower amount them what I was charged. Leaning toward leaving Bank of America because of poor service. C
0,"Terrible, none of the owners or the cooks have been near Mexico or real Mexican food. avoid if you can."
0,"Terrible.  The food is bland and boring.\n\nThe service was fast and friendly, but that doesn't make up for the complete disaster of a meal that we were served.\n\nI really can't overemphasize how bland everything was.   Don't go here if you require food that has some kind of flavor."
0,"Um...no!\n\nChips are obviously from bags.  Salsa were runny and definitely not spicy.  (Remember - \""made in New York City?!?!?)\n\nI had the carne asada.  It was ok.  I usually devour the entire place but I just couldn't get into it.  The rice was bland.\n\nOverall, it was just disappointing!  I should have just eaten at Qdoba which was nearby.\n\nService was mediocre. \n\nMoral: just because it is right next to the hotel doesn't mean food is gonna be awesome."
0,"I've eaten here for years.  I used to like it alot.  But over the past year or two, it's been downright mediocure.  Today it bordered on gross.  I ordered a beef quesidilla and thought I was getting steak.  I got some geasy ground beef I asume they use for tacos.  It bore no resemblance to a quesadilla.  It was just a taco with stuff on top. I  would have done better at Monterrey's, or even Taco Hell."
0,"I should've just gone to Taco Bell or Monterrey. After hearing rave reviews from Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Dominican friends, I finally got the opportunity to eat here last night. \n\nI arrived around 9:30pm and was sat instantly. we were the only party in the upstairs part. My friend, who is Mexican, chose to get the rice water (forgot the original name) and it was delicious! Chips and Salsa was plentiful, I didn't care for the salsa at all. Tasted bland and watered down to me. The chips were obviously out the bag, which I don't mind but some salt or some seasoning was needed. \n\nI ordered the Street Tacos and my friend got the Shrimp Fajitas. He loved his fajitas! Now, my Street Tacos on the other hand is a completely different story. The tortillas/soft taco shells were greasy and cold. I couldn't even eat them. The items inside the taco weren't that great either. Huge strips of chicken that tasted bland, barely there pico de gallo, and a sprinkle of cheese. There was lettuce and guac on the side. I also asked for sour cream on the side to try to make it taste good. It also came with rice and beans. The beans were beans, nothing special. The rice was the best part of the meal... but it was room temperature which I didn't like much.\n\nService is the reason why I will never give the food another chance. Our server was Ingrid. She was pretty great at first. When a Spanish speaking couple came to sit upstairs, she began talking to them so me and my friend had to wait about 10 minutes for the check once we were done eating. Then, she assumed the checks were together and seemed to have a shocked look on her face when I asked to get them split. We had to wait about another 10 minutes for her to finish talking to her manager/co-worker. The thing that that really put the icing on the cake was seeing a charge for sour cream. I wouldn't have minded if I knew when ordering sour cream with my tacos that there would be an extra charge, but to me that is just Serving 101 to tell a customer that all add ons were extra. Paying $1.25 to attempt to make the tacos taste a little bit better was ridiculous. When asked about it she told me, \""All add ons have a charge to the ticket\"". No attempt to atleast say, \""I'm sorry, but sour cream has a charge.\"" I just don't like being surprised when the ticket comes. There was a man, maybe the expo manager or kitchen manager that refilled our chips, salsa, and drinks. I'm not the greatest tipper, but I always tip 25-50% on inexpensive meals so I felt obligated to leave a note telling her that I would've tipped if I knew about the charge and if I could've got the ticket faster instead of watching her chit chat literally right in front of me while waiting for my ticket One of the first times in a while that I didn't tip. I'm in the service industry and I know that if I ever treated a customer like that, I would've gotten wrote up and had to have comped their meal out of my pocket. \n\nSuper long story short: Sub-par food, worse service."
0,"Legitimately the worst Mexican food I've had in Charlotte. Possibly the worst Mexican food I've ever had. Tacos were cold, soggy and tasted microwaved. I think they might have given me an order that was sent back and was being held. The rice was pretty decent. I took my food to work because I didn't want to waste it, gave it to some friends and it was promptly thrown away."
0,"My family visited the restaurant recently. There was a dispute about the bill and the manager was called in at the request of my family. The manager was not only not nice but very unprofessional. We are hard working people. We expect good service because we pay for what we order and also tip accordingly. We have never been treated so disrespectfully. There was not even an offer of, \""I'm sorry for the misunderstanding\"".....Attention all managers: Being apologetic in the face of controversy doesn't suggest a weakness. There was not even an attempt to right the wrong. We work hard for our money also and like to be wise in spending as we make decisions to relax and have recreation. My level of disappointment can not be expressed any further than saying.....This was really awful treatment of guests in your restaurant. No words......"
0,"Being from Louisiana, I'm a huge Smoothie King fan.  Lately they've changed all of their recipes and no longer use any real fruit.  Their general smoothie recipe is now 90% ice and 10% fruit juice.  GIANT waste of money as it probably costs them about 50 cents to make a large.  You can do better."
0,"The other Maggie Moo's locations have closed, but somehow this one hangs on.  I made the mistake of taking some friends in there the other night, though, and it was kinda gross.  The ice cream itself was OK, nothing to write home about but it did the job.  But, if you're an ice cream place that does mix-ins, your marshmallows should not be so stale they're positively chewy.  We sat and ate ice cream in the shop before going our separate ways home, and the place had a definite industrial cleanser stench that was hard to ignore."
0,Worst Italian food I have ever eaten. Think Chef Boyardee at ten times the price.
0,"I can't speak to the food, because for the first time in years, I walked out. \n\nAfter 20 minutes, I hadn't had so much as a drink order taken. I was willing to be patient, though, until two other tables were seated, and had multiple waiters take drink orders and bring bread. That was the final straw. \n\nMy companion and I were casually dressed in jeans and plain t-shirts, with sneakers, but certainly not slovenly, dirty, or otherwise worthy of such complete and utter lack of response. \n\nThe first thing that was addressed to us was as we rose to leave - and that was one of the servers helping one of the tables seated after us, to assure me that \""someone will be here to help you shortly.\"" No, thanks."
0,Had the worst Italian food ever.......
0,"I want to establish something before I review my dining experience here:\n\nIt doesn't matter how hard I slam this place.  No one that works there can do ANYTHING about it.  If you stocked Chili's with the greatest waitstaff, the greatest chefs, the greatest managers, the greatest dishwashers, et cetera, NONE of them could change the fact that the food is terrible.\n\nSo, people of Chilis:\n\nI salute your service.  I am positive that you do your best, every day, to squeeze this fat sloppy pig into that prom dress.  I appreciate everything you tried to do, and I tipped you well.\n\nThis being said...\n\nHow can I describe my experience here?\n\nFriendly staff: helpful, quick, efficient, wonderful people, all of them.  Really.\n\nThe food?\n\nWell.  First off.  Their chips and salsa is bad.  If I bought the least appealing salsa at the grocery-store, and the least appealing chips off the shelf, and put them into a wax-paper lined bowl, it would be very similar to this \""dish\"".  \n\nNow.  Ask yourself:  if the chips and salsa are bad...  how bad can the.,..\n\nFried shrimp be?  Pretty bad.  It comes with fries and cole slaw.  The fries?  The fries are fries.  Eh.   The cole slaw?  Pretty bad.  All together, it looked like a plate of \""brown\"" and a ramekin of shredded white, purple, and orange credit cards. \n\nThe shrimp tasted like... nothing.  Like chewy nothing and fried batter that squished when you chewed it.  The cole slaw?  Like crunchy nothing and mayonnaise.  \n\nEven the cocktail sauce was bad.\n\nDo I deserve this?  I mean...  shrimp from Chilis?  Even though the Atlantic Ocean is 4 hours due east, I bet that stuff came from some processing center in Texas.  It was DOA weeks ago when it was bagged, packed into boxes and flash-frozen.\n\nAll together...  I think it was about $20.00 because the drinks are jacked up.  Two sodas=like 5 bucks, right?  Off about 3 cents worth of carbonated water and flavored syrup.  They always make money on the drinks...\n\nFor the price, the food was awful.  Truly awful.\n\nBurgers that went to other tables LOOKED eatable, but still...  I can't help but keep thinking...  if the chips and salsa is bad...  what else is bad?"
0,"Of the Michaels in Charlotte this one is probably the one I like the least.  The store always looks terrible, but that is partially due to it being an older store.  The other reason the store looks so terrible is because its a mess (empty and disorganized shelves)!  I'm not sure if this store is physically smaller than the other Michaels in the area, but it definitely lacks selection.  Lastly, our cashier wasn't friendly and seemed like she was being in convinced by having to ring up customers.  For these reasons I generally go to Hobby Lobby or wait until I'm on the other side of Charlotte to go to a different Michaels."
0,"We went on a Friday night to start our night.\n\nWe were carded twice and they wanted to hold a credit card through our dinner!  The waitress said that was restaurant policy.  I am in my mid-30s and am way past the \""dine and dash age\"".\n\nThe menu has changed dramatically since the last time we were hear.  The food selection is basically wings, burgers and pizza.  \n\nVery disappointed to be treated like a punk kid and will not be back to this establishment.  \n\nI'd suggest heading across the parking lot to Flying Saucer."
0,"I'll keep this one short - DO NOT GO HERE! We waited about 20 mins to get a beer and then another 1/2 hr to get our check. Asked a couple other waitresses to get our waitress, but she seemed busy elsewhere. Finally came with our checks when a couple of us made it seem like we were walking out without paying.\n\nAnd btw, Flying Saucer is right around the corner and MUCH better. Go there instead. Seriously."
0,This Stool Pigeons has gone put at this location. Just wanted you to know so you wouldn't make the trip & be disappointed when you got here & saw the vacant space. Try Hickory Tavern right around the corner on Mallard Lake in The Arbors shopping center near the Trader Joes. Excellent!

0,I believe this location has closed and should be removed as a listing
0,Food is it great it's Showmars at least they can't screw that up.  Service is poor especially for pick up orders.  If you call ahead they will put you on hold until you drive to the restaurant.   Never had a problem calling in orders at any other Showmars.
0,"Okay, so I was completely prepared for the worst when I got here, since the average review for this place was about 2 stars.\n\nMy flight landed in the morning, and I called to see if checking in early would be an option. It wasn't. I should have a shot around 1:30pm, though.  Okay, cool..I'll find something to do for 4 hours. So I drop in at 2:30pm--surely they have ONE clean non-smoking room ready, right??\n \nNo....they don't. I'm a little annoyed at this point, but the girl behind the desk can't really do anything about it, so I walk back to my car and sleep for an hour....then finally, success. There's a $20(?) deposit on the room that should be refunded in about a week. We'll see. If you've read my other reviews, I NEVER have great luck with these \""deposits.\""\n\nAbout the room:\n-It's not new. But it's not old, either. \n-There's a tube tv circa 1999, no fridge OR microwave OR coffee machine. Those things you'll have to specifically request (for a fee!). \n-The walls? Terribly, terribly thin. I'm nervous about going to sleep tonight....and waking up in the morning.\n-Couple of hairs floating around the room. The bed, the lamp shade...and the shower wall was COVERED in them. Speaking of the bathroom...\n-Not cleaned. At all. Somebody's draws were on the door (I took a pic). The aforementioned hairs all over the shower wall. And there's no way in the world they could've cleaned that bathtub....it definitely hasn't seen any kind of cleaner in a while. The draws on the door were enough for me; I showered with a towel on the tub floor cuz I just didnt want to touch anything in there.\n\nYou'd think as long as they took to get me a room here, the room would be sparkling! Now I'm starting to think all they did was make the bed, fold some towels, and move on.\n\nI really wanna just leave here and sleep somewhere else, but I already paid for the room. I'm mad at myself for going through Priceline...the cheaper rate I got is not worth the hassle this place has been. \n\nDon't do it."
0,"Do not stay here. Awful. As though it's not shabby enough with the slowest \""service\"" in the daytime, a never-ending emergency alarm starts going off at 430  AM. False Alarm."
0,"do not spend your hard earned money here unless you want lousy repairs made, sass from the service representatives, and huge labor cost.\n\nbrought my vehicle in for emergency service. was told the wait would be over 4 days due to mechanics quitting! are you kidding me? once the shoddy repair was made, a new major problem was created so i bring me vehicle back so they can fix it right, and am greeted with \""i'll see if we have time for this\"" from the service representative. what a joke. worst part is my vehicle afterward still had a problem! you do not pay hundreds of dollars for less than perfect service. for the amount of money spent on 1 repair, you could buy yourself a brand new bicycle and be much happier.\n\ni ended up taking my vehicle to my trusted import mechanic in greensboro, where the problem was finally fixed the right way.\n\nin the end, do not trust this dealer--this is one of the worst volvo dealerships i've seen and i have seen many."
0,"Dealing with the Service Advisor at this dealership is useless. They make promises and don't keep them! Volvo want to be a luxury car, but they have a lot to learn on how to be a luxury car dealership. Good luck on getting warranty work done at this place, or as far as that matters, any good quality work, with good customer service! Evidently, tolerance level is very high, from Volvo of North America Corporate office, for low achiever dealers. I think they can take a lesson or two from any local luxury car dealerships. It's ashame I can't score University Volvo a \""0\"", instead of one star!!"
0,"After being nickle and dimed about our trade-in to the point were we were about to walk out the door, our front tire goes flat the next day. After re-inflating it continues to lose air and we have to bring it to a garage due to being stranded. They showed us a defect in the tire where the side wall was bulging out the size of a golf ball. The garage mentioned that if we were on the highway we could have been killed as it would have been a total blowout. We then bring it to the Charlotte Volvo for repair and they send us a picture of another damage where someone had previously patched the tire. We then have the same sales manager for the next  2 months do the biggest finger pointing game we have ever seen. Calling and emailing that they are not responsible. Wow, 3 days after getting the car we had to have it towed and he is finger pointing. It shows what type of operation this is with no concern for our safety and the risk they put us in."
0,really wished we would have read the reviews before staying here. We came to Charlotte for a three day convention and this hotel was conveniently located to the convention center. \n\nThe only good thing I will say about our stay was that the first person we dealt with was very pleasant. We booked a room with two queen bed because we had friends staying with us for one night. The room we got had a king size bed and a gross looking pull out couch. There other rooms we supposedly booked so we had to deal with it. \n\nThe room itself was very hot and we had to call maintenance to come look at the HVAC. When he came he had to go in the ceiling and switch the unit from heat to ac because the units were the same units they installed in the 80's and you have to manually switch from heat to cool. He let us now that the room would more than likely get cold in the evening because the temp that night was supposed to get down in the 40's but he would gladly come back. It did indeed get cold. \n\nThe beds where not as bad as in the other reviews but if two people sat on the edge of the bed then the whole bed actually flipped up and put you on the floor. The floors by the way really need to be steam cleaned. I walked around in my socks and they were brown after just a few minutes. Very nasty. \n\nThey give you three bath towels and have signs up that ask you to reuse your towels. That is fine but with four people we requested more towels and additional bedding for the pull out bed. After an hour a gentleman finally brought up just sheets. They were hot which made it seemed like they were washed when we called. A large hotel does not have sheets clean and ready to go? I called again to get towels but no one came. It was late so we just gave up. In the morning I just went and got them myself. \n\nWe barely slept at all the whole time because the walls are paper thin and all we heard all night was sirens which sound like they are right outside your window. \n\nThe whole time I stayed there I thought I was getting sick because I was stuffed up and sneezing. Did not start until the evening we checked in. On the day of check out I happened to glance up at the vent close to the ceiling and was absolutely horrified to see black mold growing on the bathroom wall. I took a paper towel to see if it was just dust but it was not. I informed the front desk but they just insisted it could not possibly be mold. Not one person even offered to go look. I will be reporting this hotel. \n\nIn summation.... AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!!!!
0,"Avoid this place at all costs.  Horrifically uncomfortable mattress?  Check. Paper thin walls and a creaky floor/ceiling that sounds like others are IN your room?  Check.  Gangs if bikers partying outside your door and yet miraculously - and loudly - coming to blows in the morning?  Check.  By all that is holy, do NOT stay here.  \n\nI would give 0 stars if allowed..."
0,Ridiculous. Had to wait 15 minutes for a latte with 8 people working there. Avoid at all costs.
0,"Stayed on 8 floor, for 4 nights, had to call down every single night at 12:30am-1am and ask them to shut the music off outside.  Seriously?  They were playing some drum and bass that would slightly rattle the windows.\n\nExpensive in comparison to the other hotels around the area.\n\nFriendly staff, but having to call down 4 nights in a row\n\nFree wireless"
0,"The last two times we've had to pick up prescriptions, we have been told a time they would be ready and have arrived promptly expecting things to go quickly and smoothly. However, the last two times they have lied and we have spent over an hour each time waiting for things to be done that they claimed were already done or would be done in 5 mins, 10 mins, 15 mins, etc etc (but never were and always ended up around 1 hour mark). This location needs to get more staff or less work but either way they suck. PS. I severely dislike liars. Just saying."
0,"CVS' Minute Clinic should be renamed. I have found it to be significantly less convenient than making an appointment with my doctor. Due to my employer's requirement to get a wellness screening for insurance purposes, I have found myself signing in to the minute clinic on 5 separate occasions. Each sign in requires enough info that it takes 5 minutes just to sign in. Only then are you informed how long the wait will be.  I have tried 2 different CVSs at varying times throughout the day (from 8 am to 4 pm) and the wait has never been less than 2 hrs. \n\nIf you have the option to go elsewhere, save yourself the headache of eternal wait times and do so."
0,"I love Hampton hotels more than anything but this was a terrible experience.  Surly staff that was never at the desk. If you called out hello, they told you to wait, usually as they finished texting on their phones. And dont count on housekeeping. They never serviced our room, no new towels no remade beds. Only the post it note on the bed saying it was cleaned for us. Also, the elevators over heated at midnight setting the alarm off and putting the elevators out of service. Thank goodness I was staying on the first floor with my disabled mother. Run away from this property as quickly as possible!"
0,This place is horrible and has crappy service. They try and get over on large groups with a service charge that is 2x higher than the normal 18% tip for 8 or more guests....
0,"Food is great I can't say much for the service and the hostess who upon arriving welcomed us with a \""what!\"""
0,"First off let me say this TGIF is gonna get the brunt of a couple of other TGIF visits I've had around the Charlotte area. I'd say i've had a couple of other visits to TGIF's in Charlotte and I don't recall them being a good experience. I kinda forgot that until we headed there on a whim and right away i remembered, ohhhh yea, this place is soooo loud. I'm not talking a little loud, I'm talking scream to place an order or ask your wife sitting next to you what the waiter said. Yep, that loud. \nIt took us about 15 minutes to get seated was what they had advised. The waiter was good and provided really good service (Once we could hear each other). It took another 30-45 minutes to get our food and then another 10-15 to get bill and checked out. Almost 2 hours is way to long for a meal, especially when it's impossible to have any sort of conversation with the others in your party. \nSo I believe over the years i've tried TGIF's 3 times or so and I'm pretty sure this will be the last time. Fool me once shame on you, fool my twice shame on me, fool me three times......."
0,"I went to this TGI Friday's on a Friday night, so I went in knowing it was going to be a pretty busy place.  I didn't think it was going to be as bad as I experienced.\n\nWhen my party walked in, it didn't seem like the five people at the hostess stand really wanted to greet us and were more concerned with mingling amongst themselves.  We told them we had a table of five, and one of the hostess' informed us it was going to be an hour wait.  Since we were hungry, we walked out of the restaurant, and one of the workers started waving us down because they had an opened table.  The sad part?  The opened table that was already clean was RIGHT BEHIND them.  Five people couldn't see an opened table clearly behind them?  Wow.\n\nAfter we sat down, we were greeted by a nice waitress, but her service was not all that great.  Through out the night, it was hard to find her or get her attention because she would pass by our table.  She also didn't seem as concerned when I informed her that my appletini glass had a lipstick mark on it.  My friend was able to spot it across from the round table we were sitting at, and she didn't even see it before she handed it to me.  \n\nThe food was good, but took way too long to receive.  I think that we waited a good 30 minutes for our appetizers.  I don't even know how long we were waiting for our entree as I started getting cranky and moody like I always do when I'm hungry.\n\nI feel that I probably won't be going back to this location again."
0,"Had a party of 18 this past monday after my friends child graduated from h.s\nSo after we was seated ( in 5 tables instead of putting any together, they state it was a fire hazard) waiter took FOREVER to get our drink order then another lifetime to bring them. At that point we realized we needed to place our food order then to insure we would actually eat the same day.\n25 mins later 3 of our partie's 18 orders came. 10 mins later the power goes out. After 10 mins, 0% chance of getting any food. Then my friend, they have the balls to bring us a check for all the drinks and the 3 meals. So 3 people get 25% done with their food eating in the dark, the other 15 people look on starving, and THEY GIVE US THE WHOLE BILL, without a penny taken off.\nThen the kitchen starts smoking and fire trucks come, yet we are in there trying to settle our bill.\nNeedless to say, won't EVER go back there again."
0,"Poor service! Manager has a bad attitude because they messed up my order and I called him out! Basically, he tried to say they no longer serve the salad with an item, but its on the NEW menu! When I called him out, he proceeded to get loud and walked away! WTHay! #poor_customer_service\n#pissed\nI am calling the GM! Pronto!"
0,Meal was pretty average but would not go on a Friday night again. Very questionable patrons lots of leather tattoos and women that were overweight with tight clothes can you say cheap hooker!
0,"The worst I have had on the road. I stood at the entrance way for 3-4 min, and that was with 3 workers, then another came up, turned her back to me and started talking to the crew. Then finally a crew member ask, how many to your guest? I then said I'm here to pick out an order... \""Oh, just go to the bar\"".... Then I get to the bar, I don't drink or smoke, but that was jus t another 5-10 mins more. Even though my pice up time has past by 10mins already. So I get my food and walk across to the hotel that I'm staying at, get to my room, go to eat my food it was the correct order..... But..... The food was COLD....... TGI, on WT HARRIS, in Charlotte NC, please get it together,, you never know who is in your presence."
0,I don't like the restaurant portion of this TGI Fridays so I always order to go at the bar (live right across the street).  I always order the same salad but tonight I found a large kinky pubic like hair in it.  Absolutely disgusting!!!
0,Had the absolute worst dinner experience tonight at TGI Fridays on Harris Blvd. Bottom line- the manager would not remove a charge from our bill for food they told us was at a discount AND wouldn't remove a charge for food we did NOT get. He also told me that customers were liars and he wouldn't believe that one of his employees would tell us something wrong. So just FYI - if u are a customer here u might want to rethink as you are a liar! Please share so others liars are in the know. \nNow mind you- this manager treated me this way all over $6.00.
0,"my husband & i, went here for lunch. it took then forever to get to us. Our Waiter took our drink order & didn't even bother to offer an appetizer. he came back with our drink, did not give us a straw & quickly turn around and came back 15 mts later.  the menu was alot different than the last time we was at Applebees.] everything look really good. \nSo we finally got to order (we were starving by this time) I order half rack baby back ribs plate,(witch i had before) they had always been yummy,but not this time. let me tell you it was just a plate with dry ribs, hard ( some rotten like)french fries and no slaw i had to ask for it (it came w/plate),15 minutes pass before a got my slaw.\nmy hubby got a combination Cajun steak with shrimp, rice and beans; the rice and beans were hard and dry, so he end up eating the steak  and 3 shrimp only.\noh if i had to mention the appetizer ,,I mean terrible, a spicy queso dip with chips were grease and not very well done.\n we was disappointed of the food and service.\nbad service & terrible food, don't recommend."
0,"I've visited this location many times in the past and the only thing that I have to say is \""This place has really fallen off.\""\n\nOne of the first things that you'll notice when you walk in on a weekend, is that the overall atmosphere of the place seems to be gloomy.  You just get the feeling that the people eating there aren't really enjoying themselves.\n\nThe food is really bad.  The riblets that I had during my last visit tasted like they were a few days old and had been microwaved, even the bones were dry and there was an odd freezer burned like taste.  My mother had a steak and after cutting into it and taking a bite, she swore that it had been microwaved.  We both had salads which seemed to be extremely small and were made with ingredients that were close to their expiration date (limp lettuce, slimy tomatoes, and old cheese).  I should also mention that the salads were served warm along with lukewarm dressing.\n\nThe overall service was nothing to really write home about (as the old saying goes).  Given the ratio of waitresses to customers, one would expect the service to be more prompt, but it wasn't.  The food also seemed to take a really long time to come out, about 45 mins for a steak with fries and riblets with fries, it may have actually been closer to an hour.\n\nIf you're in the area and in a bind to find something to eat, I recommend that you either find somewhere else to go or just save your money and hit one of the local grocery stores.  Since Applebee's is a chain, I don't think Kitchen Nightmares will be coming to save them :)"
0,Very bad service. Also my girlfriend got very sick after eating here. Also notice that the chicken she had ate was undercooked. DO NOT GO TO THIS APPLEBEE's
0,"Took 30 minutes to get our drinks and still had to wait another 10 additional minutes for our waters.  When we asked for a lemon for a drink, the the waiter came back with a whole bowl of lemons to be rude. When they finally came out with waters and the bus boy asked if we wanted straws, someone replied yes, he threw 10 straws on the table.  Customer service has been awful and I would not return."
0,"Some of the worst customer service we've ever encountered. We've been \""next\"" on the list for 45m. Understandable that it's a friday night, but of the 6 people on staff, 3 were flirting with people (no joke, I saw numbers exchanged, and not for Verizon purposes) and the other three were hiding in the back. As we left, I said to the manager, \""remove us from your list, we're leaving.\"" She says \""okay sorry,\"" not apologetically, but reflexively. Verizon is going to lose customers for this. Do not go to this location."
0,Awesome place if you like your hair looking like you are 8 years old. Disappointing.
0,"I got there just to try the new triple steak sandwich. The price was good and the staff were nice. The place is good to sit and enjoy the meal.\n\nUPDATE (8/3/14): it seems that drive-thro staff are a little different. Since I like the food, I wanted to try something new and asked for it by the number when driving through. I ordered something and the cashier was saying some details about which or what thing I want as the options. But I wasn't familiar and asked her to repeat (and she was talking very fast) and she refused, thinking that I (We) are some kids playing with the mic. \n\nI asked for the third time, and she said this is not funny (!) and I told her nobody is trying to be funny. So, she called the manager, and he just asked is what we wanted, ignoring what had happened and the food options. The cashier was disrespectful, and the manager was having her back being rude to us.... It was a really bad experience. They didn't put any sauce for us in the bag and no receipt as well. At the window, when she saw us, she said \""I thought you are fooling around\"". I am not sure how appropriate is to talk to a customer like this. I had a really bad experience with this TACO BELL... maybe if we were Americans, it could not happen... disappointing as we live in 2014...."
0,"Went to this Shoney's for the first time with my fiance for the breakfast buffet. We first walked in the the waitress at the front seemed a little distracted, she was not pleaureable at all and she didnt even smile. Once seated at the table we received another waitress who was indeed very helpful but looking around at other waitresses they also seemed distracted and like they didnt want to work. They had attitudes and didnt want to help the customers. One man at a table next to us went to ask her a question and she quickly said your waiter will be here shortly and all the man wanted was more napkins. Mind you his waiter never came. On top of that the food was very salty and greasy. Id suggest they do back ground checks on their employees and hire folks with good customer service and perhaps hire them a little older because the bunch that were there were very young."
0,"I  AM also one of those that when it opened it was pretty good for a chain...BUT, they changed greatly in food quality and portion size.I spoke with the manager she I think said they have had to cut back.

0,"HORRIBLE.  REALLY HORRIBLE.\n\nThe only reason I gave this place 1 star, is because it wouldn't let me give it a ZERO rating.\n\nAs a food lover and as a BBQ lover this place deeply saddens me.  It saddens me because it has the potential to be a really great establishment.  I say this because the facilities at Smokey Bones are well-above decent.  There is plenty of parking.  The inside of the restaurant is spacious and includes a nice, roomy bar as well.  There are plenty of TVs draped throughout the restaurant.  Their screen setup could be awesome, except they aren't HD.  They are the big box TVs from the early 90s.  In addition there is a speaker at every booth which allow you to listen to the TV of your choice.   \n\nWithout wasting too much time on this place - I ordered the the half-rack of ribs.  Though they looked (see pics) and smelled great, THEY WERE THE MOST DREADFUL RIBS I've ever had.  ANYWHERE.  The ribs tasted as if they had been cooked the night before, thrown in the cooler over night and then taken out and reheated and served to me for lunch. \n\nThis place shouldn't be allowed to serve ribs or even call itself a BBQ restaurant.   DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!  Try McDonald's or Boardwalk Billies both nearby, instead.  In the words of the famed Randy Moss, \""I wouldn't feed that sh*t to my dawg!!!\"""
0,"sadly, my only southern bbq experience was here, only out of convenience since it was within walking distance to our hotel. the local coworkers weren't fans of it either. the food wasn't THAT bad, but the service was horrid by one of our two servers. we were a group of about 12, and the female waitress was in her own little world. example, she forgot about our cornbread, saying she wasn't sure if we were ordering it since we had ordered fried kettle chips. really? when our senior VP asked for Kendall Chardonnay, she repeats it as Ketel One? Really?!?! 5 people ordered wine, and the first 3 got it in wine glasses. the other 2 got it in irish coffee mugs as they ran out of wine glasses, i think the 3 were the only ones in the restaurant. oh when our Senior VP asked about his glass of wine, she told him they were still making it. making wine? really? sorry, but she got on my dang nerves as she was forgetting everything, and never asking if we needed anything. our other server, jared was great and prompt. however, he said he made my mojito, and it was the sweetest mojito i ever had. as sweet as the sweet tea. no bueno. i didnt taste any alcohol.\n\nthe fried kettle chips were good, but the only sauce that was good was the bleu cheese. i got the sweet tea, as i wanted to try everything southern, and the first was uber sweet. second one was not sweet at all! so odd. not consistent. the corn bread skillet, was very cake-y, not enjoyable. \n\ni ordered the 3 item platter, as i wanted a taste of everything. had the sausage (Was told it would be spicy, yay!), pulled pork, and the beef brisket. i chose the fancier side of macaroni and cheese (a must for me) and their coleslaw. the mac and cheese, although we killed it, it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. the coleslaw was just ok. the pulled pork was good, but it tasted like something i have had in CA. dissapointed. the brisket was bleh. the sausage was disgusting, and not spicy at all. oh i think the best thing was the texas toast like bread that came with the dish. sad. \n\nlastly, their bathroom REEKS of URINE. i thought it was just me, but my other coworkers had the same reaction without me telling them beforehand. it's a large restroom (about 6 stalls), and it seriously smells like someone peed all over the ground. the employees must use this restroom, are they immune to it and have not noticed? yuck.\n\nwouldnt come back again."
0,"Came here for lunch with a work associate and we both had the Pulled pork sandwich.  Unfortunately, I ordered the Mac 'n' Cheese, which I was told by the lovely waitress, that it was delicious!  Well, the sandwich came and was okay, but after taking one bite of the Mac 'n' Cheese, I couldn't believe what I was tasting:  this had more garlic in it than a 5 lb loaf of garlic bread!  I immediately complained that there's no way that anybody who deals with people could eat this and still have friends after!  The waitress agreed but said that \""this is a recipe that came from  Management and there's no changing it!\""    The Chef even came out and said the same thing, which makes me think that not only is the Mgt. of this place \""out to lunch\"" (hopefully at a different restaurant), but that they're also tone-deaf and \""hard of tasting!\""\n\nWhat are these \""Management people\"" thinking?  Don't they realize that #1) Mac 'n' Cheese doesn't need any garlic, and #2) that people come here for lunch and need to get back to work, and there's no way that this amount of garlic is going to be a good thing for the person that eats it! \n\nI'm certain there's got to be better BBQ places in N. Charlotte, and I look forward to finding them the next time I'm in town."
0,"This was a bad experience from the start. The hostes told me that there was a one hour wait (even though the dining room was half empty). Twenty minutes into my wait, two parties came in and were seated while I waited. After complining I was seated.\n\nOrdered a salad and ribs. The salad was good, the ribs were as tough as leather. The baked potato had to be broken with fork and knife since it probably had been baking for hours.\n\nThe only good thing about the experience was the server which was very attentive and appologized profusely for the innedible food."
0,"Was in town for a family reuinion and this place was right by the hotel. We had a party of 7. The service was HORRIBLE. There were only 2 other tables occupied but it took a century to get our food. Then 6 out of 7 of us had incorrect orders. Our waitress noted that they had mixed up several plates btu instead of offering to fic it assumed that we would just all trade portions of our plates to make a correct plate. UH NO! All of our baked potatoes were hard and cold. It was a mess. Then when the bill came the waitress didn't even acknowledge the poor service with an adjustment on the bill or even an i'm sorry.  I had to ask for the manager and explain the entire debaucle to get any attention. In the end, the manager knocked 50% off the bill so I give him kudos for that. But thats about it."
0,"This was the most disappointing BBQ restaurant I have ever been to! From the time I opened the menu and noticed the up selling on items like the sides, and burger items, calling sides regular sides, fancy sides \""in which you pay more,\"" then fancier sides \"" in which you pay even more.\"" These side were basic sides that usually accompany BBQ dishes, and the mac & cheese tasted like Kraft box mac & cheese. My soup was cold and tasted like they just took it from a package and poured it right into a bowl. I told the waitress about the cold soup so she offers to give me a Caesar salad to go, and they poured the dressing on it to send me off with a soggy salad. The brisket was tuff and awful, and the steak was spongy. The most important flaw was that none of their items tasted smoked. Smokey bones is the McDonald's of BBQ with a bar."

0,"A Tale of Two Franchisee's. I ate at the 7th Street location today & had an incredibly pleasant experience. However, it vastly reminded me of just how much of an abomination this University location is. I've never seen the lettuce any color other than white or brown.

The napkin bins apparently have never been cleaned as they're caked with every dried up condiment imaginable. \n\nEvidently I'm a glutton for punishment since I have been back a few times to give them chances to redeem themselves, yet return to work after eating and felt sick, twice.

Well I took the invoice and drove back home thinking what I could do to come up with 1,000 bucks.  I googled the part number and on amazon the same part was selling for 110.  So they were going to charge me more than 3 times what it was selling on amazon for????  Is this normal???  Then I did a little more research and found out that wasn't even the right part!  They were going to put in the shocks meant for the front of the car instead of the rear.

One guy said it was going to be 9.95 more because my car is a newer car (08 beetle ) and that they had to use a different oil filter . I told him that i had never heard that before in the many years i had my car and he just walked away and said well i can get the manager to explain to you and didnt even give me a chance to say anything else. Not the first time i take my car to a Meineke but it was the first time i bring it to this one and the last !"
0,This hotel has the worst customer service that I have ever seen. They were rude and the room wasn't clean. They had several homeless people hanging out in the lobby.
0,This place is a nightmare. The price is appealing but not worth it. The room I was given has water damage in the ceiling near the window. The light fixtures were hanging out of the ceiling and were surrounded by mold. And the door would not lock. I asked for a refund and left immediately.
0,"Do NOT stay here! The rooms are extremely cramped! Absolutely zero walking space! The bed was very uncomfortable! The iron in our room didn't work so when we called to the front desk to ask for another the lady was very rude about it and asked if we could bring the broken iron down to her. The only thing about it was that the iron was locked on to the ironing board with a cable making it impossible for me to remove it. When I informed the lady of the secondary problem she became very annoyed with me and asked me to come down and just pick up a different iron. Also, there were teenagers hanging out in the lobby unattended and they were being extremely inappropriate. The lady at the front desk didn't bother to tell them to take their inappropriate behavior back to their room. The entire place was just filthy! Oh, and the free breakfast was nothing more than dry cereal and juice. The milk pitcher was never once refilled. I will NEVER return to this dump ever again!"
0,I've been eating Sushi for 23 years and they serve the worst sushi I've ever had!!!!! The service was bad as well! The Sushi was served very fast because no one was ordering it!! I wish someone told me it would be the biggest waste of 120.00 I've ever spent!!! I'll never return!
0,"Horrible management Drew (night manager) was very unprofessional with a refund I needed. After spending over 10,000$ on flooring and a new TV entertainment center they gave me a hard time over a 50$ refund. What a joke. I canceled my membership and they lost a customer for life. Way to keep business Drew. You may have saved the store 50$ but you lost a customer for life. I'm sure the upper management team would not agree with your business decision on this one.\nstore at \nSam's Club\n\n8909 JW Clay Blvd, Charlotte, NC"
0,"The buffet is of a good size, and it does appear to be kept relatively fresh, but I'm going to have to say that the quality is... questionable.  I'm not trying to say that the food is undercooked or anything along those lines.  Just that when you bite into a piece of teriyaki chicken on a stick, it should generally taste like chicken (or at least a meat that tastes like chicken).\n\nDoing so here tasted like, well, something else.  In fact, just about everything here tasted like something else.\n\nAgain, it wasn't that the food was bad or out-of-date or anything.  It is just that everything - meat, vegetables and even sauces - didn't taste quite right.  It's quite possible that the taste buds in my mouth were off or something, but a bite a short while later at the bakery was just fine.  So my money is on the Lotus Buffet.  You can draw your own conclusions."
0,"Literally the worst Chinese buffet I have ever been to. I'm shocked this place has 3 stars. My husband enjoys buffets so I allowed him to drag me here, but I will not be returning. \n\n-Execution of everything was poor. Sushi was mushy. Vegetables limp and overlooked. All sauces were too sweet and most tasted the same. Some items had no flavor at all. Just mush and a colorant. \n\n-Nothing on the buffet was hot. Nothing. It wasn't even warm. I have no idea how this hasn't failed a health inspection. \n\n-The ice cream variety was nice. But the amount of kids hanging into the case and slobbering into it was disconcerting."
0,"I'm a huge fan of Kohls and moving to the Charlotte area has pushed me to find a different Kohls than the one I always went to an hour away. And here it goes, from the many other Kohls that I've stepped foot on, this is the most disorganized department store I've been to. \n\nThe prices are higher than other Kohls' for the EXACT same product. I purchased a cardigan for $21 at the Charlotte Kohls while the day after I visited my hometown Kohls and found the exact cardigan for $15. That was a return. \n\nThe selection in this Kohls is so poor. I asked an associate if she could help me find a pencil skirt in the middle of the summer and she said that they don't carry skirts. How can they not carry skirts?!?! \n\nLast week I stopped by to get the battery of my watch changed. I purchased this watch for $250 at their store and when I asked the lady to change my battery she told me that she is afraid to do it because she broke her watch changing the battery. Are you kidding me? You also have to pay for a battery change while other Kohls change it for free. \n\nI love Kohls but everytime I've been to this store I've gotten an attitude from most of the associates and never been able to find a good deal so I've stopped going."
0,"I received a PJ set as a gift from my Mom for Christmas. She paid $19.20 for the top and $19.20 for the pants which = $38.40 total.  Unfortunately, they were too big, so I had to return them for store credit. Upon doing so, I was told that the items were now on sale, and that they would only refund me the sale price, which was $14.39 per piece, plus they were deducting the $10.00 Kohl's bucks that she received for the purchase. So, my Mom paid $38.40 for the PJ's and because they did not fit and I had to return them, I was given $20.05.  \nThe Kohl's cash I almost get, but not refunding the original price paid for the items is bull! But the taking the Kohl's cash promo away from the gift receiver is crap as well. It's a promotion the store is doing and as it turns out, it's just a big money maker.   I will never shop at Kohl's again, and I will ask my friends to do the same. Especially if for a gift. Not a happy customer. Goodbye Kohl's"
0,"Went to check out a game with some friends and was horrified at our service.\n\nOne of our party received a cold pizza roll and brought it to our server's attention. \n\nHow tacky can one be in deciding to stick one's finger in a patron's food and declare the patron wrong?\n\nUnbelievable. \n\nAnd then the manager decided to get in on the action. He made a special trip to our table to declare the server was correct in her statement and her action because she was requested to stick her finger in the food in question.\n\nReally?\n\nIf this is any indication of how customers are treated at Picasso's, rest assured that members of my party took note and WILL spread the word.\n\nMy first and last visit. \n\nThank you for a great football Sunday."
0,I went to Picasso yesterday as a single lady just to get a drink & some food. The service is terrible! This is my second time going. Every time I go the lady behind the bar looks like her dog just died. It took forever for them to come to me. I didn't get one smile from either bartender. The roll I had was good. But I can find good food elsewhere I prefer good service!
0,"Stay Away!\nI had two items: a Caesar salad, and a margherita pizza.\nCaesar salad:\nThe outer leaves of the head, at the top, with brown edges.  Hacked into random too-large and too-small pieces.  With some of the stems that were turning translucent from being too old.  Overdressed.\nPizza:\nWeird, bread-like crust.  And not bread-like in a good way.  With sauce that had no seasoning; I think it was just tomato sauce from a can (like hunt's).  The cheese was OK, the tomatoes were flavorless.  It was covered with chopped green herbs.  Basil, you think?  Hah: parsley!\nThe complimentary bread was good."
0,"We have dined at this chain for over 20 years. It was one of our favorites. Well bubba, those days are long gone. Ate at the one nearest us in Savannah and noticed the flavor and quality of my dinner (Pasta Rustica) was not up to par. Server said the new owners are all about the bottom line and are changing the recipes. Hello new owners; this is a recipe for disaster. \""If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\"" \n\nDecided to give them one more shot. Big mistake pigboy! The Carbonna was horrible, and that is as kind as I can get. Do they have a corporate taste kitchen? It was a bucket of dry pasta with some cheese and meat. A poached egg on top? Not the way to do it. Egg is an integral part of the recipe, not an add-on to pretend this is breakfast too. I tried to eat it but simply could not; even after dousing it with olive oil. There was no sauce; no moisture. Besides, the egg pasta was too thick. \n\nServer did a good job. I asked to speak to the manager. She was gracious and, to her credit, comped my dinner and gave us a free desert. Class act. \n\nBut that was the last time. If you have patronized this place over the years before it was sold, you can now forget them. Do not waste your money."
0,"o sole mio.. o sole mio... \n\nI forgot what I ate, and I forgot what I drank..\nSays a lot about this chain restaurant.

I was like, lady, the place is empty.. why you mad?\n\nAnyway, i totally cannot remember what i ate here.."

He doesn't seem to understand that when there is a shooting and lots of other crime in or near his motel, that this will steer people AWAY from his motel.

0,"My wife and I stayed here last year around July. We searched around to find a nice hotel for a few nights that would fit our budget. When we got to the hotel, we notice a lot of police in the area and it looked to be in a bad neighborhood. The room and bed was fine and the hotel did not look run down. We only stayed one night and went back home. Next we will find something better and in a better location."
0,"Not clean, room sure could use a coat of paint and updating."
0,Do not trust this days in. Note on wall saying no refund after 15 mins but out of site so you don't see and takes that long to drive around to room walk up stairs and see the state of the room. No refund given. Rude and unprofessional. \n\nThey take your money.  You don't get to see the room. I asked for non smoking. All I got was a smoking room. Went back and changed and got another smokers room. Came back and got shown a sign on the wall to the side\n\nOUT OF SITE TILL THEY SHOW YOU NO REFUND AFTER 15 mins.  Do not trust this days in. They stole my money. The room is not worth 58 bucks. It's not worth 30 bucks. Ramada hotel Charlotte airport and conference center and for 10 bucks more it's like going from a dumpster to a royal palace. \n\nTake my word. Don't waste your time or money.  And if you don't believing me ask if you can see a room before paying. And I bet they will refuse cause the photos look nothing like the rooms.  Trust and go elsewhere. I lost money. No refund and I have to wait till the money hits my bank and then I get it back but as I am leaving the USA. Well that will take time.  So don't take my word. If they don't let you see. Go else where. Why would they say 15 mins lose refund. Simple. It's that bad!!!!!!!!!! Unprofessional when owner says go to hell to a customer asking for refund!!  I won't even give it one star if I could but I have to
0,Also note they lie when you fight it with your bank.  Sadly I left the country to move back to England so communicating with the bank is so slow this company days in lied to steal money from me when I never stayed there. I actually booked with a better place that was not a **** hole of a place. Trust me. Same price by the airport and your in a luxury.  Don't trust this pace. Unfair 15 mins refund before you even see a room. Rooms are disgusting. Cheap and not worth 25 to 30 dollars including tax and that's being fair.  Owner is well full of him self and cares not about his customers. That's why they hide the 15 mins warning out of plan site. \n\nAny hotel or motel will and should let you see a room before you commit. So don't trust this place and if you want bed bugs. I can bet this place does. Sheets looked old. \n\nBe very careful. Go to better places. Check airport hotels. Same price and so much better.
0,"I had such good luck with Sugar's (across the street), I decided to press my luck.  Did you ever watch that show?  I felt like there was a little voice in my head screaming \""no whammies\"" as I walked through the door, and as soon as I did, this little red devil was jumping up and down laughing, knowing I had gone too far.\n\nWhere the staff at Sugar's is friendly, the staff at Texas Ranch is surly.  They leave the impression that they would rather punch you than serve you, and given the neighborhood you're in, they just might.\n\nThough signs on the outside proclaim breakfast specials for a few bucks ($2.75, if I recall), I don't remember seeing them on the menu, and I think I spent close to $6, just for the food.  After a drink, tax and a tip, I was out closer to $10.\n\nTo make matters worse, the food wasn't that great, it was served only after waiting for a while, and it wasn't exactly what I ordered (my over-medium eggs were scrambled).  I didn't think the staff would be amenable to giving me an updated set of eggs, and I figured the rest of my food would get cold in the process, so I went with it, and my soft drink went empty in the process.\n\nIt's definitely possible that I hit them on a bad day, but I'd much rather brave traffic to get across the street to Sugar's - or even across the bridge to McDonald's or Wendy's (if they start serving breakfast) than go through that again."

0,"Took my boxer there for an annual exam and vaccines. The vet was nice, and when she didn't know the answers about his hair loss she pulled out her big book and checked, which I appreciate, however...\n\nWe wanted to get his nails trimmed. The staff couldn't seem to handle a 60 lb boxer (who was seated), and I had to show them where the quick of his nail was located. He routinely got his nails trimmed, I just don't think they knew what they were doing. Small dogs may be different.\n\nMy BIGGEST issue, and the reason I will tell people to be aware...is because they did (or at least were supossed to) do a full check up on him. They said they did blood work as well as a fecal testing. Well, they missed that he was in end stages of cancer!!! We left there thinking our boxer was healthy, but it was so far from true. He had blood tests, vaccines, the whole work up and in fact was diagnosed with an ear infection. (Which by the way was so ridiculously expensive to diagnose and treat. Then the vet admitted she probably didn't need to swab his ear and run diagnostics (because she could tell just from his wax and smell it was infected) so she basically admitted she ran an unnecessary test.  Between the diagnosis and the meds, it was around $75-$100. I also decided to update his vaccines, and they were triple the price of Pet Smarts mobile vaccine clinic. (Don't forget-- you'll also oay the exam fee too!!)  they wanted me to being him back in a week to recheck his ear...at the tune of $60 fee. I told them I'd call if I felt like the meds failed. For what it's worth, I found the same medication online (with a vet prescription) for around $12. Wow, talk about overhead!! \n\nShortly after our visit, we visited another vet when we felt something was off with our dog. The new vet  told us how the vet at Stoney creek  must have really dropped the ball. Less than 2 months after our visit to Stoney creek animal hospital, we found out that our boxer was in major organ failure from leukemia. This isn't something that happened in those 2 months, based on his symptoms (which I also reported to SCAH) he had been sick for almost several months.\n\nI am not saying  they are the reason we had to put our beloved pet to sleep. I am saying that they are really expensive, push unnecessary testing and vaccines, and apparently aren't thorough during their exam. There is no reason that they shouldn't have caught that he was dying. Had we known his true state if health, we could have started treatment and medication earlier. \n\nThe place is a chain/franchise, you are treated as a number and they just want to suck money out of you. I truly believe that had they done a true exam, we could have made better decisions for our sweet pet. \n\nOur boxer was my first baby and such a beloved member of our family. I write this review over a year later. I am not angry or vengeful to this animal clinic, but I do believe that my boxer received less than acceptable care from this facility."
0,"I have been a client here for 6 years, and the quality has continued to go downhill, while the price has skyrocketed. I love animals, and I have rescued 5 dogs and cats. Every time I go to Stoney Creek, they try to force me to buy exorbitantly priced tests and medications. \n\nDr. Jill Pascarella is rude, condescending, and lacks any empathy for her clients. I literally left the office in tears today after she implied that I don't care about my dog, because I did not want to pay for the same bacterial test that the dog has already had 4 times. She told me that I don't listen, and stormed out of the exam room. This was after waiting 45 minutes past my appointment time while my dog was become increasingly frightened and uncomfortable. \n\nIn total I spent $160 for a 10 min exam and medicines for a simple skin infection. $65 for antibiotics that you can buy at harris teeter for $5.  I was also pressured to buy expensive vet-only food (in case there is a food allergy, but she isn't sure...) and additional expensive allergy tests and medications. Then she told me that I was using the wrong flea and tick treatment (Frontline). Of course, they have a more expensive version there. I will NEVER go back there again."
0,"Very unpleasant experience with this animal hospital. Our dog was having issues with his hind leg when we decided to take him in. The vet barely paid any attention to the things I was trying to tell her about the issue. Felt around on his hind leg and said \""well I don't feel arthritis, and he seems fine now\"". Of course I take him home and over the next two days he still can't even get up.\n\nThe point that bothered me more than anything was that she examined him for probably under 5 minutes, said she didn't see anything wrong, and then that she wanted to do exploratory surgery in his stomach. I'm sorry, she couldn't even say what she thought the issue might be or if there was an issue and decided that the dog needed surgery!? I told her  we definitely weren't going to let her do that without giving us some more insight, at which point her entire mood changed. We asked if there was anything at all she could even recommend for the pain, and she refused to tell us anything. Literally said \""If you aren't going to let me do surgery then there's nothing else I'm going to tell you.\""\n\nReally horrible and sad experience for me and my pup :("
0,"I am extremely disappointed.  I have been going here since November and today was horrible. I left with 2 finger bleeding, 2 nails on crooked and skimpy polish.  I am definitely in search of a new nail salon."
0,"I've given this place so many chances with their food because I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt.. They just kept getting it wrong. The best thing on the menu would probably be the cheese fries, but not because they're particularly good, the rest of the food is just that bad. Any time I've ordered delivery the food has been cold, the driver ignored all instructions, and it's taken about an hour and a half. I'm not sure if they're messing up or if they just don't care. Either way avoid this place. There are LOTS of great wing places in the area, Wing Zone is NOT one of them."
0,Ordered delivery food took two hours and was cold. Wing sauce was spilled all over bag.
0,"My Mother had the unfortunate experience of being there for 6 weeks in rehab. Although the place looks nice, after searching many places this one seemed to be the best, although we were not overly impressed. She needed to get out of the hospital within 2 days.  I have hesitated saying anything ,because  there are some nice employees there. My Mother's experience was one of total neglect. Aside from being served molded bread on several occasions, they would also bring her meal tray, drop it and go, even though she could not even reach the tray. I think the most overwhelming problem is apathy on the part of employees. If it was not for my sister who was there daily, nothing would have been done. As she could not walk during this time, she was wearing protective diapers with a pad on the bed. On several occasions my sister went in and my Mother had been sitting in her urine for several hours. She even got a sore on her back from it. When my sister removed the pad it was so saturated from sitting for several hours that it fell apart. My Mother needed water. She would call someone. They would always tell her they would be right there. Once a nurse came in and said she would be right back. An hour later she called again and asked what happened. They told her that nurse went to lunch. Now, if this was one or two incidences I might not complain, but this was daily. One nurse came in and told my Mom, \""You stink.\"" Those were her exact words. I would like to know what she would think if someone said that to her Mother! Although my Mother needed rehab to walk, she is of sound mind and very with it. My Mother would tell me she would be calling and the nurses would be in the hall laughing and carrying on, not responsive in the least. Total neglect of a patience's needs. When the director was informed, I think he tried to brush it off. We made several complaints during her stay there. We were not asking for any special treatment. We just wanted my Mother to be taken care of with dignity and respect. If you don't have the humanity to work with older people you need to move on to another line of work. They get away with it because they can, that's why they do it. \nPlease don't send your loved ones to this place. They seem nice to your face, but as soon as you leave they have carte blanche to do whatever they want, with obviously no accountability to anyone apparently. It breaks my heart that my Mom was treated this way. No one deserves this!"
0,"My father was in this facility for a short time (3 days).  I can not recommend this facility.  \n\nObservations:\n\n1- Staff seemed preoccupied with weekend planning and other activities outside of the workplace.  \n\n2- Below average sanitation.  \n\n3- Bathroom light was not working upon arrival and was not repaired for 24 hours.  A bit of an issue with physically challenged patients.  \n\n4- Staff did not seem competent in terms of how to operate equipment.  \n\n5- If I had not actively transferred my father, I do not think that he would have been removed from the bed nor taken to the bathroom during this period.  \n\n6- My father did have a bath by PT/OT.  The PT person seemed qualified and was very nice.  \n\n7- Food was average in quality.  \n\nAfter this experience, we promptly moved my father to another facility.  The best move we ever made.  \n\nSince this facility is operated by CMC and has a good rating on the Medicare site, one would think that this was a reasonably good facility.  Moreover, the facility has a prestigious address.  However, my experience was suboptimal."
0,"If it was possible to give no stars.. I would. Have been here several times and am always greeted by the same drone, miserable looking faces of the employees, one of which I think is the franchise owner. We weren't greeted when we entered, then the sandwich maker spoke so little to us you would think it was the worst thing she could possibly doing serving us. No conversation with either employees the entire time there, although not due to lack of effort on our part. We were just simply ignored. Maybe it was because we were the only ones inside the store at the time. But wouldn't that be the best opportunity to speak to your customers? Maybe I'm just crazy but all in all it was a terrible experience but I wasn't surprised. We had actually dreaded going there in first place due the crappy service in the past but it was a craving I couldn't deny. Sat down to very pathetic sandwich with only about 3 slices of meat on each half. Really? For almost 10 dollars? It was a joke. I will never be returning to this franchise again."
0,"Ive been a member of IP for almost two years (even considering it a second home). I put a hold on my membership for the holidays and decided with Grad school that I couldnt afford the membership and really didnt have the time for it. I wrote an email using their contact us form and never heard anything back.\n\nNext thing I know almost two months later they are hitting me with a $172 charge! They did offer to reimburse one month and give me 5 days free initially. I don't think it's considered \""free\"" if I technically already paid for it. The woman who I dealt with said she didnt receieve emails and that I needed to fill out a special form. \n\nI am not sure why I was never contacted when I suddenly appeared to not be paying my membership despite the fact that I had always done so in the past- I never climbed once during this period obviously since I had thought everything was taken care of. \n\nThe woman was unwilling to work with me at all. I did not want to pay for Jan (considering its the 7th) - the month literally just started at least cut me some slack there. The customer service is obviously lacking since I have brought them tons of business in the past ( signed up several friends and my cousin is on team now). \n\nThey did finally agree to take away Dec/Jan fee's but I am still paying about $70 just because they apparently never received my email. Oh and I was also told not to return because I \""hung up.\"" How is that for friendly service?! It was one of the most frustrating calls Ive made in a long time. \n\nI know they have let ex-employees who were fired due to drug related activities continue to climb so I have to feel a bit offended that I am banned. \n\nI will be going to The White Water Center or outdoors for all my climbing kicks. \n\nBe careful if you sign up for a membership- and send emails via your own account so you have copies- I learned a huge lesson here."

0,"***WARNING!!!!!*** THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE!  WHY?  Here it is.  My family and I went to this place Saturday evening based on the reviews here on Yelp and other sites such as Urbanspoon.  4 of us ordered chicken Parmesan, a pretty good yardstick for determining how the food is in any Italian restaurant.  After each of us took our first bite, we all lookedvat each other with the sort of face you make when you are wondering what was that.  The look was followed by universal disdain for this so called meal.  The chicken was inedible , the sauce was nothing resembling tomato sauce found on 99% of all Italian meals.  We should have been tipped off when the chicken was grilled not breaded as is the case with this dish.  BLAND.  GROSS.  TERRIBLE.  Now comes the part that totally caused me to write this.  We sent it all back.  We were asked \""would you like something else?\"".  Not a chance.  If this was the indicator for the so called cuisine we wanted nothing to do with it.  The \""manager\"" came to our table.  \""You have to pay for the entire meal\"".  Seriously?  Seriously!  Now again in 99% of the time when food is returned, the normal proper way of doing business is to say \""sorry you didn't like your food.  We will deduct the cost from your bill\"".  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.  In the face of protecting my family from the embarassment of the police being called, I paid $83 for this CRAP. $83!!!  As I left I suggested the manager change this policy.  It was met with a smirk and defiance.  In the face of my saying the social media world will hear about this, she couldn't care less.  So, here it is. For those of you who gave this place a positive review, I have to ask \""Seriously?\"". For those of you looking for something new in Italian food in Charlotte,YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED by someone who rarely sends food back and by someone who understands the customer is always right."

I am disappointed.  \nWhen I read the reviews I was a little surprised but I figured somehow I must have looked over this place after all these years and I was actually regretting it!  Now...not so much. I quickly realized there was a reason I grew up right around the corner yet never visited this place.  I realized there was a reason I never even stepped foot in this place on a lunch break while working at the neighboring Food Lion as a squeaky teenager with braces. Back then I thought Ragu was gourmet so I wasn't even picky but STILL knew to stay away from Juliana's  There is a reason why our Italian family of 7 never bothered ordering from here even though it was cheap and close by!  You have to realize this was before the restaurant scene really even popped off in Charlotte!! There were no options!  Uptown was downtown, the arboretum was for the wealthy and Ballantyne didn't exist.  But still....Juliana's was never an option....now I see WHY!!\n\nWe opened the door and immediately fell back into 1973.  The diner feel of this place gave me the creeps and the whole restaurant turned to stare as we entered.  It was awkwardly quiet and just didn't have a comfortable feel AT ALL.  I wanted to leave from the moment I stepped in but I figured I needed to get over myself and give it a try.  Sometimes the best food comes out of little hole in the wall restaurants.  I wasn't expecting much but I realize decor is not the only thing that matters.\n\nWe decided to stick with the absolute basic.  I ordered Spaghetti and meatballs and my husband ordered the chicken parm 12 inch sub.  My husband isn't as picky as I am so I was counting on him to enjoy this sub.  It is pretty hard to mess up a chicken parm sub.\n\nMy pasta came out and all I can tell you is that the sauce was brown.  It looked like gravy.  When I mixed it in with the spaghetti it somehow just vanished so it was basically like eating noodles with a hint of brown gravy.  It was the most disgusting thing I have ever tasted.  I took one bite of the meatball and thought I was going to throw up.  It was atrocious.  It was spongey and tasted like deer meat.  It was so gross.  My husband's chicken parm sub had the same doo-doo brown gravy on it and the chicken was like rubber.  Literally.  He could hardly bite through it.  When he said he couldn't eat this sub, I KNEW it was bad.  He eats anything.  I for darn sure wasn't eating my dish so we just sat their staring at each other.  I forgot to mention the salad and texas toast that was served with the meal...the salad was frozen iceburg with nothing else and the toast was a piece of lilly white bread with some butter and garlic slapped on it.  BLLLLEH!!!!\n\nEventually the waitress made her way over to us and we weren't sure what to say but I can tell you I have only not been able to eat a meal due to COMPLETE dissatisfaction twice in my whole life.  The waitress noticed that we didn't eat our meals and asked if we wanted a box to go.  Um, WOW.  No, we want to just get out of here.  We asked for our check and told her we weren't really satisfied but that we didn't want to make a big deal, no need for managers, etc.  Well, one of the \""managers\"" (son to the woman who owns and cooks) came over.  He offered us anything else off the menu to replace our meals.  We didn't want anything else from this dump.  We wanted to just LEAVE and go eat.  We were starving and on a time crunch.  \n\nLong story short--They made us pay for the meal that we didn't even touch.  The owner came out and was extremely nasty.  She said she posted that they do not refund for food.  She then pointed to this itty bitty note on her cash register.  She said she can't please everyone's taste buds so she is not going to refund anyone.  What?  So does this happen often enough that you have to have a disclaimer on your food?  That is TERRIBLE servie for a small mom and pop, or just mom shop.  It was like they were used to people not liking their food so they were prepared to argue their point.  IT was bizarre.  I don't understand that concept.  They said you can order a pizza or something else so they are still losing money by having to make a whole other meal!  Either way, it was their approach and the fact that the food was absolutely disgusting.  I would NEVER want to support this place, local or not.\n\nI asked them where they were from because no one that was born and raised in Italy would have created the mess that they did.  They were actually greek.  I suppose they just have a different way of preparing Italian food because it was NOT authentic.\n\nI looked back at those who offered such stellar reviews and realized that most of the people were from random towns/areas.  Maybe they haven't been exposed to the real deal in terms of Italian food so somehow this place was okay to them.  Not me.  I'm telling you...If you love Italian food and have had real authentic Italian food...DO NOT GO HERE.  End of story"
0,"This is the most horrible dry cleaners I have ever experienced.  They completely destroyed a $200 shirt and just lost another silk blouse.  Throwing away your clothes would be easier than driving to this dry cleaner, dealing with rude service, and not getting your clothes back in the condition you gave it to them, or just not getting your clothes back at all.  They change their hours at will without updating their website to inform their customers, so you drive all the way out there after a long day at work, and find the doors locked without even an apology.  Very unprofessional... the worst ever!"
0,"NEVER GO HERE! TAKE YOUR BISS. ELSEWHERE! THESE PEOPLE RIP YOU OFF! I just moved into the area looking for a dry cleaners. This one was close to my home but by far the worst experience i ever had. I brought my work shirts in and handed them to the woman to look at to give me a direct price. She looked at my shirts. I also had one apron, a sun dress and to 2 pair of jeans to be repaired. The first woman i delt with told me one price but when I came in to pick up my order. My shirtsand aprons still had the stains on them. I could have done a better job with some oxy clean, Reason i didnt was bc i didnt want to have to go through that. So now the woman tells me double the price then what the first woman said to me and didnt want to help me on there mistake! Then the jeans for repair she tells me it would cost me at most 7 dollars a pair of pants to get repaired! The other woman tell me i owe 16 dollars a pair! DOUBLE THEN WHAT I WAS TOLD! She said they needed to be cleaned? so you just add on services because its what you think and just charge them for the service! I was charged double for every piece of clothing. I asked for a manger it was the of course her! so i wanted to speak to someone else higher and she refused to give me any kind of contact with them? needless to say i had to pay way more then what i was told and when i was in there she kept pushing me aside to help other customers when I was there first and a PAYING customer too! Totally Unprofessional the way this biss is run! GO ELSEWHERE TRYING TO SAVE YOU FROM A NIGHTMARE AT THE DRY CLEANERS!!!"
0,"I did business with this cleaners about every week for over 15 years. I recently left a custom made - $175 men's dress shirt for cleaning. The shirt is one year old but like new. Somehow, in the cleaning process, the shirt got stained to the point that it is now unwearable. Springfresh took two weeks to offer a small store credit and $25, which was unacceptable. I do not recommend them and will not go back."
0,"I took my cat here this past weekend for a bath and to have her claws clipped.  I was not happy at all.  I specifically told them when I dropped off my cat that I did not want her fur trimmed at all.  When I picked her up I was told that they trimmed her sanitary area.  Trimmed...yeah right!  They shaved half of her belly.  There was absolutely no reason for that.  She was not dirty in her private areas.  Not only was she shaved but it was all crooked with tufts of hair sticking out on the sides.  I didn't see this until we got home since she was in the crate when I picked her up.  I called back to complain.  They told me to bring her in again and they would fix it.  100 degrees and back we go to the groomer.  They took her in the back and \""fixed it\"".  Then they offered me a $5.00 discount on my next visit.  It's still not right.  They straightened out the line but now the whole thing is at an angle.  It looks ridiculous.  The groomer who shaved my cat needs to have her eyes checked.  For someone who does this for a living she did a pretty pathetic job.\n\nThe place is also pretty old, not very well maintained and dirty.  I wonder if the groomers know that everyone in the waiting area can hear all their gossiping they are doing while they are working.\n\nNeedless to say....It was not a good experience and I will not be going back there."
0,This location is no longer open.
0,Terrible customer service.  Watch out!  I agree they are an unethical company.  I was with them for 10 years. I called to cancel my service months before the actual cancel date and the not so friendly customer service rep said I owe 90 days per an agreement back in 2002.  They dismissed my original cancel notice and said I have to pay at least 30 days more!!!  And she was doing me a favor and hung up on me!!!
0,"I inherited a Muzak account from the previous business owner.  I couldn't believe that anyone would pay over $100 a month for this crappy service.  Every time the wind would blow we would lose the connection to the dish on the roof.  $300+ service fee for some guy to drive 4 hours to fix it.  Unbelievably poor service and super expensive on top of that.   I immediately canceled the service only to to told that there was some 60 month contract of  which I or the previous owner had never seen..........I'll let my lawyer handle that one.  \n\nIf you are using Muzak, I recommend you get out ASAP.   Sirius satellite service is only $25 a month and even better is their internet radio for $35 a month and both have much better selection, and you can make the changes on the fly.  \n\nAn even better option and the one I went with was Pandora DMX business service.  It is only $25 a month and you can tailor make the music to suit your needs, changing the stations is easy, and the system is programmable to allow you to set schedules, etc..  Much more feature reach than anything that crappy Muzak offers and less than 25% of the cost for me."
0,"Please business owner, stay away from Muzak , I had a really bad e experience with this company, first is very expensive , second when u have a problem you have to wait 40 minutes or more for somebody respond , after you wait so long their customer services is horrible , they cant help you,  and they told you somebody going to call u back because we don't know how to help you, after that no body call you back after they told you.  I called another company and I find the same service for 56.00 a month and I was paying to Muzak 250.00 a month the is a big difference , after that a traying to cancel my contract with muzak, And the was very rude with me, And after that they send me a email, that said they i have to pay them 6900.00 for the next 38 month , they loose their mind , they want me to pay for nothing , they service is horrible and rude people, and very expensive they only reason they a stay with them because the prior owner have a contract with the but I can keep paying so much for a poor service and very expensive month fee , I have to send my case to my lawyer ..\nPlease , please stay away from Muzak you can find a better company and service for a LESS  money.  One start because I don't have choice, I would give them cero start if a could.."
0,"This company's contract is very frustrating to work with. I signed a 60 month (5Year) contract and in their fine print, if you don't notify them within 90 days of the end of the 60 month contract, they automatically re-sign you for another 60 months.  I have used them for 8 years but they still want more money out of me.  I pay $71.28 for a cassette tape player. I can not speak directly with my sales rep, at least she is willing to send me an email. I did get her name from someone on the 800 number I was directed to call if I had questions about the \""nominal rate increase\""...again. I am still working on canceling service."
0,You should check out PlayNetwork.com.  Great customer service with a ton of service options that won't break the bank.
0,"I have been working with Muzak for nearly 7 years, and just his year their service has went from amazing to crap.\n\nAt the resort where I work we had some construction going on starting in May.  Due to the construction the satellite for our Muzak player was obstructed so we could not get signal.  We were aware that this was the issue and were notified by the tech that once the construction was over he could come back out and get us back up and running.  \n\nI called on 7/16 to get a tech to come back out as our work was over and we were starting to get busy again and needed the lobby music and the ambient music to begin working again.  The girl on the phone said it would be 24-48 hours and someone would call us to let us know an ETA.  No call came.  Given that was a Thursday I realized that because it stretched into the weekend we may not get our service until Monday.  Monday came and went and still nothing.  I called back a few days later and was told that our area was backed up and it would be taken care of on 7/25.  The day came and went and still no tech.  Not even a follow up call as to why.  I called back 7/26 and was told by Chris that he would reach out to the tech to see why he never showed up and that someone would call me to update me.  Still nothing.  I called back this morning and was told that since it was the weekend the tech isn't working, which is completely different than what Chris told me the day prior, and that he felt like someone would definitely be here tomorrow, Monday.  \n\nI'm understanding that things happen, but it seems like they would be willing at least to give us a call and keep us in the loop as to why it has now been 12 whole days since my first service call and they can't get someone out here.  \n\nIf I had to recommend any music service at all for your business it would definitely not be this one."
0,"Not good at all.  I was there at 10:40, supposedly they open at 10:30, ordered food, asked at 10 to 11 if I could at least have my tea, the lady very rudely told me they had just opened and didn't have tea yet?  Finally brought my tea, I told her I did not want ice which she ignored, brought the wonton egg drop soup, very greasy, had chicken fried rice, which was very dry, even tried putting some of the soup on top of it."
0,"I could not use the pay at the pump feature with a credit card. I tried twice and eventually had to hang up the pump and drive away. The display screens were cracked , and practically unreadable in the sunshine. There were pumps that were out of order. I will not be stopping here again for gas even though the prices were cheap. That doesn't do you a lot of good if you can't pump the fuel."
0,"Ordered for delivery..giving the information was painful. The person on the other line had an attitude and had trouble coping the information. I don't think I could have spoken any slower. I was told 35 min. Well 35 turned into 55. That extra 20 is an eternity when you have 3 hungry boys under 6yo. When I called back to see where it was I was again greeted with an attitude. Pleasant..right? Well we got to pizza, and it was cold. NEVER again. I'm going back to Danny's."
0,"I love Bojangles, and it is nice to have one close to home, BUT every single time I try to go to this location and either dine in or go through the drive-thru I have received horrible service. For some reason it always seems like they only have 2 people working, the line inside and out is wrapped around the building, and more times than not- the order is incorrect. I will now go out of my way to find a better equipped location to enjoy my chicken."
0,We ordered from them mid day during the week for delivery.  It took 2 hours and our pizza was cold.  We were told by the manager that they would give us a free pizza.  We called back a few days later to order and there was no record of the incident.\n\nWe will never return.
0,"Slow, dirty, out of the \""wrap\"" for the wraps, kids running wild all over and have been waiting 15 mins for my food. I will never come back. I don't expect high quality food, but there are much better locations elsewhere."
0,"I sorry but when you serve my child apples that are two days past The expiration date you get one stars, it should be none. I noticed half thur her eating them. Then when I write in I get some generic email about sorry we didn't meet your expectations.  No you didn't meet the health departments expectation or mine. Beware!"
0,"I come (or should I say USED to come) to this particular McDonalds about once every three months for three years because of the convenience of the location. It's hard to screw up fast food to this level, especially for a huge, international company where you have low expectations to begin with. This particular store sets the bar to a new low. I will never be back. The staff teams are consistently rude or passive, the food is thrown together sloppily, and the place is almost always a mess. Things like a drive thru that always takes longer than most, the trash cans inside are usually full,  and the best indicator of bad management - the bathroom is disgusting. I'll keep on driving to a another one next time as I am sure it can't be worse than this one at the corner of Gold Hill Rd and SC hwy 160."
0,"I booked this hotel on Hotwire and what a bust.  First, the area is sketchy at best.  I couldn't even take my dog out to use the bathroom without being hit on or asked for money.  The hotel is very noisy because the walls are paper thin.  They do although pets with a $25 pet fee but that is the only redeeming quality about this place.  Although it is close to Carowinds I would never stay here with my children.  If you are thinking about staying here I would reconsider."
0,"Stinky, black mold on peeling wall paper, peeling gross paint all over hotel room door. Scary place."
0,"worst Mexican I've had... and I like the standard Tex Mex that usually all tastes the same and seems like it must be easy to get right, but I couldn't even eat this.  it's a holiday so maybe the staff wasn't the usual but beyond that even the chips weren't good, the taco shells were stale, the ladies room smelled like a dirty kitchen and the food was overall flavorless.  I never send food back (didn't tonight either) but I almost feel like I should have given them some feedback... thus the review.  oh yea the service was odd... the waitress didn't even ask us if we were ready to order. She just gave us a look... even if she didn't speak english she could have smiled or something."
0,"This is the second time that I have been here, and both times were terrible. I typically enjoy the standard \""tex-mex\"" type restaurants, but this was a pretty poor example of the style.\n\nLike most of these places the experience starts with chips and salsa; this salsa was bland and watery. The chips were cold and stale; not sure when they made them, but I'm sure that it was not the day they served them to us... At this point I should have left and drove up the road to Azteca, Don Pedro or any of the other taco shacks the Queen City has to offer; but sometimes I am not so sharp so we proceeded to order lunch.\n\nI ordered the chimichanga; now usually a chimichanga is a flour tortilla filled with a wide range of seasoned flavorful ingredients and deep fried until it is a golden brown color and slightly crispy on the outside. This thing was filled with bland, unflavorful, grayish colored \""shredded beef\"" and was soggy, they then smothered it in some sort of unseasoned canned tomatoes that they tried to pass off as salsa, I assume to mask the lack of flavor in the dish itself. On the side was some wilted lettuce with sour cream and something that vaguely resembled guacamole, and some oily rice that was nearly as flavorless as the rest of the meal. Phenomenal. I managed to eat about a quarter of this flavorless, oily, soggy train wreck before I gave up and threw in the towel. \n\nWhen the server finally came back around several minutes later, she acted like she didn't even notice that none of us had eaten more than half of their meal, and quietly picked up the plates and brought us our checks. None of us were asked how our meal was, if everything was OK, if we wanted any desert or more chips and salsa, and none of us received a refill on our drinks.\n\nAll in all, this was one of the worse restaurant prepared meals that I have had the pleasure of experiencing. Kudos to the good folks at El Cancun"
0,"Skip. The Enchiladas are like a bad day at a sewage treatment plant. A revolting brown sauce, inedible beef, fake cheese, and a bizarre flavor that leaves one gagging. The rice is flavorless and the chips (which came with the meal) taste days old. Hey at least the canned refried beans can't be screwed up."
0,"Very disappointed,  I grew up in Texas and lived in Tex-Mex.  the enchilada sauce had a very weird taste.  I couldn't even finish it."
0,"If you are thinking about hiring Kuester to manage your property, think again. This company will under service and overcharge you. Their management will not return phone calls if you have a complaint, but will continue to have underlings placate you with vague answers to your complaints or concerns.  If you have already hired them, you may want to revisit your contract to make sure you understand what they can do to you. You may be surprised."
0,"Run, fast! We could not get out from under Kuester fast enough. Being on the HOA board is difficult enough but then you throw in incompetent management and its even worse! Ben and Deb are masters at nickel and diming your association to death. We were double charged every single time we had to mail something, once in 'Postage' and once in 'Office Supplies. Whenever we asked a question pertaining to any account they would always reply, \""I will have to get back to you\"" It became a running joke they said it so often. We used to have to send multiple emails, and when I say multiple I mean over a dozen just to get the answers we were promised. We also had so many complaints from our fellow neighbors who would call them and never get anything resolved. Kuester's reply? \""We don't show any calls\"" I understand that some people may not always tell the truth but come on! We are talking about a good 40 different homeowners all saying the same thing..  I left the board because I moved and was so very happy not to have to deal with them again, but NO! They charged me $130 on my closing statement just to send a statement to the closing attorney showing I was up to date on my dues. How messed up is that? And I bet you they also DOUBLE  charged for the postage. Do yourself a favor and save yourself the headaches, stay FAR away from Kuester!"
0,"If I could give this company a zero rating, I would.  Dealing with this management company is just a nightmare.  Our hallways, stairwells, and foyer have not been swept and mopped in months.  Our garbage shoot is backed up to our floor, which is the second floor.  It has caused a rodent problem, not only in the trash area, but in each unit.  We were watching television the other night when we heard a squeaking sound.  We looked up and there was a mouse on the ledge overhanging our twelve foot ceiling.  Just disgusting!  Who wants to have to worry about rodents and garbage overflowing in the garbage shoot.  I and others have called multiple times to get the place swept and the trash and dust bunnies just keep piling up.  It is starting to look like a housing project and the property is approximately five years old.  DO NOT USE THIS MANAGEMENT PROPERTY OR YOU WILL BE SORRY!!!!"
0,"The nickel and dime comment from Paul is spot on.  I've been sent letters and charged for cleaning siding twice and the work was done and a message left for Kuester with no return call.  I have neighbors with terrible looking yards, dirty siding, and others but they never receive a notice so this is personal for some reason.  I've always paid my dues in advance and also cut grass for a vacant house beside me regularly but they still nickel and dime.  If you have a choice STAY AWAY!  Oh yea I even took proof into show the siding was cleaned with a date stamp on the cleaning and nothing was done!"
0,"I just happened to go to the Shell gas station and my son said he wanted wendy's to eat. Now we dont normally eat out often but today I said ok. We got the gas, walked in wendys and instantly I saw how filthy the restaurant was. Then I walked in further towards the cash register and there was this aweful smell. We automatically turned around and walked out the restaurant. My first time there and this was an aweful experience and I will not eat there again. They need to work on keeping the place sanitary especially being a good place...."
0,Had dinner here last night.  Service was pleasant and efficient.  Eggplant Parm was SALTY.  Veal Parm was tough and so thin.  Maybe 1/16 inch?  The breading was thicker than the veal.  At least the veal wasn't the pressed type.  Will probably not go back except perhaps to try the pizza.
0,"I will not return, terrible customer service. I ordered a pizza from here because I had received a \""welcome\"" packet with some coupons including one for Demarco's giving a free large 1 topping pizza, dine in or take out. I called and ordered then went to pick it up, upon doing so the hostess told me the owner wasn't accepting these coupons and it's only good with a $40 or something purchase (the coupon was newly received so this wasn't news to the owner he just didn't pull them per the hostess which seems like a scam to me). I politely argued with the girl telling her it doesn't give stipulations anywhere and that's false advertising (not even sure if that's legal?) and very poor customer service for which they would lose customers (like myself). She understood but it was the owners call. I ended up purchasing the pizza (needed to eat!) and the pizza wasn't good. It had too much cheese and hardly any sauce and it was burnt. Because I'm pregnant I opted not to get too stressed so after stating my views I left vowing that I wont return. Which is unfortunate because it's very close to my home but there are too many other places close enough with better food and certainly better service!"
0,Only people in the place and the waitress messed up a simple order. Chili verde was ok but not worth $11. Husband had chicken & cheese enchiladas and said they were bland.
0,"I'm so over T-Bones.\n\nI used to relish the thought of hanging out on their big deck on one of the first warm days of the year, treating myself to their yummy grilled chicken salad or wings--the only 2 things on their menu that I liked.  I was even willing to tolerate the funky smell of the main restaurant on my way out to the deck.  But the last 3 times I've been to T-Bones, the food and service have been awful.  And they changed the menu, removing the grilled chicken breast salad that I liked.  The sweet tea was almost as clear as water, and painfully sweet--undrinkable.\n\nI'm sorry, T-Bones.  We tried to make it work, but it takes two.  Please stop relying on the fact that you're the only place (I know of) in the area where you can eat the water's edge.  It's just not enough to keep us coming anymore.  You actually have to serve good food and decent drinks."
0,"T-Bones is well below average. Starting with the drinks. Tea was very weak and the glasses were very small. Appetizer, hot wings, were mediocre at best. Not hot and sorta greasy. Wife got salad, which was unimpressive and a little wilted. Wife had filet, which she described as  a poor cut of meat, tough with gristle. I got a ribeye, if you could call it that. It appeared to be pan fried, as is was greasy. It was a very poor cut of meat, with much fat and gristle. Sweet potato was good, except it was very small. \n  Service was good, as we were in a group of 12.  Glasses were kept full and service prompt. Cost is hard to believe! You pay for a choice cut of meat and get Waffle House food. \n I went to this place probably 15 years ago. Was not impressed then. Has gotten worse. Not inclined to go to places were they have to have armed police officers on duty for the protection of their patrons.   This placed is off the list. Will not return!"
0,"Service was good, but food NOT.  You don't realize how awful the food really is until about 30 minutes after you have eaten it.  5 of us eat there tonight, we each had different items, pasta, fish and chips, potato skins, combination of vegetable sides, a sandwich, and other items.   Everything was GREAZY and salty.  But you don't realize how much grease until 15-30 minutes after eating when your skin gets oily, you feel sludgy, thirsty, and loose your energy.  I don't know what grease or ingredients they use, but it's terrible.  We all went home after and didn't feel like doing anything after this.\nI've been there before for beer on the deck, the beer is good, but don't eat the food.  \nContrary to many of the other reviews, the service was very good.  Meghan was our waitress."
0,"Unfortunately this is the only place on Lake Wylie to eat when you are out on your boat other than a snack bar. The deck and the boat docks are the only reason they are still in business. If you want a drink order beer or wine. The drinks are watered down and shots are limited because the premium liquor selections are limited.  The food leaves a lot to be desired.  We ordered the smoked chicken quesadilla, mozzarella cheese sticks and a burger because we thought it would be hard to mess that up. We were wrong.  The chicken had some artifical smoke flavor added and that was the only flavor.  The filling ingredients were not evenly distributed so there were areas overloaded and areas with nothing. The cheese sticks were a lukewarm frozen product, the marina was much hotter and appears to be a frozen product nuked in little cups because the plastic was melting.  The hamburger was not seasoned and mediocre.  The fries were mushy and limp.   On top of all this the place appears grungy and dated.  The place is falling apart and obviously being run into the ground in an attempt to just milk every possible dime out of it. This is the last chance we are giving this place.  Hopefully everyone will also give up on it so a decent place can be moved in, but I think the building is beyond saving at this point."
0,"I never realized how gross this place was, until I went sober with a group of 13 from work. Yes, it is great to be on the lake, but the place needs some major renovations. The inside smells horrible... like old and soggy and dusty. I ordered a salad with salmon which was disgusting. I think the salmon took on the flavor of the smell of the inside which was nasty. I have enjoyed the chicken quesadilla and drinks before, but that's about it. Actually, I forgot, their Sunday brunch is pretty good and they do a bloody Mary bar that is good too. Don't take a large group because they act like accommodating you is painful. They also took forever when the restaurant seemed fairly dead. They need to remodel and hire a new chef to re-write the menu because you cannot beat the location. They also need more boat slips... it always fills up fast on the weekend!"
0,"Great atmosphere and location, but the food is sad, just sad. Won't be coming back. It's fine if you want to enjoy a few beers by the water, but don't come hungry."
0,Food and decor are horrific. Only redeeming factor is its location; well that and the fact that it's closed 8 hours a day.....
0,"I feel as though I needed to write this review. This is just tragic that such a prime  location on the lake has terrible food, service, and if that isn't enough, even their drinks are so so...live in town and never been happy with the food. Only up is the location!!! Do not waste $$ on food!! I have had \nRibs: too soft and drenched in BBQ sauce\nFish sandwich: fish sticks.. Brown lettuce \nHamburger: dry bun, no flavor..\nWings: the worst, slimy \n\nAnd others as well.. \n\nYou've been warned!!\n\nBest and only thing is good music, nice deck w water views and drinks on a summer night or day.. Live music is fun.. Awesome for hanging out w drinks.. Not a food place"
0,"Disappointed! Menu looked good but very expensive. The food was average. I can see no justification for their prices. Our main entrees were delivered to the table before our appetizer and salads. I can understand having problems if it's busy but it wasn't. I'm very disappointed in everything about this restaurant. We won't be coming back unless we have to, and if we do, we'll make sure we eat somewhere else first."
0,"This is the worst example of a \""Steakhouse\"" ever.  The owner is a self righteous fool that loves to cause trouble if you give feedback.  Lousy place on Lake wylie, sc"
0,We have been going to TBones on the Lake for years.  We live on Lake Wylie so it is a nice boat ride.  The reviews I read about the cleanliness is right on. Tonight was the worst in service and food.  The kid that waited on us got our order incorrect.  My fish and chips came without the chips.  I had ordered slaw as an extra side.  The slaw came and was awful. I was afraid to eat a lot of it.  My fries came after we were pretty much through eating.  They tasted like they had been cooked in burnt grease.  Then he charged me for them.  We always leave a great tip because we know how hard it is to be a server but tonight my husband left a tip saying  bad service ; bad tip. This place needs renovation and cleaned up desperately.  Some of the best flounder I have ever eaten used to come from here.  I am sad to see it go down hill.   We also had a family near us that couldn't control their kids and I think they thought we were at a McDonalds Play land. Tonight was a miserable time here. We will probably come back home to eat from now on when going on a boat ride.
0,Ok.  I try this place 2 or 3 times a year praying it will get better.   I live i n the lake and its the only place to go if your out for a boat ride.  Without fail its always the same.   Dirty.... I'm looking at a spider web hanging from a moose head as I write this.   Sloooow service.   Poor to standard food.  If it wasn't for the monopoly of being on the lake they would be out of business.
0,"After reading other reviews, I'm glad I'm not the only one who has experienced the bad food and service.  I've been there twice, both times it took some effort to get served.  Today was the worst, though.  My husband got to the table first and ordered his drink. When my daughter and I sat down, it was several minutes before we got any attention from the server.  We then (finally) were able to order drinks - I ordered a Bushwacker, but got what I think was a terrible Pina Colada instead.  I couldn't drink it, so terrible, so I sent it back and ordered a beer.  Finally got menus after asking.  Ordered an app (the Filet Bites, actually really awesome) but once it was brought to the table, asked our server twice for silverware and then had to go up and get it ourselves.  Ordered a bacon cheeseburger and rack of ribs for dinner. My daughter loved the ribs, the cheeseburger was minus the bacon, but otherwise not bad.  \n\nWhen I asked our server to remove the charge for the bacon and the drink I had sent back, she said she could take off the bacon ($1) but not the drink without asking the manager.  \n\nI don't think I'll go back there, unless it is by boat for a quick beer and the view."
0,"On a whim tonight, we decided to try T-Bones. I've driven by many times, and the location, right on the lake, looks very nice.  You can tell from the general exterior decor that this place was probably last remodeled back in 1975.... but I'm not going to pass judgement on that. As we all know, sometimes places like this can have excellent food, be quite charming, and a good time.\n\nSince it's November, it was dark, and there of course was no outside seating.... no boats bobbing in the water... so other than a nice clear night with glassy water in the moonlight, there was not much to see. We did get seated at a very nice window seat, thanks to the hostess, who had orders barked to her by the \""manager\"", who resembled a female version of Jabba The Hut from Star Wars... I felt bad for the hostess.\n\nI think the food was very good.... I had the Fantail Shrimp, our son a burger, and my wife the Gorgonzola/Walnut stuff chicken. We had an appetizer of the stuffed mushrooms. As far as the food goes, the mushrooms were probably really the only letdown of the evening.... slightly over-priced and underwhelming.... the gravy they were sitting in left much to be desired..... not terrible..... but not $9.95 appetizer good.....  ya know???\n\nInitially, when we sat, our server greeted us promptly, which I thought was great. Sadly, this was the only server-like action she took for the rest of the evening. After bringing our drinks, and taking our order, she was not to be seen again until after the main course had been delivered. My drink was empty, my wife's water was empty... she had wanted to order a beer. When our server finally did stop by, she did not ask about our food.... but at least we were able to order more drinks. When my wife asked what beer was on tap, she had no idea..... and didn't really seem to care to have an idea.\n\nI noticed that our server would disappear for long periods of time. In the time it took her to come out once, the server in the next section had made the rounds 4-5 times.... making sure everyone was ok, filling sodas/waters, etc. We were left sitting, alone.\n\nWhen we were finally done, she came to get plates. There were a few, since of course she hadn't been around to gather anything through the course of dinner. Since she couldn't take them all, she left a stack of dirty plates on our table - disgusting.  \n\nAt that point, I laid down 4 crisp $20's for our $75-ish tab, and we got the heck outta there...... as we departed the \""manager\"" (Jabba The Hut) wished us good night in a very un-caring tone, and we noticed upon leaving the dinner specials - not mentioned to us by our server at all!!!!  Absolutely terrible.\n\nSo.... this place could be a solid 3-ish.... IF you get a good server... and if it's summer, and you sit outside, and it's nice..... you might hit a 4.  Again, our main courses we ordered were pretty good.... but with the poor service, our dinner basically sucked."
0,"Certainly will not be back! Disgustingly filthy and the decor is atrocious to say the least. By the time I left and by the way my stomach felt, I was afraid I was going to be the next dusty cob-web covered taxidermy victim on the wall. The food was pretty bad...frozen dry potato skins that tasted like they were made back in the summer and microwaved. Roast beef sandwich that was basically 3 or 4 pieces of processed store bought roast beef on a roll with cheese and grilled onions and peppers (clearly frozen prior to grilling). The French fries were undercooked and even the iced tea had a nasty taste as if their tea container hadn't been cleaned in months. After refusing to finish any of the meal, I had to rush to the bathroom with bad stomach cramps. Having grown up on the Chesapeake Bay and experiencing so many great waterfront resteraunts I had high hopes for this place. It could be so much better. \n\nPLEASE, if nothing else, clean that place before someone really gets sick! Probably one of the filthiest dining rooms I have seen in a long time. Really makes me wonder how dirty the kitchen is. The owners and managers can't be so blind not to see the decades worth of dust and cob-webs on all the junk and dead carcasses located throughout this place.\n\nReluctant to even give this place 1 star! Time for \""Kitchen Nightmare\"" intervention maybe?\n\nUPDATE.....\nOkay, it now 7 hours after my not so tasty (questionably safe) lunch at T-Bones today and my stomach is still doing flip-flops even after a bout of diarrhea (sorry to give such detail but important to note). The health department really needs to take a much closer look at this place...honestly folks!"
0,"Meh, at best.  We were seated immediately but it took our server 7 minutes to acknowledge we were there.  The queso dip was cold & thick.  The food was very mediocre.  I will never spend another dime here."
0,"This was the worst Mexican food I've ever had!! First off ordered a margarita came to the table looking very weak and it tasted even worse I had to send it back! I decided to just go with a draft beer which is very hard to screw up. They give you free chips with salsa the salsa was nothing special either no kick, then came the enchiladas I ordered one word Terrible too much cheese on top, shredded chicken with no flavor inside and not one decimal of spice! The service was slow and prices were way too high for this place! The only thing positive I have to say is the cervaza was cold"
0,"I had a fraxel treatment done here to remove some hyperpigmentation.  Along with the $1000 treatment (and this was 5 years ago), I also had to purchase the Obagi Nu Derm system.  I was told that the treatment felt \""tingly\"" and that I would experience some \""bronzing\"" afterwards- like a mild sunburn, but that I would be just fine by Monday (treatment was on a Friday).  \n\nFirst of all, the treatment felt like they were rolling a rolling pin covered in hot needles all over my face.  Anyways, I went home, washed my face with the appropriate product, put on some ice, and slept with my head elevated per their instructions.  \n\nThe next morning my face felt like orange peel and was so swollen I couldn't even open one eye.  I was completely unrecognizable.  Over the next few days my skin started massively peeling and crusting.  It was excrutiating to smile, chew, talk, etc.  I wiped away built up scabbing with sterile water and used antiobiotic ointment on the open wounds, but other than that I could not/would not touch my face- the exfoliating and bleaching obagi system was out of the question.  Eventually my face healed, but I couldn't go out in public for almost a week.\n\nThe kicker? After all that, the treatment didnt work at all.  The hyperpigmentation came back worse than ever.  Of course, when I complained I was informed that this was actually my fault for not following their recommended skin care regimen.  6 months later I went to a dermatologist who prescribed triluma.  1/10th the cost, very little irritation, and it actually worked."
0,"I was dining here with my boyfriend when I was served chili and mac with HAIR wound into my fork. I had barely taken 3 bites when I noticed this, and the manager, Debbie, FLAT OUT-REFUSED TO COMPENSATE - Neither my boyfriend or I approached her in an uncivil manner - I simply asked to not be charged for the food which I had barely taken a few bites out of and found hair in! I was running short on time and did not have the time to wait around for another 15 minutes for them to give me more food with hair in it. Even though I had barely eaten she absolutely refused to simply not charge me for the hair-food which I had been served. When we called back later to speak to a manager, the same manager from earlier picked up and tried to insist that she could help and that we didn't need to speak to her superiors, and then simply said that she didn't know when or how we could get in contact with a store manager when we insisted - incredibly rude and unhelpful. To reiterate I was CHARGED FULL PRICE FOR FOOD WITH HAIR IN IT WHICH WAS NOT EVEN 1/4 EATEN, AND TOLD THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO. We used to eat there a lot but never, ever again will I eat here! It is the absolute worst service I have ever received, and the only place that the manager has acted irritated when consulted with a problem like hair in the food. I would never recommend this restaurant."
0,"Went here for lunch with two co-workers, checked Yelp before we went and the reviews were very positive so we decided to give it a try.\n\nYikes! How can the reviews be 4-5 stars and the service at best \""average\"", the food was terrible and myself and my co-workers all agreed, this restaurant doesn't rate two stars.\n\nI had one of the special Friday offerings, Smelt. It came with a salad (very average but fresh), fries (ordinary) and the Smelt. After a 20-25 minute wait our server came with our orders. I looked at my plate and was shocked! There was 12-15 so-called Smelt about 3\"" long and deep fried. They looked like little fat cigarettes! I bit into one and it was all batter, I tried another and it was the same. I had deep fried batter for lunch!!\nI haven't had a meal this bad since I got out of the Navy! \n\n My co-workes meals were not much better, one had Chicken Fried Steak and he said it was made out of the box. My other co-worker had the Cod and he said it was mushy and brown colored! YUK! \n\nI hate to write such a negative review but this restaurant earned \""one\"" star. Maybe they have great breakfast! I hope they do because their lunches are sub-par. \n\nThere are other restaurants on this street/highway, I'd give them a try before I stopped here. I know my co-workers and I won't be coming back."
0,"This is a sorry excuse for a grocery store, and it stinks that it's all we have in De Fo. The redheaded stepchild of the Copps family, this Pick N Save can always be relied upon for brown, slimy produce, generally rotten selection, and long check out lines. If I have shopping that involves any serious produce, I head to Sun Prairie. I mean, any store where you find LETTUCE and BROCCOLI in various stages of wilt--seriously, this is basic stuff, folks!!!!--has no justification for being in existence. The other day I grabbed the only remaining spaghetti squash in the store and neglected to notice (as did the checkout person) that one entire side was completely soft and rotten. I guess spaghetti squash is EXOTIC for these parts, but STILL. I've decided that the produce department's MO is to either sell the stuff or wait until it dissolves into sludge. Preferably evaporating afterward. \n\nAs an added bonus, the ethnic section is a joke. \n\nCan we PLEASE have a new grocery store already????"
0,They charge more than the services they provide are worth.  Since they currently have a monopoly on cable tv in the madison area there is nothing anyone can do about it.
0,there should be a negative rating on here.  one star is way to high.\ni am sick and tired of how the cable box is never working their solution? KEEP RESETTING THE BOX... YES IT IS MY JOB TO MAKE SURE I GET MY SERIVCE ON A DAILY BASIS.  IT'S NOT THEIRS TO MAKE SURE IT WORK.  Plus they have poor customer service but I don't blame the people that answer the phones but the people who st the rules to nickel and dime it's customers. \n\ncharter is horrible and since i coudn't get thru to complain on the phone here is my truth.  Charter is the worst.
0,"Used Charter for a couple of years. Just ditched them and I couldn't be happier. Shortly after we first started with Charter our connection went out, took them days to send someone out and it turned out they'd disconnected us for no reason at all. Thanks Charter. Fast forward to the recent past when our bill went up, I called up to try and get a new promotional rate because I'm no paying $60 for internet that bombs out briefly a couple times a day. They said they couldn't do anything better than their listed rate. \nAfter that I decided to downgrade to their lowest speed for the time being in order to save some money. When I called up to do so they transferred me to retentions and magically they offered me a better rate. Turned out they were lying and there was an additional charge on top of that because I wasn't bundling serviced (I have no interest in rotting my brain out watching cable TV or having a phone that I can't take with me in my pocket), when I complained and asked for the original rate the supervisor did not apologize and said the last person I talked to must have assumed I knew about the extra fee. When I told her I wanted the original rate she said there was nothing she could do, what is the point of having a retentions department if the best they can do is what is listed on the website?\nFinally I organized DSL with AT&T which was simple and easy and did not require a visit for installation. I just plugged the DSL modem in and called customer service who guided me through the set up. When I called to cancel with Charter they offered me the original rate but I'm pretty sure it would have been the same thing again. After calling to disconnect I got several calls from Charter trying to get my business back if perhaps they offered me a really good rate but by that point they'd managed to blow whatever shred of credibility they had left in my mind. Since I don't trust their billing practices I had no interest in continuing business with them any longer and am now much happier for it!"
0,"I signed up for Yelp solely so I could post a review of Charter. That is how much I hate them. \n\nIf you are new to Madison and you don't live downtown - go with someone else. If you are living downtown, sorry, like me, you're probably stuck with Charter. \n\nI have been their customer for 7 years, so my list of woes is long, but I'll just sum up the current one:\n\nI canceled my account towards the middle of June. The account was to be canceled as of 7/1. \n\nOn 7/2, I moved. \n\nOn 7/8, I returned all my equipment to Charter. \n\n7/9 - present, I am STILL receiving bills for this account (now up to $280!). I have called 4 times and received INCREDIBLY poor service. People who were supposed to call me back have not. All have admitted that, yes, my account is showing up as canceled on 7/1, but that some mysterious \""work order\"" has not been completed. The current agent I am speaking with told me they actually OWE me $19, but that the account still will not be canceled until the \""work order\"" is complete. \n\nDo yourself a favor and get U-Verse or WHATEVER else is available in your area. Charter has a monopoly on downtown Madison and as such, treats its customers like crap."
0,"In my opinion, Charter Communications is just terrible.  They have been unreliable, unhelpful, rude and incapable of providing an acceptable level of service.  The customer service representatives are like talking to pre-programed robots, even in the midst of a prolonged service outage, their main goal is to sell more worthless services. Avoid this company like the plague."
0,"Do NOT. I repeat - do not do business with this company. \n\nWe purchased a furnace with an extended warranty. The warranty was for 650.00 and we were told it would cover any defects, issues etc. Within 2 years the blower motor went out on a Friday. They advised us it would be 198.00 per hour since it was overtime. This was at 3pm on a Friday. They told me to read the fine print..... you know the drill. Finally after much run around I was told we would have a man out for no charge Monday morning at 8am. Of course no one showed up. after 3 more calls and missed times finally we had a tech arrive at 12noon. They do NOT do what they say, they are rude, and not the least bit proactive. Beware of any promises the sales persons make and any comittments the company makes."
0,"Pros:\nDrinks are ok\nRib eye steak good medium rare with baked potato\nService was friendly and food served warm\nFood affordable\nrelaxing environment, local feel\n\nCons:\nScallops was to salty\nfurniture outdated\nwalleye fish was eh, not enough flavors\n\nIt's very Divey, not impressed even when my meal was free."
0,"For the price my just warm baked cod was okay but had little taste sitting in  water. Sides of hot baked potato and basic iceberg lettuce salad were fine. Waitress Amber was courteous and attentive. I enjoyed dinner until our party of 5 was asked to leave because they needed the table. Really? We were quite dismayed and told the male cashier whose response was defensive and frankly, rude. He even said if he were here co-owner Al would have asked us to leave just as the other co-owner did tonight. Wow. If true I am disappointed, Al. Your staff just lost us as customers including the other party waiting in line who walked out after us upon hearing our complaint and the cashier's response. Boo, bad customer service and not worth the food."
0,"Service was terrible! I will never return!!! We waited in the bar and were never greeted or spoken too. People walked in after us and were seated. Not sure what their structure is for seating, but they suck at it. I will not be back."
0,It you're basic bar food.  Nothing more.
0,"Do you like it when your bowels want to explode?  Then this is the place for you.  The sad thing is, the aroma coming from the restaurant is hypnotizing as it drifts through the neighborhood, and the staff is really nice, but holy jeebus, does the pizza suck.  Every time we went there we spent the rest of the night in the bathroom.  Awful."
0,"Awful, awful, awful...  The worst of the worst of the cookie-cutter Chinese restaurants.  Food without flavor, a menu without imagination and a staff of such profound indifference it's hard to tell they're even there."
0,"Tried this because it's local.  Terrible, bland Chinese food.  Not much else to say.  Will never return.  My wife wanted me to mention her sweet and sour chicken, which was battered fried chicken pieces with a side of sauce in a bowl.  When she asked where the vegetables were (like the picture), she was told there is a piece of pineapple in the sauce and that is what comes with it.  As promised, we looked hard into the sauce and found one very small piece of pineapple.  Bon Appetite."
0,"I inherited jewelry and made an appointment to come in and have it looked through to tell me what is valuable and what is not.  I came in after work and they told me what is 24k and what is not and then I had them test a few gemstones.  They told me that one of the stones was worthless--- Turned out to be a 1.7 Carat Diamond which I got appraised at two different stores to be worth approximately $21,000!!!!!\n\nThey should be embarrassed. I would not ever return to this store. I am happy they did not steal the diamond from me but had I listened to them, considered it fake and not gotten a 2nd (and 3rd) opinion, I would not have known how EXTREMELY Valuable this diamond was.\n\nShame on them!"
0,"It is not delicious, but the service is good."
0,"So I had heard from a couple of people that this was the best Chinese (American/Chinese) in town. That is not true at all! I tried a sampling appetizer, dumpling, sweet and sour chicken, among other things and there was simply no flavor nor originality. The decor of the place is nice, that must be what people are mesmerized with, so much so they forget to pay attention to the screams of agony from their tongue! I do not recommend this place.\n\nA good note is the waitress was great and the decor is fun but that's is not what I go out to eat for..."
0,"The food usually is pretty good but if you get take out, you better watch out! I used to be a nearly weekly take out customer, but over the last several months, probably 1/3 of my orders have been incorrect when ordering more the two things. Mostly it's missing pieces of the order, often a full entree is forgotten but of course these items are NEVER forgotten from your bill. \nCalling back to say the order you received is incorrect is usually not met with the apologetic, 'how can we fix this' attitude however. The staff have seemed somewhat annoyed with a simple request to refund the order left out or huffy about making the missing item for to pick up -- again. \nI always double check my take out orders now before leaving, and the staff seems annoyed I'm taking up counter space to dig through the often already leaking big. \nI received no 'thank you' on a recent pick up, despite my repeated verbal gratitude, but our most recent, and likely final, take out order was an extra large mess up. I generally order the same entree for myself (chicken fried rice, extra spicy) and used to order this nearly weekly. As I was eating my order, I though things seemed a little off, then realized instead of chicken, I was given shrimp. I'm allergic to seafood!\nWhen we called to complain, we actually had to ask for a refund. The manager was apologetic, and I understand that sometimes mistakes happen, but imperial gardens mistakes are to frequent to allow for enjoyable and confident take out."
0,"On 12/26/11 our 2008 Acura TL broke down in the Wisconsin Dells. We had just purchased it earlier that year. It was a certified used vehicle so it was still under warranty. We called Acura Roadside Assistance and they sent out a tow truck that jumped us so that we could drive to the nearest dealer to have the car looked at and fixed. The closest Acura dealer was Zimbrick of Middleton and we dealt with Shane (the manager) in the service department. They replaced the battery in our car and then informed us that our car now had a check engine light on. We asked if they could pull the codes and tell us what was wrong or even clear them and see if they came back. He told us that we would have to take the car in its current condition with the light on because he said, \""It's the day after Christmas and I just don't have the manpower to deal with it.\"". My Husband reiterated to Shane that he please just pull the codes so that we have an idea of what we were dealing with, Shane refused. We were worried about taking the car as we were traveling from Minneapolis to Chicago and it already broke down on us once. Plus, with the delay of the battery ordeal we'd be getting into Chicago during rush hour. We decided to cancel our hotel reservation that we had for that night in Chicago and called Acura of Brookfield. They said they could get us in first thing the next morning to scan it and see why there was a check engine light on. So we spent the night in Brookfield and that dealer took great care of us! They even reserved a rental car in case it was needed. I just wish that's who we would've went to first. Oh, and I forgot to mention earlier...Zimbrick of Middleton put a three inch black scuff on the drivers side rear quarter panel of our white car while it was in the shop. When we noticed it and went in to ask Shane to take a look at it he became extremely short with us and was down right rude. He implied to us that it was there from before and it clearly was not. His level of customer service was appalling."
0,My radio and navigation system went out on my Acura.   I took it in to Zimbrick who immediately determined that a small fuse had blown.  I was glad it was only a fuse until I pick up the car and was charged $100 for replacing a two dollar fuse.  I complained but got nowhere.  They have since lost several thousand dollars of my service business to other repair shops.
0,"Zimbrick Acura is dirty, just like every other Zimbrick in town.  They over-quote and refuse to even answer simple questions.  It is $125 just to walk in the door.  Acura of Brookfield starts at $74.\n\nHmm."
0,"I have had too many negative experiences with the staff in this store.  Today I tried going back after a year, and again the staff is so unhelpful, unknowledgeable and downright rude.  I called to talk with the Manager, and her attitude is just as bad.  Which I guess explains the attitudes of the staff.  There are plenty of other places to shop that actually appreciate and help customers."
0,Greenway station is a total joke.  It seems like the management can't keep businesses to stay more than six months.  They don't have really any good stores that make me stop and shop.  There really is no big draw.  The resturants are worthless.  No men's stores what so ever.  On top of all this the location is horrible.  Make this a dead mall and it will be more exciting.
0,"I have yet to walk away from this Barriques location NOT disappointed. Horrible, horrible, horrible service. Slow, unfriendly staff who refuse to even talk to you sometimes! I have the unfortunate fate of working in the same business district as this location, and it is the ONLY coffee shop within a reasonable distance. I now drive 10 minutes out of my way to work to get coffee and breakfast because I refuse to give those people any of my money. Please stay away from this location - this warning comes from a girl who has NEVER written a bad review of any place! Boo Barriques! :("
0,"Went there on Saturday night to get some food to go. On of the worst Chinese Buffets I've seen. Half of the trays were empty and other half were almost empty. Very little selection. The worst pay is the take out prices: $10.50 to get a to go box(should be under 2lb) and 40 cents for every ounce after, WTF is that!!! So we just went somewhere else that night and didn't dine there at all. Bottom line: EAT SOMEWHERE ELSE."
0,"Not sure why I keep deciding to come back here. Rice is rock hard and has no flavor, along with most of the other food on the half-empty buffet trays. $10.50 for a plate of stale food and a drink that they forget to refill? No thanks."
0,"I used to love this place - I came here once every week or two for breakfast and to sit and write for an hour or two (I'm a grad student working on my thesis). The food is expensive (~$12 for two eggs, toast, bacon, coffee) and the coffee isn't great, but the atmosphere is nice and I didn't come all that often so it seemed like sort of a luxury. The staff also isn't particularly outgoing, though not downright rude... until today. \n\nToday is Sunday, and I arrived around 8am. I usually try to get there kind of early and leave before it gets busy so I'm not taking up a table. I bought a big breakfast (as described above) and sat down to work. Just over an hour later, I was approached by a middle-aged man whom I assume is the owner or manager but whom I've never seen before. He asked if I was aware of their \""new policy\"" about Wi-Fi on Sunday mornings, and how they don't want people just hanging out using the internet when it gets crowded. (No sugar coating, that's almost verbatim what he said.) For the record, I wasn't actually using their wi-fi, I was writing. Whatever. His point was obvious. I stared at him for a few seconds because I couldn't believe that a proprietor was actually asking me, a paying customer, to leave when I had been there only an hour and in fact still had toast on my plate. He suggested it was fine for now but that when it started to get crowded I should get out. I said that if that's how they felt I would leave now, and he responded, \""That's exactly how we feel.\"" I was shocked, and still am. I have never, NEVER been treated so disrespectfully in a place of business. And I'm a regular, paying customer!! I always leave a tip! I still can't believe I was treated this way.\n\nI will no longer recommend this place, now that they've shown their true colors. If the food was exceptional I might try to swallow my pride, but it's really nothing special. There are several other breakfast/coffee shops in the area (including a Starbucks across the road) and I will be patronizing them instead from now on."
0,"Seemed like a nice place. However, after waiting in line for 20 minutes and taking quite a while to give our order (because it was VERY loud) we were told that it would take about 30 minutes to get our food. Not exactly what I wanted to hear after waiting 20 minutes but fine. When I try to pay I am informed that they do not accept debit/credit cards. Cash or check only!! No where on the door or while in line does it say cash or check only! There apparently is a very small sign on the register that says that but there is so much other crap posted in that area 99% of the people there probably never saw the sign. This is just ridiculous in this day and age to not accept cards. Even worse is the BS sign on the register. I will never eat here again just because of this!"
0,"Nice atmosphere. Like an upscale Starbucks. We ordered coffee, chai, a breakfast sandwich and quiche of the day. Was told drinks would be out in a few minutes but food would take 40 minutes. Don't know if its always like that or if they were just short staffed. But seriously 40 min for a slice of quiche and a breakfast sandwich? We told them just make the drinks, forget the food. Even so the drinks took 11 minutes. This place has potential but a wait like that is crazy. Would not recommend until they work their production issues out. One star. Disappointed."
0,Weak food for yuppies. Overpriced. Underwhelming.  And you're surrounded by West Siders who should really know better... but of course don't.
0,"ONLY TAKES CASH OR CHECK!!!\n\nSo, this is not always a deal breaker, and I have been here before and went out of my way to return. I didn't either remember this rule, or it changed since I last visited, since I usually don't carry either. They won't pay the fee for the credit card machine, but want me to dish out money for checks or ATM fees...makes me mad on principle. And there is a Starbucks literally across the street or other local joints that will gladly take my debit/credit cards down the a little ways away that I will now know to frequent instead."
0,"I'm confused why anyone would choose to go here.  \nTo be clear, my expectations were that it would be an all Asian version of Noodles & Co.  Cheap, decent, fresh food.  \nCheap - yep\nDecent - no\nFresh - maybe at one point\nI ordered the Thai curry noodles.  Not impressed.  I've never tasted something that claimed to be curry with so little flavor.  My vegetables were obviously charred and they still sent me the dish.  Yuck.  My boyfriend ordered the teriyaki udon, and the noodles were too skinny to be udon with the same flavor issues.  Not even the chili garlic sauce did much to it.  \nChin's - good concept, but a waste of money even at $6."
0,"For what it is, a fast food Americanized Oriental restaurant, it's not overly bad, as long as you don't order shrimp.\n\nService: I've never had a problem here. While not always the most outgoing service, they are friendly. My order is always ready in a decent amount of time. I've never dined in, so I won't comment on atmosphere.\n\nTheir menu and nutritional info is easily accessed on line. \n\nFor the most part, I've had OK experiences with the food selections. I don't expect spectacular food from this place, it is, after all, 'Fast Food' from a restaurant chain. It's nothing really special. \n\nHowever, today I had an experience that sort of turned my stomach a bit. I ordered a Shrimp and Veggie Stir fry to go. When I got back to work and went to dig in, I was a little disgusted to find that the shrimp were not deveined prior to cooking. For those of you who don't know what that means: The Shrimp's digestive track (seen as a dark brown 'vein' along the spine of the shrimp) wasn't removed, which means that the digestive track and it's contents were left in place. Yes, I know it's not horrible to eat it, but if you know what it is, it can turn your stomach. I assumed that a restaurant such as this would devein shrimp prior to cooking. \n\nI pulled all the shrimp and deveined them myself, but I'd already lost my appetite. I did put the shrimp aside and ate some of the brown rice and veggies, but with my stomach already feeling a bit nauseous, that didn't go well. So now I'm left with an $8 meal sitting on my desk (soon to hit the garbage) with only about 1/8th of it consumed and having to find an alternative for lunch. \n\nLesson learned, if I'm craving a good stir fry with shrimp, shell out the extra cash for PF Changs.\n\n**** I thought eventually I'd go back, but I haven't been since then. We had some of their food catered in for work, it was overcooked, rubbery, and chewy. yeah, next time I'll get my own lunch."
0,"Only thing less disappointing then the food is the staff.   Ordered Chin Wings, Hot & Sour soup and Sesame Chicken to go.. What I get in return is Chin Wings with the wrong stir fry sauce, a cup of hot & sour and lemon chicken.  They charged me for what I ordered, yet they still refused a refund me or to replace my food.. Avoid this place like the plague."
0,"The food was decent.  But yet again, the staff managed to screw my order up and ended up charging me more then what I should of payed for."
0,"This is poor quality ingredients in a fast food, order at counter from the wall and they'll give you a number and bring it to you. Staff was sullen. Noodles were greasy and flavorless as were the spring rolls. Won't go back. I will say that the place looked clean."
0,Went to Denny's this morning for breakfast with my twins and fiance. We walked in the door and their was no hostess which is understandable if they are busy but they really weren't. We had at least five servers look dead at us as well as cooks and stood there for a good five minutes and still no one said anything to us so we walked out and went to the McDonald's across the street.
0,"I don't recommend going there.  My wife and I decided to go there for some dessert after a very nice dinner.  I wanted an \""Apple Pie A la Cold Stone\"".  I have had this before and it is normally very good.  I was told that they had been out of the pie filling for a while.  Yet this is one of their \""Signature Creations\"".  I would expect that if this is something that they always have that they would have on their menu, they would have the ingredients for it.  Then, My wife ordered their seasonal \""Funnel Cake Sundae.  My wife ended up waiting 15 minutes for this.  Jacob and Chad told us that they had to reheat the Funnel cake for the sundae twice.  This made is rock hard and she had to throw most of the funnel cake away because she could not eat it.  As we were waiting, I noticed how dirty the entire interior was.  It looks like the floors and base boards have not cleaning in months.  Tables and floors were dirty and sticky-GROSS.  I did not check the bathrooms, too scared to try.  On top of all this, the price for their \""Creations\"" is way too high!!!  I am tempted to call the health department for an inspection.  DON\""T GO THERE!!!  it is a waste of time and money."
0,"First off,I feel I am friendly and easy to get along with, but this was the worst \""bartending experience\"" I have ever encountered! [It was Thanksgiving Eve 6:15 in case the owner/manager might read this]. Either I was 1] not a regular or 2]a bother. NEVER again!"
0,"I ate here on Dec 1st (big mac combo) and it did not feel well after words. I learned that they and all Mc D's use ammoniated beef, it is frank'in food. Madison is full of privately owned restaurants that serve real food, not chemical and byproducts dressed up as food. Save your kids, save your self. Just say no to the evil fake food"
0,"Was here for a gala at the adjoining conference center.  Service was terrible. The waitress kept slamming food and drinks on the  table. She only brought dinner for half the table and the rest had to wait for 15 minutes. One of the guests had to wait about 20 minutes for the meal. Horrible!\nI've been to many Marriotts before and hold a frequent visitor card, but this one has been the worst experience so far.\n\nI know this isn't a review that completely reflects the hotel or any restaurants inside it, but the fact that this service was under the Marriott name prompted this review and rating"
0,"Bedding was stained on pillow and comforter.  Asked front desk to have this changed upon leaving for dinner.  After arriving back at the hotel, bedding had not been changed.  Called front desk and was told that housekeeping was gone for the night.  At check-out I mentioned the issue and was simply verbally told \""Sorry.\""\n\nNot acceptable.  My 2nd Mariott stay this year, and I am not giving up my Priority Club Platinum membership to ever try Mariotts again."
0,"The room was fine, obviously outdated but it looks as though they are upgrading currently. The food on the other hand was overpriced and gross. Do yourself a favor and do not order room service. It looked as though it was prepared at a truck stop, nuked and then brought up to my room. I complained, they said sorry and that was it. No new food, no help from the front desk and still charged me for it. Platinum member service my butt."
0,"It's loud, the employees are not friendly, and you simply can't trust them for a wake up call... I didn't even get an \""I'm Sorry\"" when they entered a 6am wake up call for 7am!\n\nAnd I've been Marriott Platinum for 10 years! If they can't be courteous to their elite guests, how are they to everyone else? Skip this hotel..."
0,Worst marriott experience in twenty years of traveling. The hotel manager is a joke and very rude. I complained about the service at the hotel and asked for the phone number to complain. He responded by threatening to call the police. Just crazy to think this hotel would rather call the police on a Gold member than give the number to customer service.
0,"This is in regards to their Events Department - \n\nI had my wedding reception here last year. I complained about the management and received little compensation for all that had gone wrong. \n\nIn the 6 months it took to begin planning my wedding reception to briefly following the reception I had 3 different events coordinators. The first two were amazing, but they left for good reason, the hotel events department was barely a-float. \n\nThere's literally a list of things that went wrong, but the two most concerning: \n1) The hired serving staff (many from temp agencies) didn't do their jobs! \n2) One of the hired staff were high/drunk, and when he and others were asked for help by my family were giving them sass and they still didn't help. \n\nDuring the wedding, all I saw was how things were going wrong. So unfortunately, I didn't enjoy majority of my reception. When you spend all that time planning and spending $$$ and things are being executed half ass or not at all.. it's pretty distressful for an already stressed bride. I complained about this, but it wasn't until I got in touch with Marriott International that anyone called me back. They admitted they were going through many staff changes and apologized for the various incidents. \n\nWhen you spend about $14,000 for SOLELY service and drinks (we catered food). I expect top notch service. My overall bill still had the 22% service gratuity (which they deserved NONE of - which I argued). In the end they reimbursed me $990 which was half the service gratuity. I hate to be ungrateful but that's ridiculous. \n\n\nMy only reason to write this review is because I wish I had known that their events services had gone downhill in past few years. I held an event there in 2010 and the events coordinator at the time, Diana??, and the service were great. People plannng events here should ask the following questions: \n1) Are they still using temps and what experience/requirements do they have?\n2) If things don't go right (which they have someone from the staff on floor during your events - so they can see it themselves), how can they offer compensation or fix the situation??\n\nAt the end - the temps were what were blamed for all the awful service (not clearing plates - my family cleared plates, serving drinks in CANS - when i made it a point everything should be served in glassware, etc...) So that's who I would ask the most questions about. \n\nI hope that things change for the Marriott in the future. They used to be one of the best places to hold large scale events in Madison. In the end, I do wish them the best in getting back to where they once used to be."
0,"First night not so great. Immediately apparently means 30 minutes later AFTER you call again to the front desk. No one in the room next to me, alarm clock goes off. After waiting 10 minutes, and then knocking on door with no response, call front desk and am told it will be taken care of immediately. Waited 30 minutes, and called back. Then someone came up to take of it.\nIt been a bad day, and this is an excellent end to it.\n3 more nights to go, woo hop!\nAmbiance C\nCleanliness C (generally grungy everywhere)\nCustomer Service D\n(Only selected 1 star because I couldn't post with none)"
0,"This one is a big fail. After having been told numerous times that I had to go to Clasen's Bakery, I finally went. What I found was a large room filled with unappetizing, boring baked goods. Nothing in here did I want, or have any desire to try. There were loaves of bread, but the selection is better at Whole Foods or Willy Street Co-op. The cookies had the panache and flair of the garbage that is sold in Starbucks. Chocolate chip, peanut butter, sugar? What is so European about any of this? Greenjim H said about high prices? I am not sure what he bought, I saw nothing that would be classified as high priced. The pastries were as boring as the cookies, danish, morning bun?\n\nI don't know how this classifies as a European bakery. This is an average bakery, in a very far out of the way place. I am sure there are better places to go to grab a loaf of bread and a cookie."
0,"I ordered a birthday cake for the first time through Clasen's. Due to the flu going through our house, I had to reschedule the party and the cake for the following week. the Baker did not get my cancellation and baked the cake. Clasen's said they were sorry and not to worry about it. When I picked up the cake the following week it was stale. my guess is they just kept the cake in the fridge until I picked it up the following Friday. I called to let them know they apologized and said they would call me back. I never heard from them. :( Disappointing."
0,"The staff is very rude. As soon as I find another place to fix my watches, I will go there. VERY disappointed."
0,"I order it for my employees occasionally.  The pizza is what you expect, nothing better than OK.  They throw on an extra $1.50 for delivery charge and the drivers tell us that most goes directly to the managers pockets.  That Sucks."
0,"Gross! I generally love Papa Johns, but this one is lacking in all areas. I ordered PJs for lunch and once it finally arrived (1 hour later), it was luke warm and soggy. Apart from that, the staff lacks any work ethic or customer service. The three people I dealt with were all rude and careless. Initially, they ended up giving me a $5 credit. Ha! As if I would order again anyway."
0,"I was so disappointed after reading all of the reviews.  Firstly, breakfast stops at 11:00 on weekdays and noon on the weekends, NOTE THAT because when we showed up today after my husbands late night shift the night before they would not serve us breakfast.\n\nCASH OR CHECK ONLY\n\nWorth noting, both menus are pretty slim, but breakfast is larger than lunch.  \n\nThey were out of the fried chicken \""dinner\"" (you mean lunch, since they were only open till 2, right?). We ended up ordering the patty melt, ok, fish sandwich, subpar, and onion rings, good but not $3 good. Sandwiches come with chips, not fries.  But was definitely not the pancakes that everyone else was raving about that I was craving.  The coffee was sting but a bit bitter. The total was just under $20 without tip. \n\nThe decor is old, doesn't bother me too much, but looking at the filthy carpets, it was disgusting and I was a bit afraid since I was wearing flat sandals.  Before I forget to mention it, the place smells like smoke when you first walk in, I was completely expecting to see ashtrays at the booths.\n\nThe service was excellent... If you are a regular. If not, plan on spending about three times too much there. We waited for about 5 minutes for our waitress ( one of the owners) to shout sit where you want.  We grabbed a table. My husband had to take a work call, but had given me his order. After waiting 10 minutes, I had to flag our waitress down to place our orders, and she looked at me shocked that I would want something to eat. Trying to get the check out of her was terrible. By 12:15 the lunch regulars had started coming in, so she was chatting about a recent wedding, showings hem the wedding pictures, talking about what the place looked like, etc. by 12:30 I had out cash on the end of the table hoping to move things along.  She walked past us three times without making eye contact, finally, I put my arm out and asked for the check, which had not been prepared, wait for another 5 minutes while she served more regulars and FINALLY she got back to using we were out of there by 12:50. \n\nIn short, we will never return.  It is expensive for what you get, food is unremarkable, serve is terrible, and it seemed like it could use a food service inspection because it was pretty dirty."
0,I called in and made an appointment for 1:30 giving me plenty of time to get my haircut and make my massage appointment 1/4 mile down the street.  I show up at 1:25 and someone is in George's chair just starting to get their hair cut.  When I walk in nobody says anything to me so I sit down and wait.  At 1:45 (15 min past my appointment time and still no one has said a word to me) the guy is still getting his hair cut and he is not even close to being done.  So I tell George I can't wait any longer because I will miss my other appointment.  He tells me we still got time to hang out a little longer.  At 1:50 he finally decides he doesn't have enough time to cut my hair.  You are supposed to be hair cutting professionals.  You should know how long it is going to take to cut someone's hair.  If the person before me showed up late for their appointment why should mine be pushed back? or When I walked in why not tell me hey we are running 30 minutes behind can you wait?  Instead you say nothing absolutely no common courtesy nor do you care that you wasted an hour out of my work day with this.  Someone at Dick and Arnies explain this to me WHAT IS THE POINT OF MAKING AN APPOINTMENT IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO STICK TO THE TIME SCHEDULE?  I AM A BUSY PERSON AND DO NOT HAVE TIME TO SIT AROUND ALL AFTERNOON FOR A HAIRCUT!   Needless to say I am in the market for a new barber.
0,"The worst. They tried to have my car towed for parking in their \""delivery spot\"" that was marked with a sign so small you'd need binoculars to see it. Not cool."
0,"This is by far the worst UPS store I have dealt with. A package was not delivered to my work because it didn't have a suite number on the address, a suite number is not necessary because we have a front desk that handles deliveries. Then they mailed me a letter stating that I had to go to Middleton to pick it up or they would send it back to the store. I live no where near Middleton and refuse to pick it up. So hope and pray that you do not have to deal with this store."
0,"One of our first restaurant visits when we moved here.  We have since learned to avoid any restaurant a local recommends.  Menu was full of bland comfort food.  Wife had chicken and dumplings that tasted like they came out of a can  My steak was tough and flavorless.  Restaurant has been in the same location for about 100 years and it shows, it's badly in need of a remodel.  Entire place smelled like vomit and was dirty.  I could smell the bathrooms ten feet away and when I had to visit they were even worse, layer over layer of dirt.  Where's the health inspector.  Service was extremely poor, especially considering we were the only people in the place.  I guess the highschooler that was serving us was too busy talking on her cell phone to help us."
0,"I went to have their buffet with my family on a Saturday. The selection looked appetizing, but tasted HORRIBLE. A salt lick was disguised as dinner (fortunately, I probably will not need embalming fluid once I pass -- considering the incidental preservation). Since i picked it out, I was trying to trick my wife into thinking I liked it, but I could not make it through a 2nd plate. \n\nThe waitress was poor. Her shrill manner and punch-drunk words almost equaled the disgusting taste of the food. \n\nSadly, EVEN Old Country Buffet's service and food far exceed that of this sh*thole at a 1/3 of the cost."
0,"Yeah, I have to agree with the other reviews. Had the fish fry last week. Really tasteless and not good. Some pieces were way over cooked. Salad bar was ok, but all the prices are high for what you get. Bar area was nice and bartenders nice and quick to get drinks. I think this place must be better for steaks or breakfast - skip the fish."
0,"Wish I would have consulted Yelp before dining here... \n\nI'm new to the area, and drive past this place quite often, and thought I'd give their Sunday brunch a try. Big mistake. The food was awful. With the exception of the salad bar and fresh fruit, everything tasted and looked like it had been previously frozen or canned. \n\nSimply put - I've had continental breakfasts at the Holiday Inn that were better.\n\nOur waiter was a nice guy. Very pleasant. Too bad the food wasn't."
0,Tried to purchase some DJ equipment from this company. My order was denied because my billing address for my credit card was different from my shipping address. Really?! I run several companies and have never run into to this. One of my companies the billing address is our PO Box and the mailing address is the store front or what if I wanted to send a gift to someone? I obviously can't do it through Full Compass.  Also why do you offer the option of a alternate billing or mailing address? Doesn't make sense especially in this economy. I'll be sure to send along my $600+ receipt from the company that's okay with a different mailing address.
0,"After the hype about their burgers I was really looking forward to trying the food here. \n\nThe meh: The hushpuppies were 1/2 way decent, but nothing extraordinary. Edible. No honey offered with them though.\n\nThe ugh: With the all of the acclaim their burgers get, you would think that they were doing something special here. They aren't. The burgers are frozen patties and look like they're right from Sysco. The reason that people are probably saying they're so good is because the patties aren't cooked within an inch of a briquette. Normally I would say that's a good thing, but when you're making me a burger from an unknown origin handled by who knows how many people....needless to say, medium rare frozen beef patty is doesn't = amazing burger in my book. \n\nI can't say that I would visit again. There are far too many amazing hamburgers on the west side made with real beef from local butchers to waste my time with this place.\n\nUPDATE: I've spoken with a couple of people that are thinking it may be a fluke that I ended up with frozen patties the time I was there. Apparently they have a machine there that they make their patties with. I'm going to have to revisit in the near future to investigate."
0,"Walgreens has become a travesty of retail. During my most recent visit for a pack of gum and a bottle of water, I waited in line for nearly 10-minutes and watched two cashiers swap registers no fewer than 4 times, and I have no idea why. \n\nThe gentleman with his wife in front of me said, \""This is the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen at a store, ever.\"" And I couldn't have agreed more.\n\nWhen it came time for me to check-out, my total came to $3.16, and I was asked if I was a member of their rewards club, followed by \""why not\"" followed by, \""why not join? it's free!\"" \n\nWhen I declined, and opted to pay in cash, the guy took my $4 and then didn't give me any change. He wished me \""well\"" and when I asked for my change, he looked at me like I was crazy... I reminded him that I paid $4 for a $3.16 item. He then said, \""Oh, did you want your change?\""\n\nUgh."
0,"My Experiences in this store have not been good for some years now.  GAP, Banana, and Old Navy used to make affordable and quality clothing, but in the past few years, the prices have increased and the quality has gone to shit.  Clothes I have bought have had their hems fall out after one wearing and their buttons fall off quite easily.  Not only is the quality bad, but the service is horrendous.  Last time I was in the store, a worker said hi to me, but after looking around for a while, never checked in with me, and when I needed a fitting room they were locked and I had to wait almost 10 minutes to get the gals attention to let me in.  \nThe last pair of shoes I bought there were quite comfortable, but within the first 30 minutes of wear, the heel feel off completely.  If you are looking for work attire/dress clothes, I would recommend passing on Banana Republic and trying your luck at Macy's or another retailer."
0,"Disgusting. \nThat's the only word that comes to mind after walking front of store to back and seeing piles upon piles of clothing and items askew on every table, shelf and rack. I'd understand if it was 7pm on a Saturday (weekend) but this was Monday morning y'all, and the place looked like the pits! What the heck BR? You are a mess! An absolute mess. And you're consistently a mess. \nI walked in today with the intent to buy a suit (40% your entire purchase... sign up for their emails) but I couldn't even shop the racks with crammed half on hangers, half off hangars pants and jackets. This place needs an iron fist. A store manager who can shape this thing up and restore BRs name as a Gap Inc brand. Someone would have to tell me they did a complete 180 for me to return."
0,"Nuh uh. Nope. No no no. My daughter wanted to eat here for her birthday this year, having eaten at the one downtown successfully 4 years ago. Her birthday, her pick. Plus, she delights in the free mug of soda and balloon. She's a birthday sell-out and I think that must be how they suck you in. \nBut, I digress. Our order took an aggravatingly long time to arrive and our glasses remained empty after having drunk their contents while waiting. There was a Packers game on and many of the wait staff were watching that. I don't know if that was the hold up, but it was a bit irritating. \nWhen our meals finally arrived, my children discovered that the insides of their burgers were very pink. Waaaaay too pink for medium well, which they ordered. It was scary pink and super soft--like raw hamburger generally is. When I told our waiter about it, he was completely uninterested in helping fix the situation, and instead, argued with me about it for quite a while, finally saying, \""That's what medium well looks like\"" in a tone that suggested that I was simply too stupid to know the difference. I'm not. Finally I convinced him to humor me and take them back to be cooked through. He did so with a smidgen of contempt.\nAs a side-note, my husband's burger was to be well done and was also pink, though not raw.\nStill no drink refills.\nNo one offered a discount, a refund, a free soda while we waited, and especially not an apology. Obviously we won't be back."
0,The Nitty in Middleton seems to live off of its name recognition. The food is so-so at best. I had the premium Prarie Farms burger. To bad it was completely unseasoned. Toasting the bun on a $10 burger would've been a nice touch and would have added som texture. Why bother to pay for a premium products if they aren't properly prepared. I also think the menu is in the pricey side for basic so-so bar food. The choice of sides did yield a nice surprise - fresh asparagus spears.  \n\nThis meal was a disappointment. There are few places that can pull off a decent burger. You want a great pub burger... Hit the Eastside - go to Players.
0,"I bought four woven shades at Home Depot on October 23, 2013 that Springs Window Fashions manufactured. After installation it is obvious that they do not line up horizontally. I have contacted customer service four times and \""Pedro\"" has still not responded. Today is January 7, 2014."
0,"There are hardly words to describe how poorly made their products are, but they've managed to dig a little bit deeper with their customer service. We purchased a home that had what we thought were Hunter-Douglas window coverings, but turned out to be Springs. The plastic clips had cracked and broken in direct sun (funny, but you put window coverings up to keep out the sun). Our licensed installer called them to get replacements, they sent the wrong thing. Then it turned out the battery packs weren't working. They wouldn't send them, telling him I (the customer) had to call. When I finally got through (no mean feat) they told me they don't sell directly to customers. ? After expressing my extreme displeasure he agreed to send me the battery packs. He told me 5 days. They didn't run the credit card until  a week later, Then it turns out a motor is bad. As the blinds are \""just\"" 5 years old, they don't warranty them. My guy talked to them two weeks ago and we were told a \""motor resetting tool\"" (really?) would be here by Tuesday. It's been two weeks. No reset tool.  I know the original owners went for Springs to save a few dollars, but this is where the cheap turns out expensive. And time consuming. AVOID. AT. ALL. COSTS. (costs being a key word here)"
0,The manual car wash is very expensive. I am going to do my car at home from now on. The price of the manual to do a good job approaches a full service wash with interior clean up.
0,"1. They moved, and their website still shows the old address.  The new location is \""hidden\"" behind a larger building, and to get into the salon, you have to enter in through an \""outer\"" building; it's a suite inside of a building. Didn't matter much since they were closed by the time I found the place.\n\n2. They were closed by 4:50pm, and they don't have their hours posted anywhere at their new location. I'd refer to their website for info, but it's apparently out of date.\n\nI love Aveda products; I will apparently have to go elsewhere to buy them."
0,"I had an unbelievable experience yesterday. I went to Vin Santo hoping to order some food to go. Upon brief greeting the owner informed us that they \""don't do takeout on the weekend\"". This is astonishing and something that has never happened to me before.  I am a foodie an have dined on 5 different continents, including Michelin rated restaurants. Shocked, we went to Villa Dolce where the owner was very accommodating to our take out request. The food was delicious and very reasonably priced. Your loss Vin Santo. We are never coming back."
0,"Unbelievably disappointed.  I'm in town for business, and went on a week night.  They were not terribly busy, but as a solo diner, I was treated quite poorly.  Mostly ignored during my meal, I had to get up to chase someone down just for a water refill.  Not once did anyone check on my meal (I would have loved a second glass of wine), which wasn't stellar anyway.  \nI did stop and tell the woman at the front that not every diner has the luxury of being able to eat with family or friends, and that I felt my service was horrible.  Maybe it'll spare the next person eating alone and hoping for good service.\nI travel to Madison Wi frequently for work, and I can tell you that they'll not get repeat business from me."
0,Horrendously managed. Terrible service. Very rude and the managers seem to treat their employees with no respect. The drinks a watery and the tap selection is average. Food is ok but not worth a trip over to this joint. I don't recommend.
0,"A friend proposed Club Tavern for fish fry.  None of us had ever been there.\nWhile the food overall wasnt the WORST I've had, I wouldnt recommend eating there unless someone buys your meal for you, or youve been stranded on a desert island for 5 years and this is the first \""real\"" meal you've had in ages.  To some, it may make you want to go back to the island...atleast food is fresh.\n\nWe arrived 10 mins after the 4 other people of our party, after 20 more minutes the waiter came back to see what we wanted to drink.  Forgot to note, for a Friday night at 7:30 the place was pretty much empty in the dining area.\n\nI ordered a diet pepsi and the others ordered random alcoholic drinks.  My soda was flat, watery and had some kind of scum on top of it.  I thought I may be crazy, so everyone at the table tried the soda and agreed it was disgusting.  Waiter came back and I asked for a diet dew instead.  Received a diet dew that tasted a little less flat.....but now the glass had a leak in it while went everywhere.  Asked for a glass from the bar w diet pepsi.  It seemed a little less flat, but not by much.  Atleast that glass was clean.\nFriend ordered the hog heaven, bloody mary with bacon infused vodka.  He said it wasnt the worst drink, but mainly tasted like greasy bacon fat, not a smokey bacon flavor.  Didnt try it myself.\n\nAfter the soda ordeal, it had been 20 mins since we arrived I ordered some Moo-skis as an appetizer, which are listed as hashbrowns covered in bacon, onion, and cheese from what i remember.\n20 mins after that waiter came back to take our order.  I gave him my order of all you can eat fish and asked about the appetizer.  He said \""oh ya, forgot about those, theyll be right up.\""\n5 or 6 minutes later, he came back to check our drink status, and said \""Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand.....you had moo-skis.....theyll be here soon.\""\n5 or 6 mins later again he brought out the moo-skis.\n\nThey were hashbrowns on a small side plate with a small layer of shredded mozza on top.  Very plain and greasy tasting.  Realized there should be bacon and onion...which i found tiiiiny few far between pieces inside hash later.  For the 3 or 4 dollars, would have been better used for just plain hashbrowns at a diner for a dollar.\n\nFinally get the all you can eat fish which had 2 pieces of pollock, beer battered fries, tartar, and coleslaw:\nFish: ok sized. breading was hard(which i like), taste ok. Not worst Ive had, but no where near good.\nFries: Were best part of the meal.\nTartar: Different, paprika or something in it for a red color.  didnt taste any dill.\nColeslaw:  Im not sure you could even call this slaw.  It was literally a small cup of mayo, with maybe 2 tiny forks of cabbage.  Im not exaggerating that it was a little liquidy...it was literally SOUP.\n\nOrdered a 2nd piece of fish which I got 5 mins later w more tartar.\n\nWe were still eating and I ordered a 3rd piece of fish.\nHe came back with our checks after 10 mins.  We laughed that the forgetting of the fish was on par w our night.  2 friends paid seperate and we had 2 parties of 2.  Super simple orders, but he ended up bringing the bills up wrong 3 times so we had to continue to correct.  Had to take our payments one at a time which added another 10 mins.\n\nFinishing up our bills........and kitchen staff brings me the last piece of fish about 30 mins after ordering it and when we were getting up.\n\nMaybe it was a one time bad experience, but considering how dead it was on a friday night....Im guessing our experience is pretty representative of the food/wait staff which is a shame since the place really has a nice flair or feel inside it.\n\nThe best part of the experience was the upbeat classic 80s music.\n\nWe  all received buy one get one coupons upon leaving.  Not sure if it was just us or everyone gets them.\n\n30 mins after getting home, I spent lots of time in the bathroom as it all came rushing out the bottom pipes.  I have an iron stomach and don't get messed up by much.\n\ngirlfriend edit:  Reminded me she didnt get the salad she ordered and had to ask.  Also noted her old fashioned came w cherries and olives in it, which is taboo? Supposed to be one or other?  Im a crazy WI who doesnt order many OF's, so not sure about this."
0,Crappy customer service.  I was the only minority in the store the whole time (wearing Ann Taylor clothes I had previously purchased at other stores) and these biotches followed me around like I was going to steal something.
0,Worst service ever.
0,Terrible customer service. Was denied the option to return items out of return window that was easily taken back and reimbursed at an alternate location. Was not allowed to talk to a manager when requested.  Disappointed this represents the LOFTs brand.
0,"First, the good stuff: the staff are really nice.\n\nThat being said, the units are ghetto. Burglars smash and grab in broad daylight. Domestically violent neighbors require police assistance in the night hours. The door locks are a joke. Snow removal seems to be done on an \""at will\"" basis. Units haven't been renovated in decades, aside from the incidental balcony that needs to be brought up to code -- seriously, is this carpet original? The water literally takes 5min to rise in temp from frigid to lukewarm, and another 5min to rise to shower temp. All the sockets are so old and worn-out that plugs fall out under their own weight -- WTF?\n\nIt could be worse I guess. I could live next to a crack house."
0,"They no longer have a flower shop.  I went in looking for a BIG \""vase\"" to hold a big bunch of flowers.  After poking around for a couple minutes I asked an employee for such.  He walked me over to another woman who repeated my request a couple times (a vase?  a VASE?).  Ok, wft woman, I have a bunch of flowers for my dad's memorial service, I've got 10 minutes to find something to put them in before I shove them up your a$$.  Yes, I was a little stressed.  She went in to this long thing about how they didn't have a flower shop any more and they might have a few in the back but they weren't priced to sell.  I interrupted her and said, \""So the answer is no?\""  I asked twice.  She wouldn't give me an answer.  I started walking out.  There were a bunch of, forgive me, \""Hurricane glasses\"" which would suit my needs just marvy.  I picked one up and started looking around for something better.  Bitch woman saw me and said, \""Oh, well, we DO have CANDLEHOLDERS\"".  Didn't offer to help me anymore.  I made a point of picking up just about every single one I could find.  Apparently, \""vase\"" is a technical term reserved for something very special.\nAnyway, I bought something and ended up returning it the next day because the same thing at Cost Plus was $9 rather than $27.\nPoor service, high prices, crappy selection.  Fail."
0,"I ordered three trees to planted by the Bruce company early summer.  I was told they wouldn't be able to get to it until early September.  What?, well, ok I'll wait because they have nice nursery stock.   I called mid September when they still hadn't planted the trees and I was given a date of Sept. 25.  Not to my surprise, no one showed.  I called and they said everything was delayed due to the rain.  It hadn't rained for weeks, but they would be there next Tuesday.  Tuesday has come and gone and no trees.  I called and cancelled my tree order and asked for my 50% , $500 deposit back.  It is now too late for trees to be planted and established by winter.  I am waiting to hear back from them.  I will give an update later on as to whether I get my deposit back!  I have had trouble in the past with them not showing up for a job..no call ..nothing.  I should have learned my lesson then!"
0,"1)  The customer service at this store is terrible.  The employees are rude, particularly Scott who works in the plant section.   \n2)  The plants this past summer were infested.  I had to return two mandevillas because of aphids, and Bruce gave me a hard time about refunding me.  Last straw:  the $50 rubber plant I purchased in August came home with some time of mite infestation, I was able to treat the plant successfully, but recently noticed that the plant was ailing.  Upon close inspection, I noticed it was full of aphids.  Disgusting.  I am fortunate that my other plants, which came from different nurseries, were not infected.  Rubber plant went in garbage, and I will never waste another dollar at Bruce Company again."
0,"Our tour guide was the worst tour guide I've ever had. I've been on many brewery tours and grains do not get their flavor from being in honey or dipped in chocolate. Many of us realized she was completely clueless. The number of uhs, ums, and ahs overwhelmed me. At least 21 in one room of the tour. I had to stop counting for my own sanity. By the end, most people had stopped listening or began to have their own conversation. It's unfortunate for a place to lose customers due to their tour especially when they have good beer. I'd love my money back but I doubt I'd get it."
0,"I spent the better part of seven years of my life as an automotive technician at a fairly large (20+ techs) dealership, and as such fully and completely appreciate the expertise, knowledge, and service that a dealership provides.\n\nWhenever possible, I purchase parts and services from local dealerships.  Yes, I could save a ton of money on parts by buying items online, but as mentioned, I respect dealerships and understand the benefits of supporting local businesses.  \n\nThat said, this particular VW dealership (the Zimbrick on Century Avenue is only a VW dealer, BTW - no Acura any longer at this location) shocked me with their inability to comprehend a simple request for oil, an oil filter, and a fuel filter.\n\nI called to check the price and availability for some common, everyday maintenance items for my VW Jetta.  My Jetta has the 1.9L BRM Diesel motor (\""PD\"" style), and as such has some unique requirements as identified by Volkswagen, specifically when it comes to oil.  VW mandates that you use their 505.01 approved oil in the BRM diesel motor.  Failure to do so may result in a voided or compromised warranty.\n\nSo imagine my shock when the parts guy told me to use \""any old oil\"" while on the phone.  When I tried to correct him and request the 505.01 Castrol VW oil, he seemed to get a bit unnerved.\n\nI then asked about a fuel filter, and despite having told him the make, model, year, and engine type of my VW on three separate occasions, he still misquoted my filter.  I then gave him my VIN, and he was still confused.  A few minutes later, he quoted me the correct filter, but at a price that was easily 2x higher than what I would pay from any other online VW parts dealer.\n\nSo, I declined to purchase anything from this local resource, and will now have to shop online with an out-of-the-area dealership.  I'm sorry, but my confidence was shaken immediately, and I was floored by the sky high price (they quoted $60 for the filter; everyone else is $25)."
0,It's called fast food. Not wait for three hours for a fricking burger food. WTF  how hard is it honestly?
0,"I have given this burger king a chance MANY times... But they are BY FAR the slowest burger king I have EVER been to... Even if they have no customers inside, and you go through the empty drive through, they will STILL make you pull forward and wait for your meal, one time it was over a half hour! Absolutely unreasonable."
0,"I would give this BK a -1 star if I could. They just recently renovated their building, cool, looks nice. I've stopped going to this location, it is the worst in fast food. Once i was told in the drive-thru that they were out of meat, but had chicken or fish. LOL Seriously! The king of burgers out of meat!?!?!? The wait in the drive-thru is painfully SLOW! I once ordered, waited for like 10-15 minutes, got fed up and left. Drove over to Wendy's, got my food and drove past BK on the way home. The truck i was behind in the drive-thru was still in the same spot! Crazy. \n\nThis BK NEEDS better management and training for the employees. They just don't seem to care. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"
0,"Having won a free small frapee from the \""Family Food\"" giveaway at another Burger King, I decided to go inside the Sun Prairie location to cash it in. This was after I waited for almost twenty minutes at the drive-through, even after the order taker told me she'd be with me in, \""just a second.\"" Inside the lobby, I was met by a scene of dirty tables, slow service, and a floor littered with a surprising ammount of plastic gloves. When I finally made it to the counter, I was amazed to learn that it is somehow possible to take my order without saying a single word to me, and then simply walking away without even handing me a reciept. Perhaps it was this same top-notch service and accuracy that caused another customer there to have to come back not once, not twice, but THREE times because they made his food wrong. At this point, my instincts said to leave, but my honor required that I stick with it to the bitter end. But when I finally got the free frapee, I was saddened to say that it was not worth the wait. If you value your ability to eat at Burger King more than your time, I would suggest staying in your car at this location and living in blissful ignorance. As for me, it'll be a while before I have it my way again."
1,"dr. goldberg offers everything i look for in a general practitioner.  he's nice and easy to talk to without being patronizing; he's always on time in seeing his patients; he's affiliated with a top-notch hospital (nyu) which my parents have explained to me is very important in case something happens and you need surgery; and you can get referrals to see specialists without having to see him first.  really, what more do you need?  i'm sitting here trying to think of any complaints i have about him, but i'm really drawing a blank."
1,Top notch doctor in a top notch practice. Can't say I am surprised when I was referred to him by another doctor who I think is wonderful and because he went to one of the best medical schools in the country. \nIt is really easy to get an appointment. There is minimal wait to be seen and his bedside manner is great.
1,"Dr. Eric Goldberg is a fantastic doctor who has correctly diagnosed every issue that my wife and I have had. Unlike many of my past doctors, Dr. Goldberg is very accessible and we have been able to schedule appointments with him and his staff very quickly. We are happy to have him in the neighborhood and look forward to being his patients for many years to come."
1,"This place was DELICIOUS!!  My parents saw a recommendation to visit this place from Rick Sebak's \""25 Things I Like About Pittsburgh\"" and he's usually pretty accurate.  His recommendations were to try the Reuben, Fish Sandwich and Open-Faced Steak Sandwich.  We went early afternoon for a late lunch today (a Saturday) and were seated right away.  The staff is extremely friendly.  My Mom & I each had the fish sandwich, while my Dad & Brother had a Reuben sandwich.  The fish was very good, but the Reuben was to die for!  Both dishes were massive, and could very easily be shared between two people.  On top of being extremely large portions, it was incredibly affordable.  The giant fish sandwich was $8 and the giant Reuben was $7.50.  Our drinks were always filled and we were checked on several times during the meal.  We will definitely be back!!!  Oh and a bit of advice ahead of time - they take CASH ONLY.  So come prepared, but I'm pretty sure I saw an ATM there as well.  And I do believe they are closed on Sundays & Mondays."
1,Can't miss stop for the best Fish Sandwich in Pittsburgh.
1,"This place should have a lot more reviews - but I'm glad it doesn't, they don't need to get any busier.\n\nIts been there ages, and looks it. If you're all about ambiance, don't bother. If you pretend you're in a movie set in Pittsburgh 30 years ago it works pretty well. The service is sometimes hit or miss. Most of girls are good, one is very slow, one is amazing. They are all friendly and usually a few different people will check in to make sure that you're happy. Everything is made fresh so be prepared that nothing comes flying out of that kitchen - busy times it can take a good while to get food. \n\nThe food is AWESOME! Worth any little complaints I might think up before it gets there. Once its on the table, I forget them all.\n\n-Fish Sandwiich\n-Salmon (huge and delicious)\n-Flounder\n-Shrimp a few ways (\""Norfolk\"" style is oily for my taste, and I never had it growing up in Norfolk.)\n-Hawkins St Special\n-Prime Rib (sized for two, watch it)\n\nThe prices are low, the portions are large, and just about everything on the menu  is delicious. I'm not one to pick a place because they give you a lot of food, but if you like a good value and don't want to compromise on taste, this place is a gem."
1,"Old school.....traditional \""mom 'n pop\"" quality and perfection. The best fish and chips you'll ever enjoy and equally superb fried shrimp. A great out of the way, non-corporate, vestige of Americana. You will love it."
1,Good fish sandwich.
1,"After a morning of Thrift Store hunting, a friend and I were thinking of lunch, and he suggested Emil's after he'd seen Chris Sebak do a bit on it and had tried it a time or two before, and I had not. He said they had a decent Reuben, but to be prepared to step back in time.\n\nWell, seeing as how I'm kind of addicted to late 40's and early 50's, and the whole Rat Pack scene, stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burgh...as long as it doesn't involve 1979, which I can see all around me every day.\n\nAnd yet another shot at finding a decent Reuben in da burgh...well, that's like hunting the Holy Grail. So looking under one more bush certainly wouldn't hurt.\n\nSo off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of...where exactly were we? At first I thought we were lost, driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway. And then...AHA! Here it is! And yep, there it was. This little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply 'Emil's. \n\nWe walked in the front door, and entered another world. Another time, and another place. Oh, and any Big Burrito/Sousa foodies might as well stop reading now. I wouldn't want to see you walk in, roll your eyes and say 'Reaaaaaalllly?'\n\nThis is about as old world bar/lounge/restaurant as it gets. Plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no yinzer pics, good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. This is the kind of neighborhood dive that I could see Frank and Dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap scotch. And THAT is exactly what I love.\n\nOh...but good food counts too. \n\nWe each had a Reuben, and my friend had a side of fries. The Reubens were decent, but not NY awesome. A little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty and definitely filling. Not too skimpy on the meat. I seriously CRAVE a true, good NY Reuben, but since I can't afford to travel right now, what I find in da burgh will have to do. But as we sat and ate, burgers came out to an adjoining table. Those were some big thick burgers. A steak went past for the table behind us. That was HUGE! And when we asked about it, the waitress said 'Yeah, it's huge and really good, and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain't that nuts?' Another table of five came in, and wham. Fish sandwiches PILED with breaded fish that looked amazing. Yeah, I want that, that, that and THAT!\n\nMy friend also mentioned that they have a Chicken Parm special one day of the week that is only served UNTIL 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. If only I could GET there on that week day before 4...\n\nThe waitress did a good job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a Saturday, and only one of her. She kept up and was very friendly. \n\nThey only have Pepsi products, so I had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. As the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy.\n\nEmil's is no frills, good portions, very reasonable prices, VERY comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall...kind of like Cheers, but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950's. Fan-freakin-tastic! I could feel at home here.\n\nYou definitely want to hit Mapquest or plug in your GPS though. I am not sure that I could find it again on my own...it really is a hidden gem. I will be making my friend take me back until I can memorize where the heck it is.\n\nAddendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich. Excellent. Truly. A pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun (as opposed to da burgh's seemingly popular hamburger bun). The fish was flavorful, the batter excellent, and for just $8. This may have been the best fish sandwich I've yet to have in da burgh."
1,"Let there be no question: Alexions owns the best cheeseburger in the region and they have now for decades. Try a burger on Italian bread. The service is flawlessly friendly, the food is amazing, and the wings? Oh the wings... but it's still about the cheeseburger. The atmosphere is inviting, but you can't eat atmosphere... so go right now. Grab the car keys... you know you're hungry for an amazing cheeseburger, maybe some wings, and a cold beer! Easily, hands down, the best bar and grill in Pittsburgh."
1,"Cheap, unpretentious, and, for this, one of my favorite breakfast joints in the country.  Simply put I LOVE it here.  The mixed grill, the sausage and egg on a biscuit, the home fries.  This it the very definition of diner.  Thank you Gab 'n' Eat!"
1,Love this place.  Never had a bad meal.  Good portions and great people.  Be ready to stand in line.
1,"BEST DINER IN THE COUNRTY!!! We've been to many famous diners across the country and we still give  Gab and Eat the best rating !! I was a little intimidated when I first walked in and there was like 2 pounds of butter just sitting on top of the homefires on the grill.  If you are looking for a healthy breakfast they probably can accomodate you, but Everything I ate was clearly the opposite of healthy.  After trying like every meal they have I would recommend the mix grill(half unless you are sharing) adding cajun seasoning with the texas toast.  Burgers are great too.\n\nIt's hard to find a place that makes a better breakfast than you could make by yourself at home, but this place does it.  The atmosphere is classy, old school Americana."
1,"I always love a good diner.  Gab and Eat was just what we were looking for on a Saturday morning.  Good food.  Great people. Pittsburgh ambiance. \n\nThis place is obviously a beloved neighborhood gem.  I had french toast and bacon.  The french toast was made with the best Italian bread.  My fiance had what they called a 'mixed grill.\""  It consisted of eggs, peppers, onions and home made sausage.  Not something you would eat everyday, but he loved it!   They also had great coffee.  They actually ground up the beans in front of us.  Now that's fresh.\n\nWe want to return sometime for \""turkey day.\""  Apparently they made fresh turkey every Tuesday.  Now that sounds good!\n\nCan't wait to return."
1,"I have been coming to Gab n Eat for almost 20 years and They have never let me down. I get a typical breakfast if eggs, ham, toast, and home fries. Delicious as usual. The ambience however is usually lacking. The walls are dark, with writing and signatures of semi famous people all over the place. Pictures of local people hang on the walls(i secretly want mine up there) along with posters galore. While its fun to look at the first 10 times, it gets a little boring after awhile. So today when I arrived I expected the same old experience. Wow was I wrong! As soon as I looked at the door I knew something was different. The place seemed lighter and brighter. To my pleasant surprise, they painted and got new counter tops!! They're not quite done yet but the place has a new Happy vibe to it. The awesome breakfast, the new decor and the 5 guys sitting at the counter making me laugh are why I will be back( maybe for lunch)."
1,"What a find! I stopped in here for breakfast while in town for business. The service is so friendly I thought I was down south. The service was quick, frankly and felt like I was with family. \nFantastic poached eggs, Cajun homefries and crispy bacon. Gab and Eat is definitely a place I world recommend to locals. I was stuffed and the bill was only $8.00."
1,Great little place. Treats you like a local.Eaten here 3 times a week for a month.  Same overtime. Barb is always here.
1,Tonya is super sweet and the front desk people are very helpful
1,"I needed alterations done to my suit very quickly. Like three days quickly. Not only did Filberto at Alteration World have it ready, the price was beyond reasonable and the work was EXCELLENT! I plan on bringing all my clothes to him from now on.\n\nOh and he let me know that they also dry-clean. Wonderful shop!"
1,"This location never disappoints!! Food is always consistently great, and if you come at the right time, (witching hours) you may see the cook singing and dancing along with the music in the back. And it is awesome! ! Love this place!!"
1,"I brought my husband and my parents all to Papa J's last time my husband and I were in Pittsburgh. My parents are really picky about their italian food, usually they drive places in east bumf*@ (tarentum, ligonier...) to get their capital I-talian.\n\nMy pop is kinda grumbly, and getting him to try something new is like pulling teeth. The only reason I got him here was becuase they were on their way to drop us at the airport.\n\nWell, my dad goes back now regularly and that says a lot, considering he lives in Murrysville. \n\nThe first good sign Dad was happy was that he seemed impressed when it was open- it was noon a few days after Christmas. Second good sign was that Dad ordered wine, at it was only 1 pm. Dad, while not a teetotaler, rarely has a drink before 5 pm so I know he was anticipating a good meal. The kicker was that he was so happy he left our waitress a $20 tip on a $50 meal. \n\nCan I say, I live in Texas now and I still relive this afternoon back in December? I had chicken picatta...it was perfect. My dad had eggplant rollatini, my mom had a pizza, and my hubby had basic pasta and marinara. It all was amazing, delicous, and inexpensive. In Austin, you can't get a decent italian meal, much less a decent italian meal for under $50 for four people.\n\nI know there are so many good Italian places in Pittsburgh but I just think back so fondly on this day...when me Dad liked someplace I took him :)"
1,"What a wonderful surprise found in Carnegie PA, just south of Pittsburgh.  I was in town on business with a couple co-workers and after having a not so great meal the night before, we asked one of the locals for a recomendation.  They told us to try this little Italian place called Papa J's and boy did they send us to a great place.\n\nFirst off, when you walk up to the place, the front and side windows give you a fantastic open view into the kitchen from the outside.  You can stand outside and watch the chef making all the wonderful food and you can smell the fresh bread before you even walk in the door.\n\nI am not sure how long this place has been around but the kitchen looked well used, while the dining area as well as the bar looked very clean and modern, almost as if it had been freshly updated.  \n\nThe server was quick to welcome us and suggested several different items off the menu as his favorites when asked.  The three of us were very hungry and wanting to try a few different things, so we began with a Margherita pizza which was absolutely perfect.  They obviously make their own breads and dough for the pizza and I don't think this pizza could have tasted any better.  Then came bowls of Italian wedding soup which was pretty good.  Of everything there, this was the one item I probably could have done without.  Not that it was bad, but there was nothing particularly special about it.  \n\nWe also ordered the Garlic Rolls (not that the bread they already give you and the pizza was not enough carbs for 1 meal) and they were to die for.  Crunchy on the outside and warm and chewy inside, these things were a meal by themselves.  One of the guys with me said the pizza sauce would be good on them so he ordered a cup of the pizza sauce (which is fresh made there, not out of some can) and he was right.  As if these little killer bread balls with garlic were not good enough, dipped in the pizza sauce they were even that much better.  \n\nBy the time our meals came, we were all pretty full, but we pushed on and continued to eat.  I had the Veal Parmigiano which was tender and very good.  It came with a side of pasta which I tasted just to try and it was excelent as well.  Had I not been eating a weeks worth of carbs in one sitting with all the pre-meal stuff, I certainly would have finished it.  As it was, I ate most but not all of the generous portion of veal.  \n\nOne of my co-workers had the Chicken Picatta which he said was one of the best he had ever had and the other guy tried a pasta dish which he said was very good as well.  \n\nThey had a great wine selection as well at reasonable prices by the glass or bottle.\n\nOverall a fantastic experience with great food and atmosphere.  I don't really know how expensive the area is for food, but coming from the Chicagoland area, I fouknd this place to be pretty reasonable.  The three of us ate very very well for an average of aproximately $30 each not including alcahol.  Fantastic fresh food at a reasonable price, who could ask for more.\n\nMy only complaint is that I had to return to Chicago and I am now craving to return to Papa J's.  I hope work sends me out here again sometime soon!!!"
1,"I love this place! The food is always so fresh and delicious. The staff is always friendly, as well."
1,It was just what we were looking for. The service was great. My husband had the veal sausage on green pepper appetizer in the larger size. It was great (spicy) and enough for a meal. I had the stuffed eggplant. That was very good but the sauce could have been a bit heartier. I would definitely go back. Really nice atmosphere and free parking in the back.
1,Some of the best chow around--love this place. The bread and salads and soups are great.
1,"Finally, great Tuscan-style Italian food in Pittsburgh, not that tasteless stuff that locals think is Italian.\n\nThe bread was warm and fresh. The bolognese sauce was creamy and rich, and unlike most restaurants was made with veal. I love the fresh smell of baking bread throughout the restaurant.\n\nI'm looking forward to working my way through the menu of chicken options, and next time, I'm saving room for dessert! The display of cakes and pastries at the door was amazing."
1,Great location!  Close to shops and theatre.  Nice staff.
1,"This Starbucks is 5-Star Friendly. The shift supervisor Lucious keeps the energy in there moving and light. He recently helped me with a merchandise return and embodied everything a good manager and all around mensch person should - patience, kindness, generosity and fairness. I left that afternoon loving Starbucks even more than when I went in. It's great that a company and their employees can be as loyal to their customers as their customers are to them."
1,"Love this store!  Don't always have much luck with the sales, but I always find something I like here.  This isn't your average Marshall's or TJ Max.  I think the green dress I'm wearing is from Filene's!"
1,Had a great time at Sing Sing a while ago with friends.  Friendly staff.  Will return.
1,"Sing Sing is awesome!! Give a buck or more and they will play anything, and if they don't know it, they will search for who requested the song so they can do something else the person will enjoy! :) Great humor too!! :)"
1,"What a great time!  This place was awesome!  I wish I lived right down the road, because I could see myself being a regular here.\n\nHonestly, these guys have got some talent, like real talent.  They can play the piano, sing, play guitar, and the drums.  Did I mention that they are all pretty hilarious, too.  I'd easily pay the $7 cover to get in here any day because it really is worth it.  \n\nI am sure I will be back in no time at all.  Next time, I am bringing a big group of friends."
1,"Went here for the first time this past weekend. Needless to say I'll be returning! It was a blast!!!\n\nIt was cheap to get in and since we got there a bit earlier we got a semi-good table. Though it was very annoying that people had reserved tables right up front and never showed up. WHAT IS WRONG WITH THESE PEOPLE?! Everything if you ask me! Seriously though if you're going to reserve a table, you better freaking go! \n\nI had no complaints about the place itself! The guys were hilarious and watching my brother get made fun of multiple times was just the cherry on top! Anddd this has to be the only place I've ever enjoyed being around people who were sloppy drunk, because the comedians take no prisoners! \n\nI did enjoy when Matt and Joey were the ones up there because they are just amazing and make it so much better! They are great at what they do. Can't wait to go back!"
1,"The food here can actually be a little hit and miss, but I love the grilled cheese club with fries. I get it way too much. People make fun of me.\n\nThey have a ten dollar minimum for credit cards, fyi."
1,"Dave and busters is the best place to eat and play games. There is many fun games and prizes to win. I highly suggest if you want to plays games, go Wednesday when all the games are half off. Food is pretty good and a nice bar. The downside is that the booze is pretty pricey."
1,"First off, let me say that I find the people who usually work at Dave and busters usually don't care or seem to be angry and hate their job. A friend and I went here and found that a couple of the machines ran out tickets and someone was always there and happy to help. The staff went out of their way to make sure we had a good time. The manager Tony was very sweet and made sure everything was ok. Every staff member we talked to was extremely nice. This is by far the best Dave and busters I've had been to!"
1,"I rarely give a business a superior rating, but I have to say my wife and I had one of the best dining experiences at the Rock Bottom Brewery.   The food was delicious,  the beer, every recipe sampled,  was amazing and the service was wonderful.  The staff made us feel like we were the most important guests in the restaurant. \n\nPlease support this business.  I guarantee you will not be disappointed."
1,"Planned a surprise birthday party here for my wife and they did an amazing job helping to pull it off! Service was extremely helpful, professional, and on point all night. Lauren (one of the managers) was reliable and pleasant throughout the entire planning process. If anyone is looking to plan an event I would highly recommend Rock Bottom. Couldn't be happier!"
1,"This is the best Giant Eagle in the area and is the most like grocery stores in Bay Area. Here's why:\n\n1. They sell beer!\n2. Huuuuuge produce selection\n3. Natural/organic foods section: cereal, pasta, soups, etc and fancy chocolate bars\n4. Long isle of ethnic foods includes mexican, indian, italian, asian and , of course, jewish\n5. Functioning bakery with fresh, appetizing breads and desserts (I am still loyal to Allegro Hearth though)\n\nThe store is huge and I haven't been to all of it yet but they also have nicer flowers, balloons, home/seasonal section, DVD rentals and a photo center as well as a drive-through pharmacy. \n\nIt seems as this GE just might be the answer to my grocery stores woes."
1,"Probably the most comprehensive supermarket in the county, if not all of southwestern PA. Its selection is considerably larger than what you can find in most Giant Eagles, and it has more upscale items. I live an easy walk from the Swissvale Giant Eagle, but I often drive to this location for the superior selection."
1,"This is easily one of the best Giant Eagles I've ever been to. Huge. Very nice selection. Easily comparable to Whole Foods. Went to their cheese market, and was pleasantly surprised with the selection. I got Beemster Vlaskas, an amazing Gouda. Very large parking lot."
1,Such nice staff.  \n\nI really lament the decline of the modern bookstore.  I really enjoy browsing and picking up a new book.  \n\nThe store has a great selection and the staff are always helpful and kind.  \n\nI really hope this store stays here for some.  The prices are also fair and often have great discounts.
1,$1 burger night on Tuesday. Add ons more.
1,"For some reason, I had a tremendous amount of anxiety about buying a new mattress. Maybe I was just self-conscious about rolling around on a bunch of beds in a public place. \n\nABD Mattress quickly alleviated any idiotic fears I may have had. The store was empty when I arrived on a Monday afternoon and I was attended to immediately and never felt pressured. ABD has a great selection of mattresses, and the prices cannot be beat. I picked up a full plush pillow-top mattress for a cool $375 (without a box spring or a frame, since I already had one). Better yet? Delivery is free AND prompt. You pick a three-hour timeframe, and the store will call you on the day of delivery to narrow it to a one-hour slot so you're not sitting around all afternoon."
1,"I'm a mattress buying novice. I also hate buying things that require you to try-before-you-buy. I also seem to give explanatory information about myself before reviews. Anyway. \n\nI had a lot of anxiousness about buying a mattress. If it's terrible, you'll be spending a large proportion of your life in misery until you fix the problem. Who wants that? Especially for something that can be as expensive as a mattress? \n\nThese people were great. They patiently answered all of my mattress questions and treated me like a valued customer - both times I called, the man on the phone remembered my name (and number!) and took care of me. When I failed to buy a box spring (why oh why did I think I could go without a box spring??) they were able to take care of me over the phone and get me a box spring in the SAME day. Within hours, even. They even helped me set up the mattress that I DIDN'T purchase from them, which blew me away. \n\nTheir professionalism and friendliness are excellent. I will recommend them to everyone who's in the market for a mattress, especially students, because their student deals are fantastic."
1,"Great customer service.  I was in Pittsburgh for business and needed a car to get back to the airport.  I found these guys on Yelp, and the reviews were not wrong.  It was easy to order the car and pick-up was prompt."
1,"Our family loves this restaurant.  My children and I suffer from food allergies.   I have Celiac's Disease and their gluten free selection for a Chinese restaurant is great.  My children are a completely different ball game.  They have a rare disease called Eosinophilic Esophagitus where food attacks their body.  They are very limited on their food selctions due to not being able to consume any food with gluten, soy, eggs, dairy, nuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, amd corn.  This restaurant takes special care of my kids by making sure they get chicken that has not gone through the egg wash.  The servers and managers are all trained in how to be careful.  Our favorite manager is Joe and favorite server is Kevin.  Call ahead if you have any questions and they will answer your questions."
1,"This place hit the spot. \n\nStopped here before a movie and ate at the bar. We got just what we wanted: quick service and some good eats. \n\nI recommend the fried green beans with aioli  -- soooo good! Who knew I liked green beans?! And this trip I tried some sushi and got the spicy tuna roll. Although it was clearly not pieced together by an expert sushi chef, it was extremely fresh and delish (so who cares if it's not beautiful?!)"
1,Extremely helpful staff that knows exactly what shoes are comfortable yet stylish. The shoes I bought were high quality and durable. I was extremely impressed by the staff.
1,I only allow my dogs to go to Dr. Bezak. I've had a couple Chow Chow's who a lot of vets are afraid of. Doc had a Chow himself so knew what to look out for in the breed. He has taken good care of them over the years.
1,"I went in to get my suit that I bought last year tailored because I had lost some weight and I couldn't have had a better experience. When I walked in I was immediately created by Bill who was warm and friendly. Anna came out to perform the measurements and mark up the suit. She checked everything, even changes I hadn't thought to have made to make sure the suit fits me perfectly when they are done. Best of all, when I asked if they could ship the suits to me at my house since I no longer live in Pittsburgh, they asked when I was leaving town and promised they would get it done for me before I left  the next day. Better yet, they had the suit ready for me early, avoiding the rush for me to pick it up before I left. Everyone was extremely helpful and diligent and I will continue to only get changes done at this store."
1,Great on line service!!!  2nd time placing an order on line and they made it easy as far as getting the correct sizes in a timely manner.
1,"We just completed our wedding registry at the Homestead location. The customer service was outstanding! One of the employees, Chris, walked around with us to help us pick out exactly what we needed. The wedding registry coordinator, Christina, was also very helpful and accommodating. They treated us as if we were royalty. I would recommend this wedding registry without a doubt!"
1,Great location!  I love that you can substitute burger with a veggi patti and that they have gluten free bread.  Love love love the smiley cookies :)
1,"A very nice meal in a very nice restaurant\n\nPROS:\nVery good food\ninteresting choices--not your typical red lobster crap\nGreat service\nVery clean (restrooms, included)\n\nCONS:\nn/a"
1,Beautiful decor. Very genuine staff. Very clean washrooms. Delicious food. I tried the market trio. The blackened tilapia was nice with a little bit of spice. This is a great place for a seafood lover.
1,"My husband and I went to Mitchell's last summer for our wedding anniversary. We both took a half day at work and we arrived in the early afternoon (after lunch but before the dinner crowd). I can't say enough about this place...we have gone here on a few occasions and I've always been please with everything. \n\nPros: Nice friendly waitress, who took some time to take our picture (since it was our anniversary), food was excellent and not extremely overpriced, restaurant and bathrooms were clean!\n\nCons: None on this visit or any previous visits"
1,"Went for dinner Friday evening with friends and sat at the outdoor patio. It is so nice and relaxing there with the river and bike trail. The sourdough bread they serve is always hot and fresh. The Chilean sea bass just melts in your mouth, it was awesome. The Cod stuffed with shrimp and lobster was also very good. I had the carrot cake for dessert, it is big enough for 3 people. It was so delicious. My friend had the creme  br\u00fbl\u00e9e, which she said was very good. I was here 3 times this summer and every meal was excellent."
1,"This is the best experience I've had at a bike store in the Pittsburgh area.  I have been shopping around for a couple months for a new road bike (which was going to be my first road bike ever, meaning that I'm fairly clueless about how to pick one out).  Also, since I'm a student, I don't have particularly deep pockets.\n\nAt Big Bang, I was greeted basically the moment I walked in the door.  I'm kind of shy when I know that I don't really know what I'm doing, but I wasn't pressured or harassed in any way by the staff.  Even though my price range was pretty low, they still tried their hardest to find a bike that suited my needs, and they found a bike that fitted me perfectly (and gave me an *excellent* deal on the price).  They take a lot of care to make sure you're properly fitted to the bike.\n\nAlso, this is one of the few bike stores I've been to where test riding is gleefully encouraged, rather than grudgingly allowed.  Definitely it's the only bike store where they'll tell you \""You haven't tried it out enough, go climb up the hill on  it!\"" -- they definitely put the emphasis on matching rider with bike, rather than making a quick sale.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a road bike, whether they're a seasoned racer or a neophyte rider like me."
1,"Big Bang Bicycles is phenomenal! Amazing selection and service! I live in the San Francisco, Bay Area with plenty of premium bicycle shops available, but I do most of my cycling shopping at Big Bang Bicycles when I visit family in Pittsburgh. This shop carries top gear and has in stock tons of options so you can see, feel and evaluate them first hand to know what's going to give you the best feel and performance. Glenn, the owner, is very knowledgeable, friendly and you can feel his passion for cycling and making sure you get the right product and fit for you.  Even if you're not in the Pittsburgh area but you know what you want -- send your order to Big Bang Bicycles and I'm certain you'll have a great experience. Awesome shop! Thank you Glenn and team!"
1,I have been looking for 3 years for good crab rangoon - I finally found it!!!  We had boneless ribs that were absolutely wonderful.  Definitely going back!!!
1,"Ok this is my first yelp review, I never left any reviews for other restaurants, but I am writing it because I want others to know about this place more.\n\nRestaurant run by family. very friendly, clean cooking environment, and Great food. I would come to this place again and again whenever I visit Pittsburgh.\n\nIts less than 10min drive from Kennywood, if you are visiting Kennywood you should definitely try this place."
1,"Came here from PGH for the first time.  This bakery is legit.  I bought some Rye bread and Italian 5 grain.  Delicious.  A strange snickerdoodle thing with pink frosting.  Delicious. Chocolate chip cookie dipped in chocolate, extra chewy and humongous.  Delicious.\n\nAnd a sweet old lady serving em up.\n\nThe best.\n\nDelicious."
1,"Love butter? Then get thee to Pierogies Plus.\n\nI live in St. Louis, and it seems like the only pierogi I can find are in my grocer's freezer. Oh, but when I go home to Pittsburgh, I can have as much of the chewy, flavorful, buttery goodness as I desire from Pierogies Plus.\n\nThe place still looks like an old service station with a tiny building and a roof over an old gas pump island. Inside, though, magical elves... uh... I mean fabulous Polish women... create deliciousness with love -- and butter. Have I mentioned that butter is a part of the deal? Because it totally is. You really should fast for two days before picking up pierogi from here.\n\nOh, but you'll be happy you did. I'm vegetarian, so I only order meat-free pierogi. I'm in love with the saurkraut and the cheese varieties. When you pick up a hot order, you'll get your pierogi covered in with rich butter and sauteed onions. No, I'm serious -- the pierogi are SWIMMING in butter. It's the best thing ever. Everything is packed inside a styrofoam container and a plastic bag, because butter WILL spill out.\n\nYou also can order cold or frozen pierogi if you plan to, say, lug them to the middle of the country to enjoy in a far-off city.\n\nBesides many varieties of pierogi, you also can get things from the deli cases. Last time, I had some apricot blintzes, a latke and some type of apple turnover thingy. I really hope Pierogies Plus has the blintzes when I visit next.\n\nAwesome thing: Pierogies Plus usually has coupons in the Entertainment Book. My best friend and I steal all of the coupons from our families so that I can get a steady stream of discounted Polish goodness each time I visit.\n\nThe only downside is that Pierogies Plus often closes for several days around holidays. I totally understand it -- family time is important! -- but that often coincides with my visits (I head east around the holidays mainly because I get an extra day with the fam without having to take another vacation day). I've learned to plan my trips around the Pierogies Plus schedule, though, because I MUST have yummy goodness. A pierogi-less Allison is a cranky Allison."
1,"Best pierogies in tahn!  \n\nI usually just go with the standard potato and cheese but I've also tried a few of the other pierogies and some of the plus.  These pierogies can't be beat.  Made by hand with love in the traditional old world style, I have yet to find better.\n\nIt's amazing to get there at 10:55am, 5 minutes before they open and see the mad rush of people getting pierogies.  By 11am, the line is already out the door.  Always a good sign.  They serve their pierogies hot, cold or frozen.  I always go with the hot because nothing beats pierogies bathing in butter and onions.  And here at Pierogies Plus, they are definitely worth the wait."
1,Just finished a dinner of pierogies that our Pgh family brought to WV - always look forward to Pierogies Plus - try the apricot for a sweet treet!
1,"On a random Sunday morning I went in search of a good breakfast spot.  I decided to explore the McKees Rocks neighborhood and came upon Marge's Place.  I hadn't heard much about this place, but after reading the few reviews I could find, I decided to give it a try.  \n\nInside, it's bigger than I expected but still has that down home diner feel.  My guess is that most of the people there were regulars.  The wait staff was friendly to those they knew but also welcoming to me, someone they had never seen before.  I picked a table in the corner so I could observe what I imagine was a typical Sunday morning.  I ordered the breakfast special: 2 scrambled eggs with bacon, potatoes and toast.  Any place that has Mancini's Italian toast already gets thumbs up in my book.  Being in McKees Rocks, though, they really don't have a choice.  The potatoes were thin sliced with onions and very flavorful.  The only way I can think of to describe the bacon is...porkier.  Is that even a word?  I just don't know how else to descibe it.  The combination of foods was served in generous portions at a great price (under $5).  \n\nOne random note: I liked the tables and chairs.  They were comfortable not just for sitting and enjoying a cup of coffee with my morning paper but also very comfortable for sitting and eating.  Good distance between the table and chairs.  That may sound silly, and I thought so, too, at first.  But when I go to a place and the booth is too wide or too narrow, it can hinder my enjoyment.  \n\nNot only will I return, but I will also recommend Marge's Place to anyone in the area.  It was a surprisingly good find.  I like places like neighborhood businesses like this where they make everyone feel like they belong."
1,"Great service, friendly staff, great food, great prices. What more can you ask for in a small town breakfast place? Will definitely be back"
1,Luigi's pizza is amazing! The sicilian pizza takes me back to how my grandma used to make homemade pizza. I can't wait to go back - definitely worth the 45-minute trip there :)
1,"This is my favorite 'event' restaurant (by which I mean, spendy, but definitely worth it for special occasions).  It is great for intimate birthdays, celebrations, etc.  Whatever karmic intervention gave the 'Bustling Borough of Bellevue' this restaurant makes me think we, as a community, has done something right. \n\nBut more importantly the food...  Oh, the food!  The owner/chef takes so much care, it makes the whole experience very enjoyable.  I have never had a bad meal.  \n\nI"
1,Yes!!!!!!\n\n\n\n\nGreat service!\nGreat Food!\nLove the BYOB!!! ($5).
1,"Let me just tell you, I have really, really difficult hair.  type 3b Naturally curly, 100% grey, I dye it dark and mess with the color myself. ( never good)  If you want to know where to get a good haircut you ask someone with my hair. Since I have been going to Mane Attractions I have really LOVED my hair. I have been going there for about 4 years. Kristi was even able to cut my curly hair into a short reverse bob without making me look like i was wearing a helmet. ( you curly girls know what I am talking about). I have had nothing but complements on my hair and even my mom( who is always honest) is impressed. The only complaint I ever have is that yes, sometimes I have gone there on the spur of the moment and it has been closed during the week. I just know to call and schedule things. it is a small business and I get it.  P.S. kids haircuts are only 10$ and My daughter loves it."
1,"Quite possibly the best bakery in Pittsburgh.  It's got everything from the low-end (cookies, cupcakes, donuts) to the high (wedding cakes, tortes, tarts).  Make any special or large orders weeks in advance.  The tastiest wedding cake I ever sampled was from here: smooth buttercream icing with alternating raspberry and lemon filling in white batter."
1,"Woo Hoo!  Dead Lady.\n\nThis thrift store rocks.  I have been doing this for more years that I haven't been, and it is the best in the city.\n\nI would make a weekly trek to RWB, and would never be disappointed.  These were the days when you could find a vintage 50s something or other on the racks, before there was a \""Vintage\"" section.  Still, recently, there is always a treasure to be had, especially in the housewares department.  The proximity of this thrift store to the affluent neighborhood of Sewickley accounts for its top-notch merch.  Whenever we'd have a particularly good day, my frends and I would joke...\""dead lady.\"""
1,"I came here all the time while I was freelancing and in charge of my own schedule.  It has a lot of points going for it that other thrift shops consistently mess up.\n\n1. It's well lit.  You can SEE the clothing, see whatever might be wrong with it, and make an honest assessment.  You're never surprised when you leave at the state of the items you've just bought.\n\n2. It is surprisingly clean.  Nothing seems to smell, so I can only imagine they've laundered everything thoroughly. \n\n3. There are good quality brands--Ann Taylor, Kenneth Cole, etc.  It's mainly items along these lines.  You're more likely to find twinsets than clubbing tops here, which if you're over the age of 21 is a good thing.\n\n4. Markdowns and fresh merchandise.  These people *know* how to turn over their stock.  Because the place is never empty, and there are specials every day, the stock flips rapidly.  The merchandise is never the same week to week, so as I mentioned before, it's addictive.  You never know what you'll find.\n\nA summary of a few things I've bought here: a 6 dollar designer knit dress, a few silk twinsets ($2-$5), countless heels, two pairs of Birkenstocks and two pairs of Doc Martens ($4-$8), a dressmaker's bust ($5), a pressure cooker ($7)....\n\nYou get the picture.  The prices aren't rock bottom, but close enough, and the quality of the clothing will help anyone but the stingiest person get over the 50 cents extra.\n\nCan't recommend it enough!"
1,"Simply the best thrift store I've ever been to. Well worth the 3 1/2 hour drive from my hometown.\n\nFirst, and foremost, EVERYTHING IS 1/2 off all of the time!\n\nSecondly, bring cash. They DO NOT accept credit cards.\n\nThe store is full of wonderful pieces of clothing, all arranged by color and type (not by size, which is unfortunate). I found a wide selection of everything from casual pieces to high-end business attire to super-trendy teen clothing... what surprised me most about this store was the QUALITY of the clothing. Almost all of the pieces were flawless, a few were worn or faded in some way and the price reflected that. Brand names were bountiful; Banana Republic, Ralph Lauren, Chico's, Jones New York, Ann Taylor, American Eagle, H&M. There were also some wonderful vintage pieces from the 80s, bright colors and crazy shoulder pads that would have made a more adventurous fashionista very happy indeed!\n\nThe clothing smells wonderful, not musty or dirty as in some thrift stores, and there was even a large selection of plus-sized clothing carefully culled out in a special section.\n\nI went to Red White & Blue to find some business attire for my new job, and came home with two gorgeous, flawless statement blazers from Ann Taylor Loft and Banana Republic... for a total of $7!\n\nCome to this thrift store; it'll make all other shopping obsolete!"
1,"Ever shopped at a Thrift Shop that sells high end labels, some brand new and gently used items like backpacks for $5? This is a great place to discover unique things. They also have daily deals such as 1/2 off of certain color tags. Have to dig through other things though to find something interesting which is part of the adventure!"
1,"I love a deal, and this has been my favorite thrift store since I was a kid.  \n\nFirst, there is some sort of half-off deal every day.\n\nSecond, the used book selection is pretty decent.  Yeah, there are a ton of self-help and Patterson mass markets that you have wade through, but T.C. Boyle for two bucks?  Yes, please.\n\nThird, the home goods.  I've gotten huge solid wood picture frames for only a couple dollars.  The art prints inside were hideous...but I threw those away, re-stained the frames to my liking, cut new mats, and inserting art quoted as $360 each to frame at a big chain fabric store for under $30.  Boom.\n\nFinally, there is a decent selection of lamp to re-wire, always lot of furniture, some diamond in the rough clothes on occasion, and lots of other wacky stuff that's just fun to sift through.\n\nCASH ONLY and the cashiers are pretty rude/lazy, but that never bothers me.\n\nBONUS:  They pick up your donations for free from your porch.  http://www.pickupplease.org/  Super easy."
1,"I love love LOVE this store. I thought the one on Saw Mill Run was great but this was i think is way awesomer. If only awesomer were a word. I love to go here and find lots of home decor items to decorate my house. candle holders, DIning sets, paints, sculptures and sooo much more. I found this small desk lamp that has a victorian look to it with the shade included for $4. The lamp shade was made of some kind of smooth material almost like leather. It's such a great find. There are plenty of items for sale at this place and most of them are in great shape. \n\nSo the clothes which occupy most of the store are the best find. The Store has certain days that offer you %50 certain color tags. I went on a Monday and it was half off yellow and white tags. Other days its half off blue, or green or red. I love to go on Saturdays!! This past week it was half off every tag except white. I found so many items for such a cheap price. $7 shirts for $3.50 and tunics for $4. Have you ever find items for $1?? I have!!! I love when I find a great shirt or sweater for $3 or less. Or when you find a brand new item with the tags on them for under $7. I bought a brand new pair of Arizona Jeans (in my size) for $5. I couldn't believe it. I was too excited.\n\nThe clothes are organized by color but not by size which is a good and bad thing. I like to shop by color since I don't wear too many yellows or purples. I can avoid those sections all together but when I do find a nice shirt in the color I want the size becomes an issue. There were a lot of nice shirt that were just too small or too big. Even when i have to pass on a nice shirt I tend to find one that's just as good at the same price. \n\nShopping here is a gold find!! My sister was the one who introduced me to this store and i used to make fun of her for shopping thrift. If I had known that It was nothing like the Good Will I would have been here a lot sooner. Now my sister makes fun f me for going so often. What an amazing place this is!! I'll probably never shop retail again!!\n\nREMINDER: CASH ONLY!!\n-But they have an ATM!! $2.50 fee"
1,Place has amazing omelettes that are almost as big as the size of the plate. You get a really big side of home fries too. This is probably my favorite place for breakfast in Pittsburgh. I generally go in and get a seat right away without waiting. Service is usually fast and friendly. Two downsides to the place. 1) they are cash only which can be an inconvenience. I never remember to have cash until I get my bill so I have to run to the ATM. 2) the seating is limited and the tables are very close to each other so people there can most likely hear your conversations. Place overall is excellent and is worth a try at least for breakfast. The lunches and dinner selections aren't bad either!!
1,Thank You Kim and Kurt! It was very nice of you guys to take the time to post your reviews on our service. We really appreciate it. We hope your clocks will continue to do well for years to come. Please dont hesitate to give us a call if there's anything else we can do for you.\n\nLisa\nPaul's Clock Repair
1,"I can not express my thanks & gratitude enough to everyone at Paul's Clock Repair.  I needed an Atmos clock repaired, which was given to me by my mother who had recently passed away.  I needed it done on a short time line since I live out-of-town and was leaving soon.  It is next to impossible to find anyone who can actually fix that type of clock especially anywhere close to where I live.  They were so accommodating and really really helped me out during a hard time.  Much thanks to Lisa for spending the time to teach my about the clock & how to take care of it and her dad for fixing it up!  My Atmos clock is now working great and looks wonderful on my mantle!"
1,"\""God this is the best eggplant that I have ever tasted!\""  was what our friend said after he took his first bite of the Sicilian eggplant served at Pino's.  My husband couldn't wait to have the seafood fra diavlo, which he had last time...again, a 10 out of 10!  I had the roasted veggie platter for my entree, which is really an appetizer--and I had to share--way too much for one person to eat.  Another comment from our friend (who was a first timer at Pino's) was that it was the best Italian dressing that he ever had.  As I write, I want to go back for dinner tonight!!\n\nForgot to mention, they also have local beers on tap (East End Brewery), the men enjoyed the Homewood brew (dark lager type beer), it's great to see the owners supporting local businesses!"
1,"Another really good meal here!  My friend and I went for soup and appetizers--and licked the plates clean!  Gazpacho, pasta fagiole, homemade bread, eggplant with mozzarella and my favorite...the roasted veggie platter.  So much food we didn't think we would eat it, but it was so good we did!  They also had their doors open and we were able to sit outside in the cool summer air--great way to kick of summer!"
1,"There was absolutely nothing not to like.  Reasonably priced wines, home style Italian cooking. Great upbeat ambience."
1,I been going to this place since the 90s and this place is the MIDDLE CLASS GE. I stopped going to this place since I got a job at whole foods. My mom went here a two weeks ago for the first tine in a long time she say that the people are still there and the place looks better and the people are a lot friendly now. \nSo if you don't what too shop at a Middle Class food store in East Liberty then go to The Market in Shadyside.
1,"According to Urbanspoon (blasphemy I know) their are like 1,100 pizza places in pittsburgh. So what is the best pizza in Pittsburgh. Everyone has an opinion and so here is mine: The best pizza in Pittsburgh is the pie comes from the place in you neighborhood that has quality ingredients, fair prices, and friendly service. Eddie's Pizza Place  is all of these things and since I live in this neighborhood this is my favorite."
1,"My wife and I have been going here for as long as we have lived in Pittsburgh, which is about 10 years.  This is our go-to Chinese restaurant, even after we moved out of the neighborhood.  I have never had a bad meal here, and I will forever love their beef chow fun!  My wife and I are moving to North Carolina in two days, and Tasty Chinese was the thing about Pittsburgh that we said we would miss the very most.  These are great folks, and I wish them the best of success in the future.  Remember, everyone, just because you read a negative review it does not mean that the food is bad!  Some people just have lousy taste buds, and many people have no idea what they are ordering to begin with.  Try things for yourself, and you will find some great food at Tasty!"
1,Home of the Italian Army.\n\nVento's is located in the East Liberty section of Pittsburgh right next to Home Depot. They have been in business forever! They are a pizza and hoagie shop. They are famous for their Italian Army hoagie. I have friends that as soon as they land in Pittsburgh they come straight to Vento's for the pizza! It is Sicilian style pizza and It is delicious! Everything is made fresh so sometimes you have to wait a little while for your food. It's best to call ahead if you're really hungry.\n\nThey have tables and booths for seating. You can even play the PA lottery there. \n\nNo debit or credit cards. CASH ONLY!\n\n(F.Y.I. There is a generic ATM that charges $1.75 to make a withdraw.)
1,"The people that work here make an unfortunate incident a breeze to work through.  I woke up one morning to find a note attached to my windshield to inform me that I was the victim of a hit and run.  The damage was minimal, but after calling it into my insurance company, they directed me to come here.\n\nWithin minutes of me hanging up my phone with the insurance company my phone was ringing to indicate that Mikes was calling to set up an appointment to get my car in for an estimate.  I set up an appointment that was convenient for me and went about my day.\n\nWhen I arrived here to have my car viewed it was quite the easy task.  My wait was minimal, the staff were polite and I wasn't being jerked around.  Within five minutes of them looking at my car, I was out the door and heading back to my place.  \n\nUnfortunately, they did not do any work to my vehicle at this point because the police are still looking into the person that hit my car.  But if we get to that step, I am confident that they could not do anything wrong in my eyes.  If their body work for a vehicle is anything like their customer service, they are definitely one of the best places to go in the city.\n\nYes people, this isn't the best neighborhood in the city, but get over it."
1,Mikes took my car after horrible repairs/service from Kenny Ross South.  The service was great and I even got to meet the owner who came out to personally speak with me on a busy Friday afternoon.  Great guys there.
1,"I had a great experience taking my vehicle to Mike's for repair after a fender bender. I used the Geico express service - I booked the estimate and repair online for the next day. When I dropped off my car, they were expecting me, it took less than 30 minutes and every single person I encountered at the shop was helpful and friendly and showed concern for me. The damage was minor, and the repairs took less than 48 hours to complete. My policy provides a rental car, and Enterprise was there when I checked in with my vehicle and the rental process was streamlined and easy. When I picked up my repaired car, it was just as efficient and friendly. Getting into an accident is frustrating and inconvenient and costly but Mike's Auto Body made the process of fixing things and getting me back on the road into a good experience. I wish more businesses treated their customers like Mike's treated me."
1,"I'm a crazy cat lady and proud of it! \n\nBeing a volunteer here has been so fulfilling on many different levels.  It has made me feel so good to be able to help out with something that I feel passionately about.  You can tell that the staff puts a lot of effort into taking care of these animals they accept in.  A lot of times people will say, oh I can't do it, it's too sad.  But the thing is, it's not.  It's actually so great because these animals come here and find loving homes instead of being on the street or in an environment that's toxic.  I rarely see animals there for a long time.  I think that's a testament to the way they are treated while they're in the facility. \n\nNow I'll admit, I'm not the biggest dog fan, so I help out in the cat shelter.  I can talk about that with a lot more knowledge than the dog side.  They just built a new cat facility on their property so they have their own shelter.  The cats are all set up in a huge room.  They have two rooms for people to play with the cats when they are looking to adopt them.  These rooms are also used for \""cat cuddling.\""  That's what I do when I volunteer.  I get to take the cats out so that they can play, be cuddled or just run around.  Then the cats are able to get out of the cages and get used to human contact. \n\nThe other great thing about the ARL is that they have foster parents who take in cats and dogs while they're waiting to be adopted.  This way, they get a great home environment and it relieves the facility of having too many animals at one time. At different points in the year the adoption rates are different depending on the amount of animals they have.  Cat rates are usually cheaper in the Spring/Summer because there's more coming in and dog rates are cheap in the late summer months.  The added bonus of adopting a pet from the ARL is that they are spade or neutered when you adopt them.  It's actually cheaper then taking them to a normal vet on your own. \n\nI would STRONGLY recommend coming here to check out the animals and hopefully find your next furry friend!  OR you can volunteer!  They have volunteer informational sessions the first Saturday of every month.  After that you only have one training session to complete and you're ready to volunteer!  \n\nJust check it out if you're curious.  You won't regret it!  Your new furry friends will appreciate it as well!"
1,I have an almost three-year-old cat named Jack that I spoil as if he were my son. I honestly never experienced the love for and from an animal until I adopted Jack from an Animal Rescue League. It was one of the best decisions I've ever made.\n\nThe shelter is great and I'll probably get another cat in the near future. Check this location out!
1,"I adopted a dog from the ARL this past spring.  During the adoption process the employees were polite and seemed genuinely happy for me.  Shortly after the adoption, I received emails from a volunteer to check in and to inquire about how the dog and I were adjusting.  A few months after the adoption, it became clear that the dog had some pretty serious anxiety and behavioral issues (please note that there is no way the shelter staff could have known about the issues while the dog was in the shelter).  I contacted the shelter and they practically  bent over backwards to help me with the dog's issues.  The dog and I participated in two sessions of behavioral classes (Lacey is wonderful and never gave up on my dog!), consulted with veterinary staff, and received constant emails from staff offering suggestions and checking in to see how I was doing.  In the end, I learned how to manage the dog's behaviors and I love the dog dearly.  Nine months later, I still receive emails from the shelter asking about the dog and offering more suggestions.\n\nI would highy suggest adopting from this shelter.  I understand that my dog is sort of a worse-case-senerio of adopting a pre-owned dog; however, this shelter will make sure you are happy with your adoption and literally will do everything in their power to ensure both you and the adopted animal are ok.  The shetler staff care deeply about the animal AND the human's well-being!"
1,This place is PHENOMENAL.\nI got my bunny here a few months ago and the ladies were so nice and helpful and they take SUCH good care of the animals.  They gave me a bit of hay and food for her that lasted me close to three months.  Then when we were leaving we saw a cage of six dwarf hamsters and they gave us a deal of 2/$10.\nI love my animals so much and I will always check here first for pets before anywhere else.
1,"This is one of my two favorite coffeehouses in town. It took me far too long to come around and love Tazza D'oro. A horrible ex of mine loved this place and I admit that this soured me. I regret the time I wasted not going here. The dark wood inside comforts me. The small tables outside are a great place to spend the summer. \n\nTazza D'Oro brews Batdorf and Bronson beans (amazing), provides Enrico pastries (amazing) free wireless (amazing) and one of the most talented and friendly staffs I've ever met (amazing). Everyone who works there is *so* nice and *so* good at what they do. \n\nThey have a small menu of local/fresh food that looks amazing, but I have never actually eaten it. The espresso served here is actually better than the average shot served at Batdorf and Bronson locations in Olympia, WA. I talked about this with one of the barristas at TD'o and they were offended - \""we calibrate our machines the same, we use the same beans, the exact same blends and milks and everything, it can't be different.\"" Sorry, Tazza D'oro, you are better. \n\nThe lines get long on weekend mornings, but they move quickly. There's a sense of community nestled here, just off the \""main drag\"" of Highland Park, between Bryant st. and the reservoir. This is where you can pick up your CSA shipment for the week, where multiple weekly bike rides originate, where there are lively discussion groups meeting nearly every day. The percentage of students is low. Like the rest of Pittsburgh, there's a good chance you'll run into someone you know, but generally I see people I like and miss, which is different than the norm in Pittsburgh for me."
1,"Tazza D'Oro has a generally European decor, with dark, rich colors and textures, and a cozy layout that makes the most of the space. The espresso is, bar none, the best I've had - including my admittedly limited travels in Italy. It's stellar espresso - rich, thick, potent without being sour or bitter, with unique nuances that vary slightly depending on the shot and the weather, but are always fantastic.\n\nThe coffee is also terrific, and Tazza D'Oro uses Batdorf & Bronson beans - the best I've ever had for home grinding. They have a good selection of pastries and cookies, as well as a broad selection of tasty sandwiches that come with a satisfying side salad.\n\nIn addition, they have a wonderful selection of teas; I'm no expert, and don't know their supplier, but the half-dozen different blends I've tried were all memorably flavorful.\n\nAll that, and it's a lovely center of community, where you can bring your laptop or a book or a friend and spend the day. No one is rushed out the door, and there almost always seems to be a little room for your studies or conversation."
1,The coffee here was excellent! Had a double espresso. Apparently their roaster is in Santa Cruz Ca. Large selection of French Press Coffees. Baked goods did not look too great but that is not why I came here. Atmosphere is very mellow and comfortable. Also has Wifi which works! Nice to find a place like this when traveling. Is in the middle of a residential area and there doesnt seem to be anything else around here.
1,"I love tazza.. Their coffees are excellent and its a great place to enjoy a relaxing evening..I also like their Baklawa, sandwiches and Brownies.."
1,"Best coffee in Pittsburgh, without a doubt. Believe the hype. I've been going here for years, and every visit is a pleasure."
1,"local, friendly businesses serving a great product DO still exist."
1,"The coffee here is amazing (I love when the baristas take the effort to make patterns in the foam). The baristas were extremely friendly and the pastries looked delicious. While there are a number of tables, Enrico's was busy even on a Friday night...I would imagine that it would be hard to find a table during peak hours."
1,"BEST COFFEE IN PITTSBURGH!\n\nYou might think there is better coffee elsewhere.  You're wrong!\n\nI love this coffee shop, and there is a second location the Gates Building at CMU that I like to go to--their panini are to die for.\n\nI love this place, and you will too!"
1,Really hard to find a good cup of coffee in the states... I'd say this is the best  cappuccino I've had since Italy.
1,"I adore this place! The light green walls are serene, the chairs and tables are comfortable, and I love their little brownies with three kinds of chocolate chips in them! The coffee is perfectly smooth and rich, which is the most important thing to get right. (I'm not into masking the taste of burnt espresso with a mocha!) If a place can provide me with a cup of coffee that doesn't taste like it will give me an ulcer, I'll be a fan for life. The only other Pittsburgh place where I've found coffee this delicious was at Commonplace Coffee in Squirrel Hill. I went to college near Chicago and come from California. I count Intelligentsia and Blue Bottle Coffee as some of my favorite places, so I mean it when I say the coffee here is wonderful. Try it out, you won't be let down."
1,"Smiley's is wonderful... filled with things to keep our trio of cats well-fed, well-treated, and well-entertained. Certainly this is not a big box store, but, honestly, I wouldn't give my pets 99% of the food, treats, or toys that can be found in those stores, so, really, Smiley's offers me a better selection of what I actually want than any big box does. (They have a very good selection of toys for cats!)  And Smiley's takes bulk orders and has the food within a few days... saving us the trouble of schlepping out to the 'burbs."
1,"The most important quality a mechanic can have is honesty. Meet Tim Walter. When I take my car to Walter's I know the service will be good, fast and won't take a chunk out of my last paycheck. Calling ahead is usually a good idea so they can fit you in..."
1,"I just want to echo what everyone else has already said about this mechanic.  My brakes gave out and I came upon the glowing reviews for Walter's, so I gave them a call.  Not only did Tim fix my car quickly and inexpensively, he actually came to pick it up himself so that I wouldn't have to spend money on a tow truck!  He's also an extremely friendly, funny guy who puts you at ease immediately.  I'll be going back there without hesitation the next time I need anything done on my car."
1,"Scenario: Get into my car at 3:30 and head to campus for a meeting. All of a sudden, the tire warning signal lights up even though I don't remember running over anything. I get out of the car to carefully inspect my tires and they feel/look completely OK. But after owning a BMW for 3 years and having constant wheel alignment/tire issues (ie. when a tire warning signal lights up, it usually means my tire's about to blow out!!), I freaked out and frantically drove my Infiniti to the first 3 auto shops on Baum Blvd. I waited at the first stop for 5-10 minutes and the guy did not get off the phone. I got back into the car and drove it over to Pep Boy's where a mechanic was outside smoking. He says I need to go through their service desk (inside their huge store) and deal with them first. I'm thinking, \""ugh. no time. I have class in 40 minutes and I'm already late to my meeting.\"" I drive past the 3rd shop and I don't even see anyone sitting at the reception desk and figure it's going to take forever to get what I'm asking for.\n\nThen, I remembered the really positive experience I had with Walter's. I decided to drive to the end of Baum Blvd. to find his place and boy, am I glad I did. As soon as I got there, the service coordinator told me to pull my car around front so that their mechanic could take a look at my tires. He stopped what he was doing to do this and told me I could just stay in my car. Then, he reassured me that my tires were OK and he proceeded to inflate them, explaining to me why the signals might have come on.\n\nFree of charge, in and out within 5 minutes, and helpful/reassuring. I love this about Walter's Automative. They're not out just to make money. They genuinely just want to help. Highly reccommend!!"
1,"Great place. I take my car there for everything. Inexpensive, friendly, and knowledgeable. They've fixed my tire, taped a broken hose temporarily, and done other things for no charge several times. I'd definitely recommend them."
1,I thought I need an alignment and turns out all I needed was a tire balance. I stopped by he had me go with him and we drove around the block. I didn't cost me a thing because the tire balance was under warranty. Really  nice guy.
1,"I had to get a new mechanic since I recently moved here. That worried me, a lot, as I own a VW. Thankfully I found all these reviews on Yelp about Walters and decided to give it a shot. \n\nRules about Walters: Plan at least two weeks ahead for an appointment. It is worth it. \n\nFrom there you don't have to worry about anything. On my particular car I always have to fix the suspension, and I ended up needing the same repair from last year. Last year I spent $1,300 from my very reasonable and trustworthy mechanic I had been using for years at home. This year Walters quoted me just under $700. I was pretty blown away by that considering the other place I go to is just as down to earth as Walter's.\n\nWalters took the time to put my tennis racquets in my trunk and remove my aftermarket stereo so they wouldn't be seen. He explained everything to me thoroughly and was really friendly when I came to pick up my car. \n\nI know a lot about cars and mechanics since I've worked at a dealership and the honesty of Walters still amazes me. I will take my car here every time I need to get something done, even if I get a newer car with a warranty from a dealership."
1,"Hands down a great experience! I called yesterday as the driver headlight on my car was out and asked if I needed to make an appointment. The woman on the phone said to just stop right by during their hours. I went by this morning and their (small) lot was full so I just sat in my car while I believe who was Tim was finished chatting with another guy. I continued to sat in my car for a couple of minutes while Tim quickly inspected my headlight. Unfortunately he did not have any replacement bulbs but ordered them right on the spot while I was there and told me to come back any time in the afternoon. Fast forward a few hours later. I  just popped by and after popping my hood and going into their office to pay, my headlight was replaced! Friendly, honest, fair and quick service. No BS. Highly recommend Walter's Automotive."
1,"I have an older car and so sometimes things go wonky. One night I had to drop it off because it was barely running and I had no idea why. This was the first time I went to Walter's, turns out that it was only an oil changing problem. Car places usually screw me over because I know nothing about cars, but Walters did not. They are really great and fix the car for your needs. Yesterday I returned for inspection and once again he treated me fairly and only mentioned things that I already knew needed work. I would recommend this place to anyone with an older car and wants an honest car repair man. Walter's will definitely be getting my business in the future!"
1,Honest. Reliable. Trust Worthy.\n\nTim goes above and beyond with his service. He came to my house 3x one day to check everything he could before I ended up towing it to the garage. I will definitely go back!
1,"Extremely honest, great work and amazing prices. I had them repair a wheel issue on my car. For no charge the mechanic also hid some wires I never got around to moving for the DYI back-up camera I installed."
1,"Named for Pittsburgh greats, Gene Kelly and Billy Strayhorn, this historic theater is a real gem.  Originally the Regent, built in 1914, the building was renovated in 2000 as a performing arts center for theater, dance, music and film.  I have been to several fundraisers hosted by the Kelly Strayhorn, and they have always been first rate.  Also, I recently attended the Kelly Strayhorn's own fundraiser, Full Bloom, which was lots of fun.  As a venue, this place is definitely worth your attention, and the staff seems to bend over backward to make sure events go off without a hitch."
1,Plays well with a Tazza latte around the corner! The quiche was divine and the the biscuits were what I imagine my mom would have made had she actually made biscuits. Two words: YUM-OH! Cannot wait to return to the Steel City so I can partake in some of the desserts.
1,"This place has probably some of the best pastries I've ever encountered.  The treats are consistently great to amazing to even mouth watering.  The bakery is this quaint little place that is really cute with nice baking decorations and everything.  The staff is really friendly and always helpful with making the hard selection.  The cupcakes are these cream-stuffed pieces of heaven, and their signature sandwiches are out of this world.  Everything else leaves nothing to be desired, and keeps me coming back as frequently as I can find someone to accompany me."
1,"My sister, husband, and I went in after early dinner. It was completely unplanned but we were attracted to the quaint storefront. We purchased a crispy elephant ear-like dessert sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. It was glorious. I bought a piece of apple-walnut-cinnamon sugar cake with cream cheese frosting. It was delicious an moist. We also purchased freshly baked chocolate chip cookies. They were absolutely rich and scrumptious. The woman who was there an greeted us seemed like she might be the owner. She was sweet and very helpful. Great disposition. This is probably my favorite small bakery in Pittsburgh. Delightful."
1,"Food glorious foooood, hot sausage and MUStard...\n\nActually they don't sell hot sausage and mustard but, you know. \n\nThey do have amazing ham and cheese sandwiches, that are kinda pricy, but oh so good. And if you want them, you better get there early on the weekend! They're small, so get 2 for yourself at least :)\n\nWe've also tried the Nutella tart, which i've had twice now because it's SO DELICIOUS. The fruit tart is not bad, cinnamon buns are great, jewish pizza is ok (not what I was expecting - it's kinda like a fruitcake - like the dreaded holiday kind - but denser and drier), strata (eggy bread dish) which was pretty good, key lime cake - so so good, and quiche (good). \n\nSeating is hit or miss, since there's only a few tables (3 of them seat 4 people, 1 seats 2 people). On a quieter morning you should be able to find a seat. They serve coffee as well (nothing to write home about), $2 a cup, but if you like coffee with your dessert like me, it's nice to have."
1,"Came across this place after checking out a Thai restaurant across the street. The name intrigued my family and I, and it looked like adorable from the outside. \n\nI fell in love instantly. And came back several times after first discovering this hidden gem. You walk in and the wonderful smells just overwhelm you in just an amazing way. The ambiance is that of an old style kitchen- personally, it reminds me of one of my aunts kitchens, which gives it that homey feel that is so comforting. They have seating- which I never saw in any bakeries prior to this one. They also serve coffee and encourage you to take a seat and enjoy your sweet treat. \n\nThey offer such a unique array of sweets. Definitely not your typical bakery. Pies, tortes, mooses and cookies.. And when they do have cinnamon rolls, grab them! They are a hot commodity! My personal favorite is their key lime pie. Oh my goodness. It's amazing. They have had it every time that I came, thank goodness. Their key lime cake is phenomenal as well. Their fruit tarts are incredible, the chocolate moose is amazing- they have a lot of items with fresh fruit which I love! \n\nMy only critiques- the hours: they are closed on Mondays and Sundays :/, not ideal for someone whose only day off is typically Sunday. And also, they write all the items thy have in the case on a small chalkboard posted on the wall to the right of the case. Every time I go, I find myself asking the employees what everything is, which I find to be a little annoying. Regardless- it's worth it. It's such a hidden gem and going there and experiencing their sweets is a real treat."
1,"I moved to Pgh from San Francisco in 2010, and every single dealing I've had with AAA since I moved here has been great -- straightforward, super helpful people, and mostly quite brief wait times. \n\nThe agent that I have worked with from the start, whose name I think is Heather (long dark hair, second desk from the left), has always been willing to spend as much time with me as I needed to understand what I was buying and/or the process that I needed to go through.\n\nAlso, my car was totaled a couple of years ago (some jagoff who was texting rear-ended me, ahem, please don't do this), and they were phenomenal. I had a check for the full amount in less than a week.\n\nI see a lot of negative reviews here for services that are title related. I don't know if those people are even AAA employees, they might be DOT for all we know. I've had three title transactions, including one for a car that was from out of state, and they all went smoothly. \n\nI've been with AAA for more than 40 years, and when I lived in California I was seriously considering switching. Not anymore."
1,Among the best of the 'burgh.  Great live acts on a regular basis.
1,"Dear Shadow Lounge, \nI miss you. You're wonderful in every way. The dance parties, the live music, the poetry slams, the local art, the totally reasonable drink prices, the cute and chill proprietor eye candy...I could go on. \n\nStay awesome. \n\nXoxo,\nAndrea"
1,"As a Brooklyn based live indie-electronic/hiphop performer that travels, Shadow Lounge is by far one of my all time favorites.  As a Pittsburgh native remembering it's first opening when it was just bboys, graff heads, MC's and DJ's doing their local thing, it's amazing to see this place has become so professional, original, and really stands-out and is positively active for the community and continuing growth of Pittsburgh.  The service is delightful on both sides (AVA/Shadow Lounge), the prices are just right, the sound system is a complete BANGER with crisp and clean sound.   The crowd is mad cool and always responsive to good music.  Shadow Lounge really holds it down for Pittsburgh's scenes no matter the genre.  Can't visit Pittsburgh without stopping by Shadow Lounge."
1,"Went several nights in a row: Thursday, Saturday & Sunday. I cannot say enough how much I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!! Every night was different: African night, Latin Dance, Brass Band (that was amazing). The Ownership is way friendly & open to chatting which I love. The bartenders are open, friendly & genuine...anyone who remembers my name & my drink is a winner in my book! It shows they are listening when they actually ask you a question! The ownership was willing to allow us to order & set on fire a Flaming Dr. Pepper.....had to bring a little Southern treasure North! ;)\n\nI love the diverse, yet open and friendly crowd each night. I felt right at home.\n\nNow for the real surprise....THE FOOD!!!\n\nWe ordered the~\n\nTortas 7.00...we got one Chicken & one Steak..both were perfect!\n\nSandwiches with your choice of tofu or breaded chicken.  Served on toasted bread or multi-grain wrap with melted mozzarella cheese, fried bean spread, avocados, tomatoes, and onions. Topped with a chipotle sauce\n\nCheese Steak Torta 9.00\n\nGrilled steak served on toasted bread or multi-grain wrap with onions, peppers, mozzarella cheese, fried bean spread, topped with guacamole and chipotle sauce\n\nI was shocked & amazed at how wonderful this \""bar food\"" was. The tortas were great & the guacamole homemade. \n\nI will be back every time I am in Pittsburgh!"
1,"Absolutely amazing! Great staff and service! Best music in Pittsburgh, hands down.  Good work guys!"
1,"One of the most eclectic venues in Pittsburgh. Shadow Lounge has a great variety of acts that it pulls in.\n\nI just went to their Titletown Soul & Funk Party and it was a really great time. Great music, fun crowd, pretty decent prices on drinks. I'll definitely be going back for Titletown and in general, Shadow Lounge is a great place to see alternative acts in Pittsburgh."
1,I love this store. I can just spend hours walking around getting ideas of things to either update or change around my house.\n\nAll of the sales associates are very helpful and knowledgeable. Sometimes it's hard to find someone to help you because they are busy helping other customers.\n\nThey even cut keys that actually work.
1,"I went to a yelp event here, where we were able to make a fused glass piece and also watch some demonstrations and go to the gallery. Everything in the gallery was amazing. The demonstrations were neat, and the fused glass was something I would go back to do again.\n\nI really didn't know that the glass center was open most of the time, and if you go there on any random day, you can watch whatever is going on. I think that is pretty cool! They also have classes where you can blow glass or make beads or whatever you want... I can't wait to pick up my piece and come back for another class!"
1,Got my hair done in an updo (for only $25!!!!)  yesterday for my wedding.  they did amazing!  they listened to what i wanted and although it took quite a while (i have really long hair) she spent the time to do it right and exactly how i wanted it.  great service!!   The price is not high but the quality is!
1,Great for a quick cut.  $22 for extreme attention to detail and excellent finish.
1,Great Hoagies! \n\nI always get the Steak Deluxe hoagie and my wife gets the Italian Deluxe and then we give each other half of the other ones hoagie because we can never decide on with one to get.
1,"AH!  I am never shopping anywhere else for groceries ever again (except if I want like ketchup and bologna and stuff-- then I'll have to go to giant eagle.)  But, after coming from the middle of nowhere midwest, I cannot tell you how good it feels to see cheese and meat in the grocery store that I actually want to eat.  \n\nAH!"
1,"I love shopping here. The staff is really nice, no attitudes. Even the other shoppers are kind. It's always nice. Thanks to everyone for making Whole Foods a nice shopping experience."
1,"Alright, so I braved this place yesterday (new years eve) and it was totally insane. There was honking, some road rage and confusion. But I will say that I should have known better coming into a grocery store before a major partying holiday.  \n\nAnyway, in terms of produce this place is awesome. I got my meat and bacon from this joint and have not been disappointed. I also love their premade hamburgers. They are delish. This is also a great place to find a great assortment of cheeses and grass fed butter ( I go for the kerry gold products, they are just awesome).  \n\nAlso if you are grilling and dont want to cook too many sides, you can pick up some of their sides from their deli section. I haven't had a bad experience with their food and you can always give everything a taste before having the clerk put it in a container.  This is certainly the place to get specialty items like hemp seeds, chia seeds, and other natural dietary supplements... just beware they are not cheap. Overall, whole foods is not cheap, but if you want quality this is the place to go. Just dont go here on New Year's Eve or Christmas Eve... you'll end up ripping your hair out!!"
1,"TimeBomb is without a doubt the best spot in Pittsburgh to get all the exclusive Raw street merchandise. This is my favorite store in the city not only because of it's selection of merchandise, but for it's uniqueness. \n\nThe owner Brick who started the store in '95 I believe is a great guy who always takes care of his loyal customers. I've received free apparel, stickers, DVDs, mixtapes, you name it from Brick. He's a man who knows how to keep his customers coming back! \n\nAll in all TimeBomb is the place to shop in Pittsburgh if you're looking to \""Get Your Life Right\"""
1,"I first found the Newman Chiropractic Center about 2 years ago when one day, my lower back pain got so severe I could barely walk. I called one or two other Chiropractic offices first and neither could see me that morning or even that same day. Dr. Novak at the Newman Chiropractic Center was able to see me immediately and since that day, I've never even thought about going anywhere else. Whenever I need an adjustment, I simply call ahead and let them know I'll be stopping in; they are extremely flexible and understanding of my busy schedule.\n\nI look forward to visiting the office for an adjustment because I know that when I leave, I will feel amazing. The office itself is not as posh as you might find other places in Shady Side but it's welcoming, comfortable, and certainly gets the job done. \n\nI have and will continue to highly recommend Dr. Novak to anyone who is need of Chiropractic care."
1,"As the reviews of Casbah appear to be particularly long-winded ... the place is nice, fancy, organic-ish, alternating menu, nice atmosphere. Good date restaurant. Good food-lovers restaurant."
1,"This is my favorite Big Burrito restaurant and definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the country. \n\nGotta be honest, though. Just about every time I'd been here, it's with colleagues, which means lots and lots of boozing!! Therefore, consequently, as a result, in sum, I don't have a crystal clear memory of what I had for appetizer, entree, dessert, etc. \n\nWhat I can tell you is that I had never been disappointed with anything I've ordered here. And believe you me, if the food is not that good, I will remember it no matter how drunk I am. Sure, it's not exactly a \""Mediterranean\"" restaurant, but who cares? The food is great, it's in a super cute hood, the atmosphere is cozy and comfy, and the service is always spot on. \n\nI do recall that the very last time I ate here was with a dear friend and two of her British colleagues, and we had ourselves a grand ol' time. I had the arugula --one of my favorite words. It's lovely, no? Say it with me. A -ru-gu-la! Fun, right?!! And so flavorful!! --salad and cioppino, which was outstanding with super freshy fresh ingredients. What about dessert, you ask? Sorry, kids. By that time I really was drunk, and I can't remember. It was super tasty, though! I remember everyone liking mine the best. Sure do, sugar!\n\nSo pay no mind to others' taxonomy quip and give this place a whirl. It's a great date or small group place. Oh, and super fantastic wine list, too!"
1,"Hard to remember another restaurant that hit home runs from start to finish.  Yinzes say it's pricey but I disagree, the quality is hard to find period.  Very progressive menu but not too wild, products are from near area farms, very knowledgable staff.  And butter served at the right temperature, that's a novel idea!  Just a great experience, can't wait to get back there."
1,"casbah is the last big burrito restaurant i had left to try and i really liked it. i started with the sangria to drink which was delicious, and i'm usually not a huge fan of sweet drinks like that. we split the grilled flatbread app. the dips weren't anything super special, but the bread was thick and flavorful. no complaints. then we both got piccola gusta and split all our items. (the piccola gusta gives you salad or soup, half a sandwich, and half a pasta) between the two of us we had the tomato & basil bisque, arugula salad, crab cake sandwich, salumi sandwich, orecchiette pasta, and ricotta cavatelli.\ni'm not a big fan of tomato soup, in fact, i never eat it, but i tried the bisque and loved it. it tasted more like a tomato sauce than soup. the arugula salad was great as well. the crab cake sandwich was really small but good, and the salumi sandwich was amazing... probably my favorite part of the meal. both pastas were good, but i personally preferred the orecchiette, the cranberries sealed the deal for me.\ni love the atmosphere, we sat out on the covered patio, and the service was great as well.\ni'll definitely be back again, hopefully to try the different brunch and dinner menus!"
1,"Casbah is definitely my favorite restaurant in P-burgh; in fact, usually when I go somewhere else I wind up regretting that I didn't just go to Casbah. Every dish I've had has been excellent; some favorites are the sheep's milk gnudi, tuna tartare, arugala salad, bread pudding, and pretty much every soup. The short rib ravioli is a must have although arguably a touch salty. The menu is so inventive!"
1,"My wife and I go to Casbah every year for my birthday. It is my favorite of the Big  Burrito restaurants, and they have a birthday deal for $30 off an entree. \n\nThis time I started with the Parsnip & Chestnut Soup, garnished with braised chicken, arugula & almond pesto. It was divine, with the rich sweetness for which parsnips are noted. My main course was Elysian Fields Farm Lamb Loin with flageolet beans, merguez sausage, turnips, greens and whole grain mustard. It was cooked perfectly pink, as ordered, and the flavors complemented each other.\n\nFor dessert, I skipped my usual chocolate - they offered Chocolate Mousse, Chocolate Cheesecake and Dark Chocolate Raspberry Bread Pudding. I decided to try the Pumpkin Bread with Butter Rum Sauce and Cream Cheese Ice Cream.  The cake was light and tasty and the ice cream and sauce were excellent."
1,"Brunch = best in the burgh.  Hands down.  Best. eggs. ever. I am not even sure how the eggs can be that good.  I know what you are saying, \""They are eggs, Jessica.  Get a grip.\""  No.  I will not.  I cannot.  I want to stand on top of rooftops and shout my love for these eggs all over town.  \n\nJ, H and I went there a few Sundays ago.  We all got the same thing. When was the last time you went to a meal and all three people ordered the same thing.  It was that good.  The scallop breakfast is out of this world.  2 perfectly cooked scallops, scrambled eggs (the eggs!!!), the creamiest, tastiest grits in the world, buttery croissant and sausage, apples and butternut squash.  Don't think those things go together?  They do and are awesome!  J and I also both got orders of bacon cause no brunch is complete without bacon.  \n\nOur service was also great.  Nice hostess, awesome waiter.  All was perfect.  \n\nReally freaking good brunch.  Really.  Cannot say enough about those freaking eggs.  \n\nOh, but don't order an additional mimosa from the deal - they are $8 a piece which is a bit steep."
1,Oh I love this place.  It has a great menu and wine list.  It has all the great dishes with a touch of flare.  I took this meal to seafood town from start to finish and have no regrets.  The staff was really friendly - realized I was there for a special occasion and brought out a desert that said congratulations - the little things.\n\nWe dined outside and I felt tucked away in a Europe-esque atmosphere for a few hours.\n\nIt is worth reserving a spot on the patio to get the full experience.
1,Love Casbah.  Been going there for years and have never had a less than great meal and service.  OF course their signature lamb is to die for (with the Stag's Leap Petite Syrah).  What can I say -- the cheese plate is great.  Everything is well-prepared and the service is among the best in the -burgh.
1,"Casbah is fast becoming my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I have been there twice now and both times the service and food was impeccable. \n\nThe calamari and the proscuitto appetizer are a great start to the meal and not too heavy or filling and I could eat a whole basket of the warm bread. I'd love to know where they get it from as I can't imagine they bake it there, but maybe they do! \n\nThe pork chop is their signature dish and does not disappoint. My husband had the duck the last time we were there and it was juicy on the inside and had a great crispy skin. I had the red pepper casereccia and was thrilled with the amount of seafood in the dish. There were 4 HUGE, delicious scallops and a ton of lump crab. Very impressive. I was there with a group of 6 this time and everyone had clean plates at the end of the meal. \n\nI like the fact that it seems like the menu changes with the seasons. The proteins may stay static, but since they use a lot of local ingredients, the accompaniments/side dishes might be different every time you come. Honestly, this is one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. I plan on trying it for brunch or lunch sometime soon."
1,"My absolutely favorite dish is the potato gnocchi. Just amazing! Service is fantastic, nice decor. I wish they wouldn't use such huge paper towels in the bathroom, but other than that I really like this place."
1,"I recently realized that I had only given Casbah four stars after my first visit here for New Year's Eve 2012... What a terrible judgment call that was on my part. So I'm back to proclaim that over a year later - having dined here again in 2013 - with a year of dining experiences across the country -  I still regularly dream of this restaurant. Do I dare say it's my favorite restaurant? I'm not sure, but if it's not my favorite, it's certainly close.\n\nWe returned after NYE last year to celebrate my birthday in March, making sure to bring along the oh-so-coveted Big Burrito birthday coupon. I ordered the Orecchiette with Chicken, Cranberries, Goat Cheese & Sage Cream. Oh. My. Goodness. Don't order this if you're on a diet... but order this if you love delicious food and living life to the fullest. It was ridiculously creamy, and the cranberries packed the perfect fruity balance to the rich dish. My husband ordered the Double-Cut Pork Chop with Kale & Butternut Squash Risotto. While recently dining at a highly rated restaurant in NYC, he said, \""My double-cut pork chop at Casbah was better than this double-cut pork chop.\"" That's when I knew that I needed to update my review of Casbah.\n\nFinally, my delicious birthday dinner ended with the Dark Chocolate-Raspberry Bread Pudding. I love ordering bread pudding at restaurants, and I think this is the best of them all. I would confidently enter this dessert in a bread pudding competition, knowing that I would be walking away with the blue ribbon."
1,"I have a soft spot for this place -- probably because it is one of the first restaurants my fiance ever took me to, and he made a special night out of it. We've been back many times, for many occasions, and Casbah has never disappointed. Great wine, cocktails, food, service, and atmosphere. It can be a little more cramped on the inside, but it's never too loud. If you can sit outside, it feels nice and spacious. It's also very nice downstairs.\n\nThe valet parking is a huge plus in my book, especially in that area of Shadyside. The service is always prompt and never overbearing. \n\nThe last time we went, we had the sheep's milk gnudi and I'm pretty sure it was sent straight from heaven down on to our plate. I nearly fought my fiance for the last piece. He loves me so he let me have it. The swordfish was wonderful. The lamb is always great. The short rib ravioli melts in your mouth. I'd highly recommend any of those.\n\nThe dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding is worth unbuttoning your pants for...and if you like dessert wines, you'll be in heaven for sure!"
1,"Best \""Babaganoush\"" we've had since we visited Egypt.\nThe gaspacho soup was fantastic, and since my husband wouldn't share his short rib ravioli, I can only assume they were suburb also. \nThe atmosphere was a tad basic, but it was also different and therefore interesting and enjoyable."
1,"The food here was absolute perfection; each bite was perfectly orchestrated to deliver optimal flavor and enjoyment. The service was also fantastic!\n\nFor my entree, I had the cioppino -- it may be one of the best that I've ever had. The bowl was filled with beautiful looking seafood: large shrimp, clams in their shells, mussels in their shells, a gorgeous piece of perfectly seasoned halibut, and enormous wonderfully cooked scallops. They knew how to cook each piece of seafood to showcase it well. And the charred sourdough served with the cioppino was the perfect complement to soak up all of the delicious, savory flavors of the broth without becoming a soggy mush! My grandfather had the halibut and loved it... Cleaned the plate!\n\nI had heard rave reviews of the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding, so we had to share one for dessert! My grandfather said it was incomparable to any bread pudding; it was a sweet, smooth, decadent indulgence that paired well with the house coffee.\n\nAnd the complementary salted caramels presented with the check were also amazing! I definitely need to come back again to try more of the menu... I think only wonderful items could possibly come out of that kitchen!"
1,"I took my boyfriend to Casbah at the end of September for his birthday. We were seated near the door for our reservation however it was a very warm night so it was nice to sit in an open air setting. Our server, her name has slipped my mind, was excellent. I am not a fan of red wines but my boyfriend is and it being his birthday, of course I said let's get a bottle of red. We explained to our server what white varietals I enjoy and she suggested a bottle (which has also slipped my mind being months ago that we were there)that was perfect-both of us enjoyed it. We started off with the papardelle. The rabbit was delicious and it was perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked-the flavors were amazing together! For entrees, my boyfriend ordered the duck and I ordered the short rib ravioli. His words to describe the duck were \""life changing\"". I was only able to taste a small piece of his since he ate it so quickly, but I agree it was excellent. The short rib was so tender and juicy. I was concerned it would be overly salty and it was not. It was the best ravioli I have eaten hands down! For dessert, we ordered a cheese tasting. It was the perfect way to end our meal-with the cheese tasting and a glass of wine. I can't wait to go back to Casbah and sample some other items-I would have ordered the entire menu on our first visit if I could have!"
1,"This update is for Casbah's brunch.\n\nAlright, Casbah. You got me, you got me good. Dinner as I mentioned before was decent, but the brunch, amazing. Compared to dinner, brunch at Casbah is definitely the better meal and deal. I don't advocate playing favorites when it comes to siblings in the same family, but sometimes you can't help it. Brother Brunch gets the nod here.\n\nBrunch is basically a fixed set. For $28, you choose an adult beverage (or non-alcoholic), an appetizer, and an entree. They start you off with some pistachio scones, buttermilk biscuits, and cornbread. Perfect, I like to stretch before I get my grub on. For my Prix-Fixe (fixed set), I went with the mimosa, smoked salmon, and sea scallop fry. \n\nSMOKED SALMON: If you like smoked salmon, then you would enjoy this appetizer. It's what you would expect but also a larger size than I thought it would be! \""Oh no, there's too much of something I like,\"" said nobody ever. Upon seeing the smoked salmon display fanned out on its plate with bits of egg, red onion, and aioli garnished over top, my salivary glands couldn't control themselves! \n\nSEA SCALLOP FRY: You know I love me some scallops. The dish came with two scallops, a small croissant, small bits of fennel sausage, a side of white corn grits, and a little bit of butternut squash and caramelized onions. I was tempted to go with the classic eggs/toast/waffle as an entree, but I am so glad I put on my big boy foodie stretchy pants and took a chance. It's not your typical brunch dish and it's one I would definitely recommend. \n\nAll in all, fantastic brunch experience. Definitely felt comfortably full, but not in a self-hatred, \""I-regret-this-decision-immediately\"" kind of way. Service was professional; our waitress kept the waters filled and came in to check on us a little after each dish was served."
1,"Let me say that my five stars are based primarily on the calamari appetizer ... it is SOOO good! The squid was very lightly battered and fried so briefly that it was tender and delicious. Seriously, it was one of the best I've eaten, and I've made it a point of sampling calamari. The entrees (short rib ravioli and cavatelli) were very good, too. As for the Carrot Cob for dessert, forget it. It only detracts from the otherwise wonderful meal."
1,"Upon receipt of the much-coveted Big Burrito birthday voucher, I had to make the tough decision about which of their restaurants to visit.  I was torn between Casbah and Eleven, but upon perusing the menus, reading reviews, and giving the matter much thought, I settled on Casbah.  I knew I'd made a good decision when I invited some friends to join me, and they said that, based on their past experience, I'd made an excellent choice!\n\nOur meal started off with a few slices of bread, which came with butter and a Greek yogurt spread.  The butter was good, but the yogurt spread was amazing, and both of them dressed up the bread very well.  We then ordered an appetizer of the bruschetta, which was not your normal bruschetta, but was delicious.  I'm not entirely sure of the ingredients, since what we received doesn't match the menu description posted on the website, but one notable thing about it was that it had some pomegranate seeds that gave it a subtle sweetness and juiciness, complementing the other savory ingredients.  For my entree, I ordered the orecchiette, a dish consisting of ear-shaped pasta tossed in a goat cheese and sage cream sauce, with chicken and dried cranberries.  Flavorwise, this was one of the most well-balanced dishes I've ever eaten, with the savory ingredients and sweet hints from the cranberries (which were actual cranberries, rather than craisins, as I'd imagined) melding together in perfect culinary harmony.  The pasta was also cooked to a perfect al dente firmness, which held up well in the microwave several days later when I ate the leftovers.  The cranberry-lime dry soda that I ordered to go with this entree complemented it very nicely, and was a great alternative to wine (while I was tempted, I didn't order any since my dining companions decided not to, due to having driven).\n\nMy two dining companions ordered the Scottish salmon and the gnocchi, respectively.  Based on the samples that they provided me, Casbah did a great job on these dishes, as well!  The salmon had a subtle saltiness that complemented the flavor nicely, without overpowering it.  My friend who ordered it had had it before at Casbah, but had since been to Scotland, and he said that it was very similar in quality and taste to the versions of this dish that he'd tried there.  The gnocchi was one of the most unique and varied dishes I've encountered, and, based on the two bites that I tried, brought the ingredients together in a medley of flavors and textures.  I think my friend who ordered it described it best by saying that every bite was a bit different, but that they were all delicious!  Although all of us tried bites of each other's dishes, we each liked our own choice best, so we chose well.\n\nAfter our entrees, we decided to order dessert.  Although I was tempted by the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding, since many reviewers speak highly of it, I decided to follow my instinct and get the chocolate-hazelnut bomba.  I'm so glad that I did, since this dessert was amazing!  If you like dark chocolatey, torte-like desserts or Nutella, this dessert is a must-try. Since I mentioned I was at Casbah for a birthday dinner, the dessert was served with \""Happy birthday\"" written on the plate in chocolate icing, which was a nice touch.  My dining partners ordered the creme brulee to split between themselves, which came topped with an apple compote.  Based on the bite that I tried, it was a good rendition of a brulee, but couldn't match the star power of the chocolate bomba.\n\nWe visited at 7:30pm last Sun., at the later end of their serving hours, but service from our waiter, Brian, was very good.  We were seated in the tent-like area in the front of the restaurant, which stayed surprisingly warm during most of our visit.  At one point before dessert, upon returning from the restroom, I noticed that it'd cooled off, but the manager came out to turn on the heating elements, and it warmed back up in less than 10 min.\n\nIn sum, if you're looking for a solid fine dining experience with innovative, delicious food, Casbah is a great choice.  The food was impressive in its quality, and the service was what I've come to expect at a higher-end restaurant.  I'd particularly recommend getting on the Big Burrito mailing list to receive a $30 birthday voucher and $10 off coupons for the holidays, and taking advantage of one of these occasions to try it.  I'm certain that you'll be as pleased with your experience there as me and my dining partners!"

1,"I used to live about four blocks from the Quiet Storm, and for a period breakfast here was an every day affair.  Those two facts have nothing to do with each other--the period in question was close to the end of the first semester of my (super-)senior year, when my friends and I would stay in our studios all night working, haul ass out to Quiet Storm for ambrosia-caliber restorative tofu scramble and coffee, and go back to school bright-eyed and bushy-tailed for another day of class.  And then usually I'd take a three-hour nap after the first class.  But I'm sorry, what is it I'm reviewing here?\n\nThe Quiet Storm has absolutely the best tofu scramble I've ever had.  I'm an accomplished vegan eater (I get stuff in my mouth first try nine times out of ten), I've had the best scrambles New York and San Francisco have to offer.  Believe you me, Quiet Storm tops them all.  I wish I knew their secret recipe, but the part I do know--baking the tofu rather than just sauteeing it--makes a tremendous difference.  Come in on a lazy Sunday morning, get the Nothin' Fancy, and you will see for yourself just how good tofu can be.  On top of that, they are as vegan-friendly as can be, with earth balance for the toast; soy, rice, and almond milks; and a selection of specifically vegan mixed drinks and milkshakes.  Plus, sandwiches!  Get the spicy spinach and peanut butter wrap, ask for added tofu (planks not crumble), and be astonished yet again.\n\nAND AND, as a delicious cherry on top, they have theme brunches, fantastic theme brunches that show off the creativity and chops of the cooks here in a way that the regular menu can only hint at.  Check out their website and see when the next theme brunch is, and make a point of going.  Get there early."
1,"CASH ONLY!!!  What a pleasant surprise!  I went here for the first time last night and wasn't sure what to expect when i walked in.  The place seems to have some spacial issues.  There was a bar but they don't serve alcohol, more of a coffee/diner bar.  The tables and chairs seem odd and it took me a while to find a chair that was comfortable, but maybe this is by design.  I am not a coffee expert but i really enjoyed my several cups of decaf.  Anyhoo, to the food.  This place is vegetarian only.   I started with a Hummus plate, unlike most creamy hummuses this hummus was gritty as i could actually taste the chick peas with each bite.  The hummus was surrounded by fresh crisp cucumbers, carrots, celery, calamata olives (big fan) and pita. Perfect starter.  For my main entree i ordered the curry special.  Do not expect an Indian food experience but this will not disappoint.   Everything was in the bowl, chick peas, basmanti rice, carrots, and other miscellaneous items.  Once i started dipping my pita into it I could not stop.  It was savory, spicy and just the perfect compliment to the cold snowy night.    This is one storm i will enjoy braving from time to time."
1,"After three trips to Quiet Storm I am hooked.   I had the Bahn Mi, then the Veggie Gyro, then a burrito.  All were a large portion with excellent fresh ingredients at a price that was really really great.  \n\nMy significant other is addicted to the chili, which actually has a good heat level.  \n\nAlso the milkshakes are to die for.  Can't get enough of them.\n\nService is prompt and attentive.  The waitstaff is knowledgeable and friendly.  Service is quick even when they are busy.  This is the perfect casual restaurant.  The decor is funky  and cool.  There is even a pinball machine!\n\nWill return again and again I am sure."
1,"My husband and I stopped going here, back in 2010, because of the bad service we were receiving. We used to call the servers \""Whole Foods Rejects\""; they were always cranky and we felt not welcomed, rushed. At the end of 2011, I think they got a new manager, the service has been optimal and we haven't stopped going since. Their food is delicious as well as their drinks and coffee."
1,"Nothing matches in this place! The tables, the chairs, the tiles and that's how we like it! Lots of delicious vegan items. Definitely a good place to try new things. Good coffee too!"
1,"I love quiet storm! I think it's as good as you can get for vegan cuisine. The country burrito is BOMB! So good, there has to be crack in the gravy. I also enjoy the tahini queso, I often add it to my burrito. It's best on the nachos. For around $13 you can get a delicious filling breakfast/brunch coffee/tea included. They also have great pastries & dairy free coffee drinks & milkshakes! It's a vegan dream come true. It does get a little crowded during Saturday mornings so expect a wait, but completely worth it. The atmosphere is oozing with hipster ambiance associated with the area (Garfield) which also means they often play good music! Last time I was there it was all Neil Young! Accompanied my burrito perfectly! I definitely recommend this place to vegans & NON-vegans alike!"
1,"I was somewhat worried about going here since the reviews seem to be bimodal, so I was pleasantly surprised when our food was flavorful (some reviewers complained of blandness) and not trying to imitate meat (some reviewers said that seemed to be the goal), but exploiting the wonderfulness of vegetables and scrambled tofu (which, despite the other complaints, was just fine). We had the \""tenders\"" appetizer, with both the vegan BBQ sauce and the vegan wasabi mayonnaise. We much preferred the BBQ sauce, but I am guessing if you are a wasabi fan, you would like that too. We all thought it was wonderful. On the advice of the server, I had the peanut wrap. It was spicy, heavily peanut-flavored, but full of yummy veggies. I also had a side of chili, that I liked a lot (and I make my own veggie chili at home, so I am picky). Ben had the apple panini with the gazpacho side. We both thought the gazpacho was kind of plain (it got better by adding chili!), but the apple panini (with \""seisage\"", cheese, etc.) was very good. Finally, Panchu had the coconut burrito, which was huge, but he ate the whole thing, and was very happy. We all split a vegan cinnamon roll for dessert, and I really wish I had been able to get my own!\n\nSome complained about the wait; I think this place fits well with the \""slow food movement.\"" If you want fast food, go to McDonald's.\n\nSo, based on one observation, I gave it five stars. YMMV."
1,"Quiet Storm is a delicious and cozy little place located in the colorful Bloomfield area. The buildings surrounding Quiet Storm are often painted with cute art or have little interesting things about them. I love this neighborhood, but I love Quiet Storm even more! \n\nI've only been here twice, and I always want to go more often but somehow it doesn't happen. I've turned on three of my friends to Quiet Storm too, and they love it just as much. The first time I visited I ordered a tofu hash. It was an amazing blend of seasonal vegetables, including some I would never eat otherwise. The tofu was nice and firm, the seisage was spicy and perfectly chewy. The vegan \""cheese\"" sauce was also rich and delicious.  The portion was so huge, I couldn't finish it. Leftovers are rarely as good as when the meal is fresh, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that my leftovers were even BETTER than the fresh meal. I think this is because the spices and vegetables had more time to meld together in a perfect veggie harmony. \n\nThe second time I visited was 4/21/2013. A group of my friends came here for Brunch. Two of us ordered the Vegan Country Burrito, another friend ordered the french toast with pistachio honey topping and my other friend ordered a tofu hash with black beans and salsa. Everything was generously portioned, but some meal choices were sold out. They were a bit disappointed that there was no more falafel. All of us devoured our plates and happily chattered about the complexity of flavor, protein content in vegan food items and how much we loved the atmosphere. \n\nQuiet Storm is a great little place to visit. It's never lacking in interesting things to look at while you eat. Food comes as quickly as possible. There are plenty of options to please everyone, and if you think you don't like vegetables, try one of their plates and you may change your mind. (Seriously, I am one of those vegans who hates veggies, but Quiet Storm food can get me to finish all of mine) \n\nTip: If you want to go for Sunday brunch, go early so your favorites will still be available. \n\nYou may also want to nudge the servers a little more than you usually would, because even though our drinks were bottomless, it was a pain to get them back to give us refills - even for water."
1,"My favorite for Pt. Breeze/Pittsburgh East End. Flat New York style, not greasy, timely delivery, they know my orders!"
1,"Great pizza, reasonable prices, fast service - cant ask for much more!"
1,"This Valentines Day I ordered a pizza for my boyfriend and asked that they make a heart on it out of green peppers. The pizza was great, the heart was perfect, and he loved it!"
1,"By far my favorite Pizza place in the east end.  The buffalo chicken pizza here is fantastic, and very unique.  I haven't been able to find anything even remotely approaches it in other cities.  \n\nThe place is a bit pricey, but I feel its worth it.  My go to pizza delivery place!"
1,"I moved to PGH about 3 years ago with my cat and was nervous about finding a new vet. My previous vet in NY was just wonderful and I was doubtful that I would find another as good or as caring as her. Over the past 3 years I have taken my cat there not only for his yearly's but for other heatlth issues and was alway met with caring staff. Dr. Simard is my favorite vet there, and I try to get her as often as I can, but I have also seen Dr. Berger who is great and have heard good things about Dr. Schroth as well. Dr. Gerson is the owner, I have seen him once and he is a tad gruff, but if you are direct with him he is easy to work with. \nMy cat has always had a bit of a weight issue and since going to Point Breeze and working with Dr. Simard my cat has gone from 25 lbs to 18lbs and we seem to be well on the way to Dr. Simards goal of 16lbs. \nMy cat was also treated by Dr. Simard for a bad case of worms, after apparently catching and consuming a mouse in our basement - again they got me in right away and before I knew it he was worm-free. \nI have never felt like they wanted to up-sell me on anything, and they have always been very patient and willing to hear my concerns. \nI really love this clinic, and truely believe that they exceed in animal care."
1,"I took my cat here for a preliminary checkup after adopting her from the animal shelter & then again to have her declawed. I was very impressed by the facilities and service. The facilities are spotless & modern, and the vets seem both knowledgeable and willing to spend time with you and your animal.\n\nI was particularly impressed when I had my cat declawed. They kept her for several days to monitor my progress & called me each day to update me on her progress.\n\nIt seems a bit expensive (although I have no other point of comparison) but the service is well worth it."
1,"There is nothing better than a neighborhood market, and Frick Park Market fits the bill. Come here for grocery staples, a great homemade sandwich (get the breakfast sandwich, any of them!), or just to hang out. The owner will be there & is happy to talk to you.\n\nThe best part about the market, though, is when the kids get off school & come into the store for candy & soda. You can tell that the business is connected to the neighborhood and that everyone gets along. Pittsburgh treasure!"
1,anything you need you can find it at the market :)
1,"There is nothing like this in chicago!  (that I know of).....I hope I get to stay in Pittsburgh long enough just to take advantage of this co-op.  I love the bulk section, especially since I can choose the quantity of what I want to buy.  Super convenient for travelers.  You can buy pasta, granolla, flour, quinoa, cous cous, cane sugar, spices, YERBA MATE!!!, dried fruit, nuts, olive oil, peanut & almond butter, soap.....man, I could go on & on.  You can buy all of that stuff & choose how much you want of it.  \n\nI was suprised that they had cacao powder, for such a small place.  They have a nice little section of tofu, tempeh, & seitan next to a bunch of vegan cheese that looked really good.  \n\nThey also have a juice bar & vegetarian \""cafe.\""  I don't think I'd call it a cafe, more like buffet.  I wasn't all that impressed with the food they had cooked, but I'm not going to penalize them for that.  For such a small place it's pretty amazing what they already have going on there.  I really want to try something from their juice bar too!!  \n\nThere must be someone dj'ing the music in the store because I heard some great music that you wouldn't hear on the radio.  Everyone was very curteous and nice.  I should try to make friends with these people since I'm new in town."
1,"I just found this place a month back and I'm kind of blown away by how awesome it is. Fresh produce, awesome prepared salads and dips, bulk everything, natural cleaners, and plenty of hippie garbage you can't help but fill your shelves with. The best part is that they try to stock up with locally sourced produce, milk, and meat. And you can get a good discount if you purchase stock in the co-op."
1,"I was visiting Pittsburgh and looking for a throat spray called Singers Saving Grace. Whole Foods didn't have the item in stock but East End Co-Op did! Also, had a smoothie while a shopped. \n\nWhat a great find!"
1,"Forget Whole Foods when you have East End Cooperative! Honestly, this is quite possibly one of my favorite coops. They make some amazing deli items...so amazing that I went back twice during my visit to PA. I was only expecting to have a few options in the prepared food section, but the vegan options were plentiful. Their mock tuna salad was impressive, made with tvp, vegenaise, and spices. The potato salad was creamy and exceptionally delicious. And the vegan pasta salad was also impressive. Generally most grocers fail in this department, but East End excels by leaps and bounds. I can't believe how tasty their store-made food was. The prices were also very reasonable, if not low. If I lived in PA, I'd join their coop and would go there frequently."

1,"I love this place!  You never know what your going to find!  They have all kinds of things, that are usually slavaged from a home or business.   Kitchen cabinets, tables, mantels, windows, doors, tons of doors!   If your some one who likes to fix old things or make new things out of old stuff, you must go here!  I picked up an old dresser today for $10 its needs the drawer fixed and to be refinished, but when its done its going to look beautiful!  They have old appliances , bathroom sinks and toilets, lighting fixtures, wood, paint, counter tops, flooring materials, some tile, etc., etc.!"
1,"Some helpful hints for the Climbing Wall:\n\n-A one-day pass is $12.  College students/active military pay $10.  Wednesday is 1/2 price for ladies (but only after they pay full price on the first visit).  Wednesday is also 1/2 price for guys who wear a sports bra.  Yup, you heard me right.  Wednesdays are usually pretty crowded.\n\n-They run a different membership special every month.  If you climb more than once a week, a membership can definitely be worth it.\n\n-If it's your first time at the wall, I highly suggest just doing the \""bouldering certification\"" instead of the \""safety and belay certification class.\""  The bouldering certification takes about 5 minutes and then you can start climbing.  Decide if you like it, then do the belay certification.\n\n-If you \""like\"" them on facebook, you can get updates about when they change the routes, what membership specials they're running, if they're selling any old/used shoes for discounted prices, etc.  \n\nThe wall is in a great location, on several bus routes, and right next to the East End Food Co-op.  It can get crowded, but everyone takes turns so you have plenty of opportunities."
1,"Went to this place on a Groupon and fell in love. It reminds me of the days when I lived in Denver. I miss it! The routes are decently hard and allow me to push myself to get better. Staff has always been awesome. People there help give pointers. It does get pretty crowded sometimes, especially on Friday nights. I'd say they are almost in need of an expansion! Keep up the good work, Climbing Wall. I'll be seeing you a lot for the next year :)"
1,"I've been climbing for a few years but have friends who have never climbed. This place has lots of climbs at all different levels so my friends and I can enjoy climbing here together.  Plus they have instructional classes if you want to learn more. It has a great atmosphere - a great place to hang out with friends or meet new people. The staff are amazing! Very nice and very helpful. The prices are very reasonable, lower than any other gym I have climbed in (and I have climbed in lots of facilities). I definitely recommend climbing here."
1,"OK, so I admit that I was underwhelmed by Cafe Zinho when I first went, a few years ago.  And then I didn't go for a long time.  A few months back, my husband and I randomly decided to give it another try, and boy am I glad we did!  It's fantastic, and has quickly become part of our regular line up.\n\nI'll say again that I'm not certain how the food is Portuguese.  That being said, it is mighty delicious.  I love the personal service.  I love the corn bread.  The starters are phenomenal, to the point where I sometimes think that the entrees are superfluous.  But when we get them, they are lovely too.  I love the ambiance.  In short, I owe Cafe Zinho an apology."
1,"Visiting from NY, we actually found this highly-rated restaurant on Yelp ... and we were certainly not disappointed! It's situated on a nice residential block near a large liquor store (byob).  The ambiance is fantastic and the staff are warm, friendly and attentive. We were seated in the private back room because no other tables were available. A real VIP treatment.  \nFor starters, the goat cheese pastry and smoked salmon appetizers were to die for. Many of the others sounded great too.  Our daughter, who is at college here, was missing some of the food options of NY. Not any more. She had the lamb burger with feta cheese. I had the seafood stew and my wife had Chilean sea bass.  All fantastic! Thankfully we had just enough room for tres leches dessert. If anyone knows of a Portuguese restaurant this good in NYC ... or even in Newark Ironbound I'd love to hear about it.  We will definitely be back!"
1,"What a gem of a place in Shadyside.  It s places like this that makes me miss living there.  Food was outstanding!  Because it was our first time, we wanted to do a little bit of this and that.  2 appetizers, Becky s salad and the special of the eve:  smoked salmon on crostini with creme fresh, a clam dish, forgot name, with the best tomatoe-white wine, I could have drunk from the bowl, broth; Becky s salad (the lemon dressing was out of this world delicious--again, could have drunk it, good).  I m usually not fan of walnut in my salad, but the crumbled goat cheese made me forget about my dislike of it, that I ate it happily.  Good pairing.  The special of the night, we opted for sharing the lamb shank with reduced red wine sauce and simple veggies.  Small veggie selection by american standards--half russet potato, slither of zucchini, and a stem of green onion, but the star afterall was the lamb, and it was meduim perfect, just as I ordered!  \n\""Would you care for some dessert?\"", Ramon, our waiter (he was fabulous!) asked.  And so round 3 begins.  Coffee, a chocolate mousse with whip cream, beauty and...  their version of creme brulee.  I thought it had a hint of peanut butter, but not sure.  Regardless it was  so, so divine.\nThis place was busy but we did not feel rushed, unlike most places.  The service was great, the atmoshphere quaint; it s definitely a neighbourhood cafe-- alot of repeat clientele, from what I gathered.  We shall return.\nFinally, on an end note. Cafe Zinho is BYOB, so bring your favourite bottle or magnum of vino.  And they only take cash or personal check, but they do have an ATM."
1,"I was here on Mother's Day with my Mom, my mother-in-law, my aunt, and my cousin.  This was a \""girl's day out\"", a gift to ourselves (we left the menfolk at home!).  Afternoon Tea was absolutely exquisite.  Don't get me wrong--I love a good ballgame and hotdog just like everyone else.  But sometimes I gotta do \""chick stuff\"" like this too!  \n\nWe took the tour of the mansion and the Frick Art Museum.  Current exhibits include The Road to Impressionism: Barbizon Landscapes from the Walters Art Museum and 1806, Jena, a significant late-nineteenth-century painting by French artist Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier.  \n\nThere is a lot to see and do at the Frick.  Get off your butts Pittsburghers and enjoy this place!"
1,"What a Frick-ing fantastic place!\n\nThe Frick Art & Historical Center has all the bases covered when it comes to museums: historical site, visual art, beautiful grounds, classic cars and buggies, restaurant, greenhouse.  Not to mention that everything -- with the exception of the house tour -- is free.  No one could possibly say there's *nothing* that here interests him here.  Husband certainly couldn't convince me.\n\nI kid.  He's a trooper.\n\nWe arrived at the Frick on a gorgeous blue morning and started out with an excellent tour of the Frick family abode.  When the family moved to New York City after Henry Clay struck it rich in the steel business, they kept their house in Pittsburgh for return visits to the city; 93% of what's in the house is original to the Frick family, which always makes a house tour more interesting to me.  They lived lavishly, and Frick was an avid art collector.  His personal collection -- displayed both in the home and museum -- is impressive.\n\nAfter our tour we visited the Car and Carriage Museum, which had husband transfixed with its Model T Touring Car, Rolls Royce Silver Ghost, American Bantam Convertible Coupe, Panhard et Levassor Tonneau and Lincoln Model K Sport Phaeton among others.  Finally, we finished up with a spin around the Art Museum itself.  It's a beautiful building with a very manageable size.  I was thrilled to find a current exhibition of Medieval Persian pottery -- found along the ancient Silk Road route -- currently running as well.\n\nSay what you will about H. C. Frick (let's be real: the Johnstown Flood and handling of the Homestead Strike would have tarnished Mother Teresa's image), the Museum and Historical Site are *well* worth your time."
1,"How have I been living in Pittsburgh for over a year without a visit to this awesome site?!  My husband and I finally paid a visit to the Frick thanks to the \""We Love Our Members\"" promotion that local museums were offering to their members.  (We are members at the Carnegie).  I was vaguely familiar with who Frick was and knew there was a house tour, but I had no idea how much this site had to offer.  \n\nOur visit began with a trip into the shop/visitor's center.  There we browsed the gift shop while waiting for the tour to begin.  The gift shop building was once a playhouse for the children and you can still see where gutters for the bowling alley run through the middle of the floor.  It was a great place to start the tour and begin learning about the family and their connection to the area and American industry.  I am not a Pittsburgh native, so I knew very little about them.  It is important to note that you can't bring large bags with you on the tour, but they do provide free lockers to store them while you are in the house.\n\nThe tour continued by entering the house.  The enclosed porch provides a coat rack so you don't have to lug it around with you.  The house is detailed as if the Frick family was still living there.  We learned from our docent that they were fortunate that one of the family members lived there through the 1980s, so the house was well maintained and preserved.  Each room has exquisite detail and decor.  Our guide spent a great deal of time explaining and showcasing the art work.  Many local Pittsburgh artists were featured along with well known artists such as Monet.  Every aspect of the rooms were detailed including showcasing the new development at the time, aluminum.  The rooms upstairs featured less detail but were still interesting.  \n\nAfter our visit to the house, we stopped in the green house.  I'm not that in to plants, but it was interesting to learn that the plants grown there are used in the cafe.\n\nSpeaking of the cafe, we stopped in just to check it out.  They were fully booked that day (which is fine since we weren't planning on eating anyway) but we were so enticed by the dessert selections that we got two desserts to go.  A nutella cheese cake and a baked apple.  We enjoyed those later that evening after dinner.\n\nI am not that in to cars, but the car and carriage museum was very interesting.  The first section is carriages that the Frick family used.  My favorite was their \""special occasion\"" carriage that even had  foot warmer!  The car area featured various automobiles that had a connection to Pittsburgh.  There is also the option of watching three short videos about automobiles in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe art museum alone is worth a visit.  They were preparing for an exhibit when we were there so only the Italian and French sections were open, but they were fantastic.  A great collection with amazing detail and descriptions of each of the paintings.  The interior of the building is an attraction itself.  It does not look like it was built in the 1960s with the fantastic marble and woodwork.\n\nOverall, a very enjoyable place to visit that I highly recommend to anyone because there really is something for everyone at Frick."
1,An often overlooked gem in the heart of Pittsburghs most beautiful neighborhood.\n\nThe Frick is essentially 5 small sights in one. \n\nThe grounds.  Nice 5 acre area that is well maintained giving a park like atmosphere.\n\nThe greenhouse. Lovely little greenhouse you can walk through.\n\nThe car museum is neat but currently closed for 18 months.  An early electric and steam car are the highlights.  Lots of olds rolls royces.\n\nThe cafe. Food.\n\nThe Clayton house.  12 dollar tour worth every penny.  The house tour takes about one hour and really is fascinating.  Not a huge mansion.\n\n\nAll in all just a nice place.
1,The best place for an artic swirl. :)
1,"Hubby and I have taken to driving up Carson street to get to the Southside in order to avoid that HORRENDOUS traffic in Squirrel Hill.  We drove by Page Dairy Mart a few times and each time he would casually mention that he would like to go there someday.\n\nWell, we did.\n\nI wish I could comment on one of the DELICIOUS looking Sundaes, but I'm watching what I eat soooo... frozen yogurt it was.\n\nWhat I can say is that the yogurt was smooth and creamy and I LOVE that they have a ton of flavors they can \""mix into\"" the yogurt so you can get almost any flavor you want.  Hubby had a cone of regular soft serve ice cream and said it was really yummy.  He also had an order of cheese sticks and said they were just o.k., so we will probably stick to ice cream/frozen yogurt from this place.\n\nThe kids working were fast and friendly so we left them a nice tip.  As someone who worked her way through college working at a frozen yogurt shop I can say -- TIP YOUR SERVERS, even if just your change -- they will greatly appreciate it.  :-)"
1,"Stopped in here after a bit of night time sightseeing of Pittsburgh. My sister and brother-in-law, who are the ones who live in Pitt, had never been here before, so we were all newbies! Huge plus that it's open until 11pm on weekdays. This little place is great. You walk up to the order window, pick from a handful of different soft serve favors and cone choices, and are given your fresh ice cream in no time! I ordered the strawberry soft serve in a waffle cone. HUGE portion, and less than $3! Obviously shocking to me as a native New Yorker, since nothing around here is ever that cheap. My sister had cheesecake soft serve, my other sister had blueberry soft serve, both also in waffle cones. My brother-in-law had key lime soft serve in a pretzel cone! So unique and actually really delicious, having that savory/sweet thing going on. 4 cones of ice cream for less than $12. Fresh, homemade ice cream, with really nice staff. I look forward to my next visit to pittsburgh, so I can enjoy this place again!"
1,Great ice-cream at a reasonable price. I love their chocolate banana milkshake.
1,Get a Southside Shake with hot fudge shake and peanut butter sundae on top - absolutely amazing!
1,"This place is a little gem! Hidden just down E Carson, past all the shops and busy streets there is a tiny little unassuming building on a large corner lot. I've never been a fan of soft serve or gone out of my way for it, but this place will make you do just that. Not to mention the fresh squeezed lemonade made to order (yes, they squeeze the lemons right into your cup.) Burgers and fries are also made to order, so be prepared for a short wait while you prepare mentally for the heaven you're about to consume. I'm not a fan of their fries (they tasted like they were made in old grease) but wow that cheeseburger. I have a small appetite and can't usually finish most things - so when I ordered my burger and fries I let the bf know he was expected to finish it for me. Little did we know he wouldn't get any of that delicious burger, because the second I took the first bite the rest magically disappeared. \n\nOh! They also have old fashioned dip cones which are one of my favs. \n\nDefinitely recommended."
1,I have had lots of items off of their large menu and everything has been good.
1,"I've been coming to page's since I was about 5, literally. I love it. It's a local favorite for sure and for many reasons. 1) the history behind page's... Literally if you walk behind page's there are old photos of what the building used to look like and some south side history :P. 2) their ice cream is incredibleeee. They have a ton of unique flavors and combinations. My favorite item on the menu is their strawberry sundae with twist ice cream, with an Esther's chocolate covered pretzel on the side. Pure heaven. 3) their food is amazing as well. I love their south side hot dog! It's unique and amazing.. Toast bun, grilled dog and chilli sauce.. So good. Their fries are awesome as well. I also adore their lemonade, both regular and freckled. Keep in mind they are cash only though!"
1,"I gotta give my man Jonathan kudos for some recent changes he's implemented.  The upstairs now has a menu with smaller lighter items for the bar.  I can now finally go here and just grab an app' at the bar without having the customary food coma afterwards after his multicourse feast.  He's upgraded the staff and kept the pro's from the past (marney and errol).  Steve and Clint are good newer additions as server and bartender.  This is only my second 5 star review, probably should deserve 4.5, but wtf it's so obvious he cares and appreciates the business so much.  The food is still great, the patio is nice, the hood' location is still scary and fun and the smaller menu items and additional staff are appreciated.  I do wish he had more options than just italian wine, but last night we were able to find a great white.  The salmon carpaccio last night is the best I've ever had.  The mussels with diablo sauce was also excellent.  I  don't know of any other small restaurant chef in Pittsburgh that takes as much care in the quality of ingredients used (except for Douglas Dick at Bona Terra).  In my original post I said it was a bit pricey, but I've decided it's well worth the cost now.  I also tried a ceviche here that was out of this world.  There's definitely a lot more to have at this italian place than just pasta and red sauce."
1,"Some people train for marathons, other people train for this meal. Before sitting down make sure you get in the proper state of mind and prepare yourself for a long night of indulgence. This being my first dining experience at Alla Famiglia, I was unaware of the challenge that I had undertaken. We had A Party of Five, empty bellies and an optimistic mentality; we couldn't resist the tempting appetizers recited to us and ended up ordering the mega meatball, calamari and shrimp, and sausage over polenta. All were amazing. The meatball was the highlight: twelve ounces of perfectly cooked beef, filled with mozzarella and covered in sauce and provolone (kisses fingers). Big plus for including the tentacles in the calamari. I've noticed these legs less and less while dining out, when did they lose suction as a staple of a calamari appetizer? Also adorning our table were a few clothing options in which to dress the bread, all of them enjoyable on their own or as an ensemble.\n\nOne would think after such a hearty opener all that remained was the main course. How wrong of an assumption that turned out to be. Before we could even think about crushing our dinners, we had to face two formidable courses of salad and pasta. As mentioned by other reviewers, the salad is great. Nice dressing, nice fillers, nice roughage. The pasta that's included with the entree was a fusilli bucati in a vodka sauce served family style. Unable to pass up the promise of a great carbonara with guanciale and fresh egg, we had two pasta opponents to tackle. Both were cooked so perfectly al dente I would have put them on my NHL all-star ballot as a write-in if voting hadn't already closed.\n\nAt this point in the meal, I had completely forgotten that I still hadn't even seen my main course. And I was fine with that. As a table we compiled quite the culinary collection: bistecca fiorentina, veal milanese, veal marsala, mussels in a diavola sauce and the sea bass special for the evening. You know when a meal is so utterly divine that you just stop talking to everyone around you and have a one on one pow wow with the gastro-gods? Yeah, that's what happened. I will say at one point during the meal, my brother had to get up and take a walk around the restaurant for fear he would wake up two days later in the ICU if he didn't fight off the impending food coma that threatened his existence. Instead of napkins they should have given us a white towel and a trainer to throw it on the table for us because we were doing our best impression of Apollo Creed...and our food was Ivan Drago.\n\nOur waiter, who we thought was our friend, then had the nerve to ask if we wanted dessert, some balls on that guy. Of course we wanted dessert. We decided on the tiramisu which I hope had a clean bill of health because it blew our minds. It was so good that I was upset with myself. I did exactly what I hate seeing someone do on any and every food network show. I took a bite, put down my fork, closed my eyes and just said, \""wow!\"" I just hope it was as good for the tiramisu.\n\nOther housekeeping items: you can bring your own wine for which they charge a corking fee. All the water is bottled, but I didn't see it on the bill so I figure it's included. The chef/owner is extremely friendly and accessible, as he is cooking basically right next to your table. Parking at the meters next to the building is free after 6pm, despite what it says on the signs; our waiter informed us they have an unspoken agreement with the parking authority.\n\nHeavy on the belly, heavy on the wallet, heavy in our hearts!"
1,Always fantastic.
1,Incredible Italian food. Mushroom appetizer is just phenomenal. So is the mozzarella cheese. Great fish. Expensive but worth it!
1,"Might be the best restaurant I have been to in Pittsburgh! Made reservations on a Friday evening at 9:00PM for two.\n\nApps: The service was great, the server knew all menu items in detail by heart. We started with 2 appetizers my fiance wanted the Calamari and Shrimp that was in a garlic, herb lemon sauce...best shrimp I have ever had, they were colossal! I ordered the Meatball stuffed with bufala mozzarella smothered in a plum tomato sauce, it was unbelievable! \nThe salads course was great and I'm not a salad guy. We were both almost full at this point and we still had the pasta and entree course ahead.\n\nThe Pasta Course: The owner wheels out a cart to our table with a whole wheel of Locatelli Pecorino Romano, in which he will use to make our Cacio e Pepe, table side. He pours 2 portions of linguini on top of the cheese wheel, adding the heavy cream, EVOO and pepper, he mixes and digs into the top layer of the cheese wheel and serves it into our bowls.\n\nEntrees: I ordered the Veal Chop Milanese, I was so full at this point I took 2 bites out of my Veal and couldn't go anymore, but this was the best veal chop I have ever had, had to take the rest home. My Fianc\u00e9, she ordered the Chilean Sea Bass, but was equally as full, the fish was perfectly prepared and melted in your mouth, she took all, but 2 bites home also. Unbelievable experience!!"
1,Fabulous!
1,"good food, we had the bean appetizer, seafood diablo, and the flounder...It is expensive but well worth the money, classic."
1,"Incredibly authentic Italian cuisine. If your looking for a memorable spot with some of the most delicious actually Italian dishes then look no further than Alla Famiglia. This is a restaurant to celebrate an occasion at such as New Years, Valentines Day, Anniversaries,etc. \nmy girlfriend and I came here for New Year's Eve and we could not have enjoyed it more. To start we had the Alla Famiglia Meatball. I couldn't get over the rich tomato sauce that the meatball was surrounded in and the smoothness of the actual meat. Just delicious, must have.\nWhen you order an entree you also get their house salad served in a homemade Italian vinaigrette (light and complimenting to the diverse salad topped with great peppers!) and their Penne Alla Vodka. This pasta dish alone is enough to warrant a visit . I am a alla vodka lover and this is the best I've ever had. It's hard to describe but its not to rich or creamy it's absolutely just right. The pasta itself was so smooth and melted in your mouth with their sauce.\n\nFor entree my girlfriend had their Ahi Tuna Steak (special). Prepared perfectly and with a great lemon butter sauce. I had their speciality, their double cut Veal Chop. This is something straight out of The Flintstones in its portion but let me tell you it's with every penny. I had the Veal Chop Pizzoaloa style wivh was with hot & sweet peppers, a great tomato sauce covered in provolone cheese. This was such a moist Veal Chop that literally fell off the bone and with the marbling it just melted in your mouth. \nEverything was spectacular , it's a restaurant you have to visit if your in the area at least once given you are willing to spend for your meal. $$$$ but you absolutely get what you pay for."
1,Just recently returned. PHENOMENAL meal! Glenn our waiter was superb. Loved the veal dishes.  I also enjoyed the new cocktail menu. One of the drinks was iced coffee with orangicello and frangelica cream. DELICIOUS!
1,"UPDATED: Just wanted to share that we attempted to visit for a third time when my husband's brother was in town in mid-November of 2014.  We had reservations for 7:30 on a Tuesday, so we obviously figured we would be seated immediately.  The brother and his girlfriend arrived a couple minutes before the reservation and were told to go up to the bar while they set the table and wait for the rest of the party.  I arrived about a minute after and my husband a few minutes behind me as he needed to park due to the lack of valet during the week.  There was no one at the host stand when either of us came in.  So we went up to the bar, declined a drink... and waited, and waited.  The bartender soon became deeply involved in picking a wine for a couple at the bar, not his fault.  The brother eventually was able to flag down a waitress to ask if she could check on our table.  She looked very annoyed.  She eventually went over to the phone at the bar, called down, hung up the phone and said, dead pan, \""no, it's not ready yet.\""  Not a smile, not a sorry, not a \""can we get you a drink on the house?\"" Meanwhile, there was an open table for 4 on that floor.  The bartender eventually told us \""that's for a reservation.\"" \""Yes, we have a reservation... for 25 minutes ago.\""  \""They must have specifically requested that table.\""  They did, however, offer us the table right next to the door on the first floor though - the one with the 10 degree breeze coming in that night.  No thank you.  We were very insulted by the lack of table for our reservation, but more so by the lack of acceptable service.  We decided to leave and spend $20 on pizza instead of $100+ per person and enjoyed much better service.. which is never the way it should be.  Hopefully they solve this problem soon.  We'll give it one more go when the insult has worn off.\n\nMy husband won't hesitate to tell you what his favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh is: Alla Famiglia.  And to be honest, these days I agree with him!  \n\nWhile my husband enjoys many of the more \""up and coming\"" restaurants with smaller portions and interesting flavor combinations, he often finds himself longing for the same quality food with better cuts of meat and bigger portions.  This is where we satisfy both of our appetites for big flavor and, well, big portions.  But to reduce Alla Famiglia to those two things alone would not do it justice.\n\nLet's start out instead with addressing the two biggest critiques of this place: its location and the price.  Yes, it is in Allentown, but they also have plenty of parking and valet if you prefer.  Honestly, we drive almost everywhere to get dinner, so this is not an issue for us.  The other thing I always hear about is how expensive it is.  Some of those complaints come from people who I know have no problem giving their money to the big steakhouse chains, while getting a lot less value.  No, it is not cheap.  You will likely pay upwards of $50 for your entry.  The veal chops are close to $70.  But, that's not all you get.  You get delicious, fresh baked bread, a spread, dipping oil and gustoso for same, a delicious salad, and homemade pasta served family style.  If you wanted to be especially frugal, you could approach this place like an Olive Garden senior special: feast on the freebies and take your entree to go.  But, even if you're full, it may be too difficult not to savor the meal as it comes out...\n\nI've been here twice and my husband has been here three times (lucky - he got to go for work and he said they ordered almost every appetizer, all of which were apparently delicious).  The first time I ordered the filet with gorgonzola.  It was one of the most delicious and largest filets I've ever had.  My husband ordered a veal chop with prosciutto which I don't think I recognized on the current menu, but he absolutely loved it.  The veal chop is one of the largest bone-in cuts of meat I've seen and the sear on it was absolutely perfect.  We also ordered the mussels, which were spicy and delicious, and the meatball appetizer, which I remember being tasty, but nothing too out of the ordinary.  I think there are other things on the menu to try first. \n\nThe second time we came I ordered the Milanese veal chop, breaded, slightly citrusy, and absolutely heavenly.    He had the cowboy ribeye which was also large and an absolutely beautiful cut of meat.  The husband has a thing about fatty cuts and avoiding anything that is the least bit chewy, and he barely had to leave a piece on his plate.  We also got the calamari appetizer, which was perfectly, lightly fried with a savory, garlic sauce that sets it apart from the sweet sauces often served with calamari.\n\nFinally, I should note that the service we have received here has always been exceptional.  Everyone is always professional and courteous."
1,"Never thought I would be reviewing a bank, but that's the beauty of yelp! You can review so much more than just restaurants! \n\nI live fairly close to this bank and my parents use dollar bank, which is basically the reason I use them. I have been with this bank for about 8 years or so and have never had a problem with them! I love their free checking and I have a savings account with them as well. Their home equity is awesome too- fixed interest rate of 3.25%. \n\nThis particular branch has very helpful and friendly employees. They have a drive thru and it is always quick and easy. They will even give your dog a treat if they are in the car :). I've also never experienced long lines in this branch which is always nice!"
1,This is one of my favorite bars in Pittsburgh. They have  been getting a lot of bands to play. Especially font of the Wednesday night Blue Grass jam night. The hummus is great. The staff is exceptionally friendly and knows my name. They have a great beer selection too.
1,"Really great place to go. There was bluegrass music playing when I went which was a pleasant surprise. It wasn't too loud, so you could talk with others at your table. The food and service was great. Definitely want to come back here again"
1,"Crap!  I can't believe that I missed a \""First to Review\"" by just a matter of weeks.  Max's Allegheny Tavern has been a shining star and a \""must\"" for my Pittsburgh rotation of places to visit.  Years ago, when I worked on the Northside for Heinz, I spent many a rowdy Friday night here in the basement with factory workers.  \n\nWhat's there to say?  It's a Northside institution and always has a mixed crowd that is super cool and friendly.  The bartenders are friendly and manage to remember my name and drink choice even though I'm here only a few times a year.  My Friday nights here must have made quite an impression!  I love the decor here, dark wood paneling with lots of stained glass, and the downstairs bar is where the naughty people hang.  Jukebox and room for dancing.  The food is very homey and very reasonably priced.  The German nachos are always worth ordering, and they are smothered with Gouda cheese.  The spatzle is also a creamy indulgent treat.  And for those seeking the real Deutsch culinary experience, they have a large variety of sausages and schnitzels.  So it's a sausage factory in more ways than one."
1,"I like this restaurant so much I had my wedding rehearsal dinner here.  (Both the families liked the food very much.)  Max's is the best German food in Pittsburgh -- actually, it's the best German food I've had outside of Germany, and I've definitely had worse meals in Germany as well.\n\nMax's is in a restored hotel, and the decor is very much in the Victorian style of the original hotel building.  The exception is the bar area that's good for happy hour or watching a game, or just having a beer -- that has a lot of neon and a jukebox.  But the bar area is also tasteful and pleasant to be in.  Max's has a full bar, but their real specialty is their excellent selection of German beers, both in bottles and on tap.\n\nI haven't met a wurst I didn't like, and they're pretty much all offered here.  The Braunschweiger sandwich is pretty delicious and unique in my experience, and the schnitzels are very delicious as well.  Another specialty is the kase spatzle (Spatzle noodles with smoked Gouda cheese -- a twist on mac and cheese that ensures that even a picky child will have something to enjoy here), but my two favorite menu picks here are the hassenpfeffer and the spinach salad with warm bacon dressing.  For sides, the red cabbage salad is my favorite, although the sauerkraut is also very good.  I don't care for the German potato salad, however -- I like the kind that has caraway seeds and vinegar, and is served cold, but Max's offers the kind that has an unidentifiable sauce and is served warm.  Some people like that style of potato salad though, and from what I can tell, Max's does a decent rendition of it.\n\nIf you're looking to reserve a room here for a banquet, you have a lot of options.  The basement \""Rathskellar\"" is more bar-like in its atmosphere.  It would be a good place for some guys to have a birthday party or something.  For a rehearsal dinner or other formal event, one of the upstairs banquet rooms would be better.  Depending on the size of your group, you can arrange to have a buffet-style dinner, or individuals in the group can order directly off the regular dinner menu."
1,"Definitely my favorite German restaurant, this place brings back memories.... often a bit negative as it's right near the hospital... yes, my Mom took me there after my arm breaking fiasco, that time I got hit by the car, etc., etc. (I was obviously an uncoordinated child), but also wonderful as I could literally lose myself in their vast array of tasty foods.  It's definitely a North Side staple, and the atmosphere has a \""well worn\"" appeal with old pictures of the local Germanic community and of the area.  This place has it's own personality, which is a plus in my opinion!\n\nAs for the food... well, you can't find much better German food than this and at this price!  Both of my parents favor the peasant platter.  Me, I love the stuffed pretzel appetizer, all the different sausages (the weisswurst is amazing!), and their kasespatzle (thick, doughy egg noodles with butter and cheese).  I will always associate Max's with the best, most flavorful German food at an affordable price!"
1,"Not only does this place have a very nice atmosphere, the food is good (and cheap) too!\nFor under 10 dollars a person we each got:\n-A drink\n-A Bradtwurst sausage\n-2 giant potato pancakes, served with sourcream (note that these are NOT latkes)\n-A huge bowl of saurkraut, which also contained some pork and cranberries.\nDelicious home-baked bread, which was served with some saurkraut (prepared differently than the side) and apple-butter sauce.\n\nYUM!\n\nIt's hard not to like this place. I'm still having cravings for those pancakes :("
1,"A Pittsburgh tradition.  Try the Cheese stuffed pretzel appetizer, Count Esterhazy Schnitzel, and Apple Strudel (of course) for dessert.  Yum"
1,"I have been going to Max's for 20 years.  I love this place.  The Einlauf soup is just simple good eats, but if you're ever there when the soup special is beer cheese - ORDER IT!!.  I love their potato pancakes, sauerbraten and the basket of German rolls served with sauerkraut salad and apple butter.  The waitresses have been there for years, they are the best!  Most delicious long island iced tea in the city."
1,"This is my favorite restaurant on the Northside, possibly favorite restaurant in all of Pittsburgh.  I tell all my friends that this little restaurant is the best kept secret in Pittsburgh.  Max's is a quaint little German place that always has plenty of seating, even on Friday and Saturday nights.  The service is good.  The food is great, I always end up getting the potato pancakes.  If you are looking for a place to check out that isn't going to be as crowded and will be more \""authentic\"" German food than other places you should definitely come to Max's!"
1,"Excellent German food.  I went in for an early lunch, the service was great.  Had a whole feast of great dishes.  The best sauerkraut i've ever had -- subtle, with caraway.  Sweet and sour cabbage, potato salad, spaetzle, a great weisswurst, and a great wheat beer on tap."
1,"I honestly can't get enough of this place.  We used to come here after going to Pirates games since its right up the road.  Now its one of my favorite places to go out with my friends.\n\nIts a bit pricey (~$15/person), but the quality and quantity is superb.  The service is pretty good.  The atmosphere has a nice feel to it, perhaps its the antiquity.. I love the cuckoo clock and tapestries they have.\n\nNow, to the food:\nThe bread they give you... with apple butter!! ... is very fresh and tasty.  Try not to fill up on it while waiting on your huge main course.. The Bavarian soft pretzels were warm and soft when we ordered them.  Also delicious.\n\nThe sampler platter is a great deal if you don't know yet what you like.  You get 3 entrees and the typical sides for ~$16.  My favorite, though, is the schnitzel liechtenstein, with sauerkraut and potato pancakes.  Fresh and delicious everytime.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to anybody who likes ethnic, or German/Bavarian food, or just trying new stuff.  It's awesome."
1,"I work on the North Shore and have heard many coworkers rave about Max's.  When I finally tried it, I wish I had not waited so long.  Entering Max's is like going into your grandmother's living room.  Very welcoming and nostalgic.\n\nThe menu is bigger than I expected with a variety of traditional appetizers and sandwiches along with a large selection of German items.  Everything from multiple varieties of schnitzels, sausages, chickens and a sampler platter that lets you choose a combination of all of the above.  All of the items we tried were full of flavor and served at the perfect temperature.  Speaking of being full, the food is very rich so you will leave with a full stomach.  \n\nThey have a good selection of beers and even offer a sampler option.  The dessert selection looked delicious, but we were beyond stuffed so will have to savor them on a future visit.  I can't wait to go back!"
1,"Tremendous selection of German dishes.  All the sausages come from a particular manufacturer in Wisconsin that uses 100 year old methods of making them (according to the menu).  I don't know if that's a good thing or not, but they taste terrific.  \n\nThe options for sides are as plentiful as the moan dishes and the hot bacon potato salad was awesome.  \n\nDefinitely recommend giving this a try."
1,"Max's is great. It feels like your German grandmothers house and the service matches this feeling. The food is authentic and inexpensive. If you are not too familiar with German food, just ask and the waitress will walk you though the favorites.\n\nI love the sausages and the stuffed pretzels are amazing, but the Apple Fritter is the greatest thing ever."
1,"Man, I just love this place.  Pennsylvanian German for sure. Some peeps don't know the Difference. If you want real Pennsylvanian German food, then this is your place. This is the kind of food that my grandmother cooked up in Erie, and my uncle sells at the butcher shop in Girard.  Go in the off hours; cause the bar is packed at lunch and late. Also go ahead and put a coin in the machine! You'll see. It pisses the bar crowd off temporarily but so worth it!"
1,"I love this place.  The atmosphere, the bartenders, the waitresses and most of all the food. The potato pancakes are delicious as are all their soups. I think there is something for everyone here. Their desserts are all delicious. We eat here before most concert or sporting event."
1,"I somehow discovered this place when searching for sandwich places to enjoy with a friend.  How I have never noticed it when walking by it on East Ohio Street, not 10 minutes from my house, I will never understand.  Maybe because the entrance is set back from the sidewalk a bit, so it looks dark (i.e. possibly closed) when you first walk by.  Or maybe because it's overshadowed by the Isaly's next door.  Please, I beg of you, fellow Yelpers, don't ignore this place any longer!\n\nPlease note, as other reviewers have, that North Shore Deli is cash only.  But believe me, you won't need much.  They do have a website that really just lists the sandwiches they offer and their hours or see my photo of the menu board showing the sandwiches available (all named after local streets).  \n\nIt was difficult to decide on just one sandwich.  But after reading the few reviews here, I decided to go with the hot sausage.  When I first arrived, the meat was still cooking.  I didn't mind, I told the gentleman I would return and took a stroll over to Priory for some sweet treats for later.  When I returned, I was the only patron there but was greeted again and friendly small talk ensued.  I opted for a side of macaroni salad as well.  \n\nWhen I got home and unwrapped my sandwich, I was surprised by the hot sausage that looked like it was exploding at both ends.  And that it was, my friends.  Exploding with flavor, that is.  The ends were crispy and delicious and the sausage was just hot enough that the macaroni salad was the perfect cool salad compliment.  I guarantee you, this is only the first of many visits."
1,"You really need to try's this place. Great sandwiches, a hot dog/sausage cart, and friendly service!"
1,"We've stayed here twice during recent trips to Pittsburgh, and while the city itself is a bit hit and miss, the Priory is always comfortable and welcoming. A great place to escape after a long drive or a stressful drive around the maze of roads and traffic that make up Pittsburgh.\n\nEach room is pretty unique and always well appointed and very clean. The staff are friendly and helpful with whatever you might need and it's an easy drive to most of the attractions around town."
1,Great european style boutique hotel.  You can not beat this hotel for the money!
1,Awesome fast pizza
1,"I was fortunate enough to enjoy a Saturday night Oktoberfest celebration here this past weekend. A friend of mine is a member of this private German heritage club, and got tickets for me and our lady friends for this celebration.\n\nWe brought our own steins (which cost varying prices to fill throughout the night depending on whom we asked), but were always full of beer from excellent breweries like Spaten and Hofbrauhaus. We enjoyed a phenomenal buffet, with two delicious wursts, pork cutlets, potato pancakes, sauerkraut, and a whole mess of tasty German sides dishes. And we spent the next three or four hours in a handsome ballroom with folks as much as three times our age, drinking beer and enjoying awesomely German music from \""Fred Zurich and His Sound Machine\"".\n\nWhat a great time this place was! I've never had so much fun being 1/4 German in all my life. If you have a chance to visit, take it!"
1,"Good neighborhood bar/restaurant. Always good food. Never got sick, or anyone I was with get sick. Have been there with another person upto party's of 10. Always friendly staff. Usually goto Billy's once a month, maybe more. Living right on top of the hill from Billy's, we are regulars there!"
1,"There are actually 4 museums in the Carnegie Museum group in Pittsburgh. I'll review the Natural History and Art Museums in this review (separate review for the Warhol forthcoming.)\n\nThe low-down - for $15 you get admission to both the Natural History Museum and the Art Museum. It is well worth the money as you can spend hours on both sides.\n\nThe Natural History Museum is a dinosaur lover heaven. The fossils are seriously awesome, especially the one that you see when you walk in (that is still in the huge rock face.)  Just a great collection and definitely a good place for families.\n\nThe art museum has some great items in it - the Monet probably stands out for most people. I loved the \""Chariot of Aurora\"" installation - a 32 panel wall that once graced the luxury cruiseliner Normandie. There were plenty of gems in the modern collection besides the Monet - loved the John Singer Sargent and the Bourgerou. \n\nAlso impressive was the Hall of Architecture and the Hall of Sculpture. These transform you into another place and time while you are there. \n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the time I spent here and would not hesitate to come here again. Highly recommended."
1,"Totally incredible way to spend an afternoon with my family - these museums have it all! Since we have a family membership (which I highly recommend), we typically pop in for an hour or two at a time, focusing on different areas of the complex in Oakland every time we go. Our daughter seems to enjoy the dinosaurs the most, but she's also intrigued by the art collection! My favorite part is the Hall of Architecture, filled with many incredible casts of facades and sculptures. Just the fact that they have casts of the Venus de Milo and Nike of Samothrace is unbelieveable - I don't think that casting of these timeless works of art is even allowed anymore. Don't miss out on the basement kid's room, because it's full of hands-on activities for the young ones.\n\nWe will definitely keep our membership current as the years go on - it's timeless, and always fun!"
1,"It's the first time I've \""Yelped\"" anything other than a restaurant. However, after spending the better part of a day enjoying the Art/Natural History Museums, I'm branching out...guess I'm way overdue! \n\nUndoubtedly, there are plenty of bores who cannot imagine a quality museum anywhere west of Bilbao. Pay them no mind. The range and quality of exhibits at the Carnegie are rightly rich sources of pride and accomplishment to the organization and Pittsburgh. And, each and every staff member I spoke with was courteous, helpful and obviously well trained...something that's not always the case in many exalted European settings. If you're traveling with children you'll appreciate the numerous interactive areas created for the kids.  \n\nPittsburgh is so much more than football, hockey and salads with hidden french fries (tell me again why they do that?). You'll completely understand when you visit the Carnegie Museums."
1,"Decided to hit this place before hitting on 12 while the dealer shows a 9 at the Rivers.   We didn't have a reservation but the server seated us anyways (we had to be done by 7).  It is BYOB but they deal you a $4 corkage fee per person drinking.  The bread sticks were fresh and warm and were the perfect accompaniment to the delicious soup du jour, potato soup.  The side salad that comes with the meal would make the hall of fame for any side salad league.  It came with olives, Gorgonzola, julienned carrots and other veggies.  I had the pork tenderloin with veggies and mashed potatoes.   The tenderloin was perfectly cooked and the mashed potatoes were like having two aces in the hole.   It would be tough to find a better waitstaff.   Plates disappeared, water was filled, and I never knew they were there.  If your looking for a place to try before going to the casino or bucco game this is a sure bet, just call ahead for reservations.  They do have outdoor seating but the views wont show up on any postcard.  PS The 7:00 reservation called to say they were going to be late so we were allowed to relax at the table till 7:30."
1,"This is our favorite restaurant, bar none. The food is terrific, the service is top notch, they remember our names and it always feels special when we dine there. I've never had a pasta special I didn't adore. \n\nI truly feel like they are happy to see us when we come in the door and go to extra pains to treat us well and we are just an average couple who aren't spending hundreds. That doesn't matter - we are their customers. \n\nWe've been by for lunch which is very competitive price wise with nearby restaurants."
1,We made reservations for my mother's birthday for 14. No one in my family had ever been to the restaurant; we used yelp and trip advisor to find it.  They were ready for us and everything was fabulous.  \n\nI had spaghetti and meatball.  The pasta was perfectly done. The kitchen was great.  Everyone got their meals almost at the same time (which is very hard for a small restaurant with a big group).  The people were professional and friendly.  The BYOB allowed us to have wine that suited everyone's taste.  They did the pasta and non-pasta dishes very well.  \n\nThis small restaurant is a gem in an up and coming neighborhood.  We walked from the Priory Hotel on a beautiful March evening.
1,"Service is friendly and quick! Everything comes at a timely manner and all the food is fairly priced. Although it's a little small, it's really amazing! The pasta is incredible!"
1,"I have been here several times and always have a great experience! The food is always delicious, the staff is super friendly, and there are plenty of different dishes to choose from. The desserts are particularly great! The apple pie is delicious :)"
1,"I've eat'n here a few times over the last couple of years and have been very pleased with both the food and service every time.  I most recently was there on this past Saturday, which I don't recommend showing up on a Saturday without reservations,  we got the last two seats at the bar and were lucky to get those.  We ordered the pasta special and it was amazing.  It was shrimp and crab ravioli in a white wine sauce, cooked with asparagus, roasted yellow peppers, and mushrooms.  It was probably the best ravioli I ever had.  It was topped with four huge pieces of shrimp cooked to perfection.  Most meals come with either soup or salad, either is guaranteed to be delicious, and some bread served with olive oil for dipping.  Some other things I've had that I really enjoyed were the spaghetti and meatball, the hot anti-pasta, and their fudge.  Everything has a very home cooked feel to it, better than mom used to make.  They also use the freshest of ingredients, the secret to any good Italian meal.  The service here is very good too, and very friendly.  If you want a good home cooked Italian meal and warm, friendly atmosphere, this is the place for you."
1,"I ate here this past Friday evening with my girlfriend and two other dining companions.  I had made 7 PM reservations for us and we arrived shortly before that to a table that was ready for us.  The inside of the restaurant is actually much tinier than I had expected with as many people crammed in as possible.  It probably was helped that the night we were there, there was a party of 10+ next to us.  They would also order just before us understandably leading to some slower service times for us which I would guess is not the norm.  Other than it being crowded there was not much else in the dining room to look, just some table and chairs as well as some pictures on the walls.\n\nFor dinner my girlfriend and I decided to start of the evening with the polenta to share.  It came out cut into pieces and served with some sweet sausage and a pesto drizzle.  I thought that the sweet sausage was the best part of it with the polenta being ok while my girlfriend really enjoyed the polenta.  For our dinner entrees I ordered the Penne Vodka which came with a tomato basil cream sauce and prosciutto while my girlfriend went with the Penne Parma that had some artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, olives and sweet sausage in a garlic wine sauce.  Both pastas also came with salads before the meal and both my girlfriend and I ordered the house balsamic dressing.  The salads came topped with many different things and I thought that they were pretty good salads for being included in the meal.  The Penne Vodka that I ordered ended up being really good!  It was delivered when still at a fairly hot temperature and I really enjoyed the sauce.  It's only peculiar item was that the prosciutto was almost off to the side and not in the pasta which I found to be odd but I still enjoyed it.  Even though I really enjoyed my pasta, I actually thought that my girlfriends meal tasted better.  The garlic wine sauce on hers was awesome and made each bite of her entr\u00e9e that I had a treat.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here again.  I was very happy with all of the food that we had and also loved that the prices were good for the quality of food that they were serving."
1,"After reading some peoples reviews I wasn't sure of this place. My boyfriend and I decided to go anyways. All I can say is, wow you people don't know food if you left a negative remark! Our food was phenomenal. The service was phenomenal. No it isn't a super fancy place, but the food is incredible and very reasonably priced. Our $56 dinner was worth every penny. I had a special, he had ravioli's and we split a desert. Amazing little place that I will 100% go to again."
1,"Caruso's is the best place to buy beer (and pop and snacks and smokes) on the northside by far. Hidden in its original spot in the Mexican War Streets, Caruso's is a home away from home. He has a wide range, from cheep crap to really really good stuff. If you don't see it he will try to get it in. You can go and just hang if you want as well. Dogs welcome. Family owned since 1930 and Sam has been there for 40 years. Do yourself a favor and stop by."
1,"I haven't been a member of the Allegheny YMCA for very long, but I've had a great experience so far.\n\nThe building itself is on the older side -- I'd guess it's probably about 100 years old.  The equipment, however, is pretty modern, and many of the rooms have been retrofitted for modern gym conveniences such as air conditioning.  \n\nThe Allegheny YMCA has the following features:\n1) A room with cardio machines (some traditional elliptical trainers, some of the newer breed of elliptical trainers that are like a mating between a stair-stepper and an elliptical, rowing machines, and exercise bikes).  Most of the cardio machines are only about a year old and have those weird little TVs mounted on top, so you can see Barack Obama's mouth silently moving as you get your workout.\n2) A basketball court with a track on top of it (28 laps = 1 mile).\n3) A spinning studio.\n4) A pretty decent weightlifting room, with a good balance between weight machines and free weights.  There's also a good range of free weights, so a weakling like me and a strong man like the dude I saw with biceps bigger than my waist can both use the weight room.\n5) A pool that is not Olympic size, but is big enough to get in a decent workout by swimming lengths.\n6) Secure access to the women's locker room (as well as to the fancy men's locker room).\n7) A group exercise room.  Group exercise classes are included in the membership fee, and the instructors are really nice and also inspiring/motivating.  There's a good range of classes for all ages and fitness levels, including Pilates, yoga, water aerobics, spinning, and cardio kickboxing.\n\nThe membership fees are pretty reasonable here (a family membership for 2 adults and 2 children is $58/month plus a $125 joining fee), and if you are employed by UPMC, you get an additional discount.\n\nMost importantly, the Allegheny YMCA is a very welcoming place, regardless of your age, gender, or current fitness level.  Gyms can be intimidating if you aren't in the greatest shape to begin with, and some gyms have members who aren't kind towards women who aren't super-fit or super-skinny.  But at the Allegheny Y, everyone I have met has been extremely friendly and nice to me, which is the best incentive to keep going to the gym."
1,"I'm still giving this Y five stars because I like the other patrons and the atmosphere so much; I just want to re-evaluate the place now that I've gotten way better at various activities.\n\nThe cardio room is still really, really good.  I've never had to wait for a machine, and the machines are quite nice and new still.  \n\nThe weightlifting room is also totally adequate, with pretty much a full complement of machines (older, but still serviceable), and a good assortment of free weights and related paraphernalia, including a Smith machine and a regular good ol' power cage.  There isn't any platform for Olympic lifts, and I haven't seen anyone in here perform them (there isn't a lot of room, so I'm not really sure how one would even go about powerlifting safely in this gym.)  However, there is a bucket of chalk in one corner.  Go figure.\n\nThe pool is fine if you aren't really hardcore into swimming.  If swimming is a major form of exercise for you, however, it might not be the best pool for your needs.  It's a four-lane pool, I think 25 yards long.  It is heavily chlorinated, and it tends to be QUITE warm, especially on Monday mornings (this is because kids with sickle-cell anemia use the pool on Sundays, and the water needs to be especially warm for them -- it hasn't cooled down yet by Monday.)  Since I am at Pitt, I have access to the pool at Trees Hall, which is superior by any metric, so I use that instead.\n\nI like this Y quite a lot and wouldn't consider switching, even though there are newer/fancier Y's in the area."
1,"Awesome spot to grab a dog for a buck. Nothing fancy, must standard ingredients and friendly service."
1,"Classic North Side staple.  The food is made to order, the service is fast, and the staff is great.  My stand order is hot dog with onions and a side of fries.  But the grilled cheese is also exceptional.  The lunch line can be unreal, so I usually just stop for dinner on my way home from work.\n\nCASH ONLY."
1,"I came here with a party of 40 very hungry Pitt students. The food was amazing. We had roasted beef, chicken, and pasta. The management was lovely and really involved during any party issues. The staff was also very kind and able to keep everyone's glass full, despite our camel like drinking habits. Thank you!"
1,"Absolutely the best!!!  \n\nNot from Pittsburgh.  Was there on vacation with my kids.  They absolutely LOVED IT.  Even my youngest, who is hard to entertain, left the place praising it.  If you have kids and are in Pittsburgh, this is a great place to take them.  We have been to other city's children's museums and this is one of the best.\n\nThere are tons of stuff for them to do.  There is also a nice variety.  Something for everyone.  Even my wife and I were entertained.  The price of admission was well worth it considering movies are about $10 for only 1-2 hours.  We were there for at least 5 hrs and it didn't even feel like it.  The best was there were activities that left you with free \""souvenirs\"".  We left with various art creations that the kids made that were really cool."
1,"Oh my God. They're playing the chicken dance song on their website! Bahaha!\n\nSo what is so great about this place? Mister Rogers of course! For those not in the know, Fred Rogers was from Pittsburgh, so of course there will be a great display of his world somewhere in the city. And here it is. \n\nBeyond that there are always cool displays up in the rest of the museem. Bottom line: Great for adults and kids alike, another of the must see Pittsburgh sites."
1,"Why would I be writing a review of a Children's museum when I don't have any children?!  Because it's an awesome museum, that's why!\n\nBut in all seriousness, they throw the best parties, mostly because they have thee coolest space to do it in!  When you go to a party at the museum you're allowed to \""play\"" just like a kid would during regular business hours.  \n\nHave I gone down the twisted slide connected to the treehouse in a cocktail dress?  Yes I have!  Have I walked across the mini Pittsburgh bridge in the mini-Pittsburgh playroom?  Yes I have!  \n\nLike any good museum, they constantly have changing exhibits, so things I saw are probably not there anymore.  But the interactive exhibits are all about participation.  If it peeked my interest, I'm sure it would peek a child's! I have no doubt people of any age would have a great time here!"
1,This place is amazing from top to bottom. 2 hours down we are still here.
1,"This place is a blast for kids of all ages! All floors are packed full of great fun for kids, and make this place a nice way to spend a lazy Saturday with your turbo-charged little one - just be sure you are well-rested before you go!\n\nThe only place that was a bit much was the water zone, but that's to be expected whenever you join a young child and lots of splashy water fun. Our little one looked like she worked on \""The Deadliest Catch\"" after she was done terrorizing the place, but it was well worth it to see her having such a good time; it's similar to the \""other\"" kids' museum nearby. They are renovating this exhibit, and it will be interesting to see how it evolves.\n\nLoved the art studio, the garage, and the nursery, where our little one really had a blast running around and playing with all of the activities. Obviously, the section on Mr. Rogers brought back all sorts of warm, fuzzy memories! Admission was completely reasonable, and a membership is totally worth it if you will visit with two adults and one child 3x in one year; you even get reciprocal admission to many science and childrens' museums nationwide!"
1,"I moved from Columbus, OH to Pittsburgh and was elated to find out that my COSI membership in Columbus was still usable at the Children's Museum. While C-bus's children's museum is mainly about science, Pittsburgh's has art and what not going on. \n\nMy son loves this place and has finally discovered the art room. He's not super creative but he likes the fact that he can pop on an apron and paint. He even threw a clay cup and silk screened some paper cut outs.\n\nThey have other workshop space where you can sew or build lil motors. The changing tough art exhibits are neat too. \n\nOn the downside, if an exhibit opens try to see it early. Simply because kids tear shit up. We went on the opening day of Clifford and by the final week props were missing and there were kid bite marks on Clifford's bones o.0 ."
1,"I love this museum! I've gone several times with friends and their children. There are so many fun things for kids to go, and so much to explore, even if you are an adult.\n\nKids seem to love the art stations where there are always a variety of crafts and items to create/construct. I love how they are always changing exhibits to stay current and keep things fun and creative for the regulars. \n\nMy favorite thing about this museum is the \""funhouse\"" slide area. My nephew loves this slide and loves the anti-gravity feel when he is inside. It's too fun!"
1,"was in the neighborhood on a girls weekend. this place is fantastic.  great prices, great slice.  service is a tad bit slow (since they make it to order!) but the food is worth the wait. they seemed to be doing a great take out/carry out order,  If you are in the area, stop by . . . it is totally worth it!"
1,"Steel Pride, baby! Always gonna love the black and gold!\n\nEvery city I have lived in has had more than one Steeler bar. Never fear, if you a fan outside the Burgh, check out: http://www.post-gazette.com/steelers/steelerbars.asp to find out where you can watch a game with the Steeler faithful."
1,"As I sit in my living room, gazing at the baby sized Steelers hat that I wore as a newborn arriving home from the hospital, it's obvious I have no choice but to bleed black and gold.\n\nI've been there for my Steelers (oh, our Steelers, your Steelers) through seasons good and bad (even last season). I have screamed my head off at those ESPN analysts who constantly underrate (if they don't ignore) my black and gold (oh, and  by the way, did you know that Ben had a motorcycle accident, an emergency appendectomy, and a concussion last year? did you hear about that? didya?). I have thrown away one perfectly good Troy Polamalu jersey for fear it was cursed (and replaced it with an excellent number 43 throwback jersey). And, when I lived in San Francisco, I woke up for 10am games and had a beer in my hand before kickoff.\n\nThere is nothing, nothing in this world that could ever get me to root against the Steelers, or to believe anything other than the Steelers are the best football team in the history of professional American football. \n\nPlus, Heinz field is easily the most beautiful stadium in the nation. \n\nNow, we just need a ring for that other hand..."
1,"The Steelers are the coolest team in football. They have the best colors, city, history, most fans, etc. \n\nAnd they pretty much dominate."
1,5 time Super Bowl champs.
1,"Being born in 1970 was about perfect. Pittsburgh was becoming the City of Champions. The Steelers will always be my favorite team. I even have the logo on my neck, under my ear :D  Mostly having this tat lets me know where the Steelers bars are in other towns, as soon as someone sees it the usually tell me."
1,"I didn't even like football before I moved to Pittsburgh, but that all changed when I discovered the glory of the Pittsburgh Steelers.  I came here in 2005 and got totally sucked into the march towards the 5th Super Bowl win, and I never have become uninfatuated.  Now I scream and wave the Terrible Towel around in the air with the best of 'em.   I'm crossing my fingers that we'll be the first to 6 Super Bowl wins..."
1,A ring for each finger and a sixth for my... \n\nother hand!  \n\nYou're dirty!\n\nGo Steelers!!!
1,"Steelers, you did not let us down. I have nothing but love for this team, this city, and its fans. I waited a full day to write this so that it wouldn't sound too obsessed.\n\nBut, that's 6 times, baby! You can't fuck with that. That's the best EVER.\n\nI want to thank my Mom and my Dad, for having me on the western side of the great state of Pennsylvania. I also want to thank them for being the best and least annoying people to watch football with.\n\nI want to thank Mom specifically for giving me a general ADHD-proof explanation of what the hell is going on during a football game. I'd never be able to watch football if it weren't for her. I also want to thank her for freaking out and screaming the way I did when #92 intercepted the football and ran it 100 yards into the Pittsburgh end zone. I'd also like to thank her for not getting mad when I started jumping on her furniture when #10 made a game-winning catch with 2:4x left to go in the 4th. I also want to thank her for making Dad and me delicious chili and a Steelers cake so that we wouldn't get ill from all the excitement.\n\nI want to thank Dad specifically for his love of the game and for explaining its intricacies to me [but only after Mom has had her say first.] I also want to thank Dad for laughing with Mom and I rather than at Mom and I. \n\nI want to thank the iron and steel workers who have made the three rivers region what it is and for inspiring the best football team in the NFL and for being its best fans. For once, the working class comes out ahead!\n\nI want to thank #43 Troy Palomalu for intercepting and scoring at 40 yards, thus sealing a Steeler victory during the AFC Championship vs. the Ravens. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdlQ28cqgr8\n\nI want to thank our even-tempered head coach Mike Tomlin for guiding our boys to a 2009 Super Bowl victory.\n\nI want to thank #92 James Harrison, NFL.com Defensive Player of the Year, for making an unforgettable interception in the Cardinals' end zone and running it 100 yards into the Steelers' end zone! Damn, bitches! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyeAypl7xkI\n\nI want to thank Cardinal #11 Steve Breaston for blocking fellow Cardinal #15 Larry Fitzgerald during our record setting 100 yard run.

You left us breathless when your feet touched the end zone. Love. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ijHpXrSgQQ\n\nI want to thank the Cardinals for an unexpectedly good game. (LOL-I accidentally wrote Ravens at first!)\n\nI want to thank Liz for rooting for the Steelers. I guess I'll thank Scott for going for the Cardinals, so I had a face to rub our victory into. \n\nGo Pittsburgh! I love the Steelers! XOXO! S.W.A.K."
1,"I wanted to choose something special for my 100th review.  It has to be something near and dear to my heart...I choose to rate my most favorite professional sports team, the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nBeing that I was born in Western Pennsylvania and raised in Pittsburgh during the dawn of the Steel Curtain, the Immaculate Reception, and the four Super Bowls in the late 70's and early 80's, it is hard to find a better reason to not rate this sports team a 5 Yelp Stars.  Now that the 21st Century is started....2 more Lombardi trophies were added.  I am not saying dynasty, but this team has a history of success and it is not hard to say for a small market team...this team is very successful.\n\nAs a fan of National Football League and the Pittsburgh Steelers, this team is a model for the way other organizations should be managed.\n\nDallas and San Francisco are in the holding pattern at 5 Super Bowls.  New England, New York Giants, and the Indianapolis Colts' does not have the history and only time will tell.....here we go Steelers, here we go!!!"
1,"She's dressed in black and yellow, she says \""Hello,\ncome sit next to me you fine fellow.\""\nYou run over there without a second to lose\nAnd what comes next, Steelers bust a move!!!"
1,"Perfect experience for this Steelers fan from Maryland. Had the walk up tour, tour guide knew exactly what she was talking about with a great personality to match. Had a really great time :)"
1,"Seattle may have just won the 2014 Super Bowl, but the Steelers still rock with six rings, Baby!!! Just stating what all Steeler fans know: a Steel Dynasty is still unmatched no matter what team claims the title of current Super Bowl Champs.. Go Steelers!!!"
1,"Yay for Steelers! It's awesome that Mike Tomlin looks like Omar Epps. Also Pittsburgh food is awesome. Pierogi, pork and sauerkraut, hoagies, pizza, and stuffed cabbage rolls."
1,Go Pirates!!! That's all I can say. They've made me love baseball and Pittsburgh again. They're only going to get better.
1,My wife and I have visited St. Anthony's Chapel three time so far and every time the experience is a moving one.  I would recommend the guided tour.  The amount of relics contained in the chapel is amazing.  If you a person of faith this is a wonderful place.
1,"This is a gem in Pittsburgh.  The owner, Tom, and the workers will remember your name.  Its just like being in a small town.  Fresh meat and friendly people.  The meat is the best I have found in the city and is affordable too.  The best steaks I have ever eaten have been purchased from there and cooked in my own kitchen!  They are also very knowledgeable.  They can answer any question you have about what cut of meat to choose or how to cook something.  They're also more than happy to share tried and true recipes, which have always worked out for me."
1,"My dog means the world to me and I couldn't imagine anyone better to handle her care than Dr. Dorn. I grew up raising puppies as a family hobby and became very attached to quality care from a vet in my hometown. My standards for a vet are high and I was more than pleasantly surprised by WLAH. \n\nMy first experience with Dr. Dorn was no more than 2 weeks after my adoption of my dog. I was pretty certain that she had UTI and it was confirmed. He was such a nice doctor and all of his staff was understandable and sweet. It also felt like a family environment and the office building is adorable. I didn't feel like I was taking my dog to some overly commercial MedVet (the worst place you can go) or chain. The whole appointment, plus medicine, plus taking out her stitches (for free) was $45. I was in shock! It was very reasonable.\n\nNo matter where you live in the city, I highly recommend Dr. Dorn!"
1,"Great small grocer!\n\nGiant Eagle offers a lot of things, but they don't offer me everything I am looking for when I go shopping.  Kuhn's, on the other hand, offers all of those little idiosyncrasies and nuances that I look for that I cannot find anywhere else.  The biggest thing for me is the fact that they carry Boar's Head brand luncheon meats.  I really don't know how anyone eats any other brand of luncheon meat since they all just taste so stale in comparison.  \n\nI can tell that a higher number of Italian-American folk patronize this store as well.  Why? The pasta selection is awesome.  I despise the typical noodles carried everywhere else; but here I can find the noodles that I have grown to love.  \n\nGetting beyond the reasons above, I do enjoy the store as a whole and the fact that I can find what I am looking for.  I will definitely be returning; I just have to make certain to be careful of the parking situation since this particular store's parking lot layout is prone to jamming.  In this case, it is better to park near PNC and walk."
1,"Best shop by far in the South Hills.  Purchased a Cannondale 29er there, and have had numerous service visits for various bikes.  Always helpful and always call to let you know when service is fixed.  If you are in the market for a Cannondale in the South Hills this place has better customer service BY FAR than the other South Hills Cannondale dealer."
1,Always leaving incredibly happy
1,"Because I am the cheapskatiest of cheapskates, I love Groupon, but I have always been wary of buying Groupons for things like haircuts - they're so personal, and when they go wrong, they can go SO VERY WRONG. \n\nBut, feeling particularly poor and without having established a favorite hair person here in Pittsburgh, I took a chance and bought a Groupon for Sergios.  I even made an appointment with someone totally unknown - no yelp reviews, no word of mouth approval, no bio on the website, no nothing!  That's right y'all I can be spontaneous.   Good thing I only had highlights & a trim planned...and lucky me, it was fantastic.\n\nYou can tell that the space has fairly recently transitioned from down-home barbershop to classy salon (due to a change of ownership from father to son, apparently).  All of the staff seemed uniformly very young and very hip, but still friendly and accommodating.  The music was all 90s and 2000s pop and alternative throwbacks that were such a delight.  And my mystery hairstylist was awesome - Dave not only gave me a really great cut and the most thorough highlighting of my life, but he also charmed my pants off - just a genuine, friendly, interesting fellow.\n\nI highly recommend this little gem - and if you've never been to Dormont, here's your chance! (I hear there's karaoke at the Apple on Tuesdays...)"
1,"I am a huge fan of Sushi Three. They live within walking distance of my home, so it's no problem getting here and the temptation for sushi is always in the back of my mind! Admittedly, the price of the food here tends to keep my cravings in check for a couple months at a time, but when I do come here, I enjoy every bite. Occasionally I also order take-out since they have very reasonable lunch deals, but really, I prefer to sit and eat at the restaurant itself.\n\nSpeaking of: the place itself is very quiet, which I actually like; I can just sit, talk with a friend or read a book, and then (what a radical concept) enjoy my food in peace. This is a big deal for me because the other places I know of where I can get sushi are loud, busy, and quite frankly, a little limiting options-wise compared to Sushi Three's menu. If I want sushi, I either come here or I get a small pack at Giant Eagle. That's how much I hate the other sushi places I've visited in Pittsburgh. If I'm going to pay as much as I do for my fish, I want to be in a place I can sit and actually enjoy my food.\n\nBy the way, Sushi Three does serve things other than sushi, so people looking for some Japanese food that isn't rice and fish are definitely going to find something. There's some really delicious beef, chicken and pork dishes. But of course, a place with the word \""sushi\"" in its name is going to specialize in sushi, and there are pages and pages of sushi options available here. The orders come in various styles and sizes as well, so couples can get something to share or just get something smaller for themselves. The combos all come with soup and salad, which are also very yummy.\n\nI at this point have developed a routine order: a large salad and an order of softshell crab rolls are all I need here. Sure, I'll occasionally snag a bite from someone here with me, but the truth is that Sushi Three makes such enormous orders that I can't eat more than that without feeling a bit sick. \n\nBut hey, at least you get your money's worth! I say definitely give this place a shot if you're a sushi fan."
1,"I go there as a tradition with my best friend when she comes home and it's one of my favorite places. The resteraunt is quiet and low lit so it's very relaxing. Service is quick and friendly. The lunch specials are amazing deals and there's enough variety there that I never get bored with the choices. Their tempura is the best i've ever had, and the rest of their food is just as amazing. Their ginger dressing makes me want to drink it straight. Even thinking about it has set me drooling!"
1,"I love how it's the only restaurant that is open 24 hours near Mt Lebanon\n\nIt's always good food, even after a night out at the bars."
1,"One of the best pastries I've had in my life I got here. I think it's called a \""French bearclaw.\"""
1,"Any pittsburgher knows the top 3 pizza joints: Beto's, Fiori's, and Vesuvio's. Beto's is my favourite. \n\nI was never a fan of square pizza until I was introduced to this place. I love how they put the cheese on very last & isn't melted when they serve it to you. if you want extra cheese they give you a whole bag of shredded cheese. and it's cheap!! .99 a slice!\n\nI can't wait until I'm back in the 'burgh to take my fianc\u00e9 there so he can see what real pizza is like."
1,"Some of my favorite pizza on the planet. If you haven't had it remember, it is unique, don't walk in expecting 'factory' pizza. It is square cut and the cheese is put on after the crust and sauce are cooked. MONEY!\n\nIf you are taking it out get the cheese on the side, we even get 'extra cheese' a lot of the time.\n\nToppings: most toppings on the pizza are put on after it is cooked also. I usually go straight cheese ( not a fan of cold pep or mushrooms) \n\nThe sause is old school nothing fancy but darn good, nice chunks of tomatos in the sauce.  \n\nIf your in town worth the experience, if you live near by...lucky you!"
1,"I was out with lesbian friend of Joe D the night before new years eve. Note to self: veggie burgers are not a meal for a man. After seeing Harry Potter 7.1 at the theatre we both proclaimed we were hungry for abnormal pizza. Let me explain, we didn't want to order generic, neighborhood delivery pizza. Pretty much I'm tired of tasteless, no crust pies that lack nuance. Since lesbian friend of Joe D lives in Dormont, Beto's was a natural. She's never had the beto's experience. So I told her to follow my lead, I ordered two slices, one with black olives, the other was plain, small drink. She ordered two slices , extra cheese and pepperoni. I forgot to tell her, nay, I purposely didn't tell her about the cheese because I knew she'd turn her nose up at it because the idea of cheese not melted on a pizza would surely upset the planets and cause disruption in the space/time continuem. But it backfired on me and the one thing I didn't expect was her to order extra cheese. \n\nWe sat down and I explained to her the total stupidity of ordering a large drink in a place that offers free refills. Order a small, it's way cheaper and this really sounds like a scene that could have played out on an episode of Seinfeld.\n\nPizza time! The look on her face was one of shock, like mine when I realized that America was indeed stupid enough to elect George Bust for a second term. The cheese was piled high, and no visible evidence of anything under this massive mass of diary goodness. Like a trooper she picked up a slice and dived in. She liked it!\n\nAfter we downed our slices I told her how sitting here has brought me back to my high school years. The pizza still has that same texture, creamy cool cheese, warm crunchy crust, and wonderful smell. Beto's is still my choice for best pie in the Burgh"
1,"You have to be goofy to not like this pizza. Their sauce is tangy and delicious, probably the best I ever had, and The crust is perfectly crunchy not doughy and chewy which I cant stand. Truly unique and worth a try. I will be back."
1,"So you walk in and proceed to the counter.  You order the pizza with whatever toppings you so desire.  You get handed your drink cups and a number to put on your table and try and find a seat.  Maybe a 15 to 20 minute wait for your pizza.  Your pizza comes out and...... \""what the hell is this?  Take this back!  My cheese ain't melted and the pepperoni ain't cooked!\""  Chill my man.....take a few deep breaths....it'll be ok.....just TASTE it......there ya go.....holy cheese right?!  What a blend....It's all over the place and people actually order extra!  That sauce, nice.....sweet and chunky....yummy.  And the crust....the crispy, chewy wonderful foundation that holds it all together.   It's a bit different.  But different in the best way.  There's some great pizza out there.  Different styles and different tastes.  Do yourself a favor.  If you're in the Banksville Rd./ Dormont area stop in this place....it's just delicious."
1,"Thinking cold toppings is going to tast great sounds odd....... But, this is great pizza. \nWhen you commit to doing something as odd as cold toppings you are going to strike out or hit a homer. Betos hit a Grandslam. \nPlease stop in. It's a dive but it's outrageously good!!!"
1,"Okay this place is freaking wild. If your from my generation than you can remember Ellio's rectangular frozen pizza. This place brings me back. Any place that goes there, then you know they're doing something right. \n\nIf you go here you will be in cheese heaven. I agree with the other people's review that you will either love this place or absolutely hate it. I'd have to give it a thumbs up but instead of calling it pizza, call it beto's raw cheese baked bread haha. They cook the bread sauce/tomatoes and then throw a heaping cheese pile after your meal is cooked. Then they throw on any toppings. I call it raw cheese pizza. It is good. Crust is crispy and the sauce is delicious. \n\nEatability I'd give a 2/10. The whole point of pizza is that you can bend it in half and then stuff it in your face. Here it's more of a fork and knife operation. The cheese falls right off because it's not melted so you end up slurping it up like spaghetti. \n\nI dig it though. Good job beto's. Way to stand out from the mediocre pizza that plagues pittsburgh."
1,"Nowhere else quite like betos. If you love cheese and like trying something different this place is awesome.  I grew up in Pittsburgh and get back rarely,  but when I do I go out of my way to grab a couple slices!"
1,One of my favorite pizza spots in Pittsburgh.  Been coming here for years.  The only downside is if you go and they are just putting a pizza into the oven.  The wait to grab your cuts can be a long wait.  Well worth it because of how damn good it is.
1,"My husband and I visited Lighting by Erik yesterday and were absolutely blown away with the amount of product in the store! This is the BEST place in Pittsburgh to find lighting. We were in the market for a nice crystal chandelier for our kitchen and had more than enough choices to pick from. We have had a hard time before yesterday finding a nice enough crystal chandelier in town (or getting good customer service from other stores). Also, had the problem of not being able to see merchandise at other places. NOT the case at Lighting by Erik! We worked with one of the owner's and she was a complete joy to work with, and full of passion for her job (a rare find these days)! She took her time, was thorough and made sure we loved what we were buying. Also, very impressed with their selection of fan options. They also have many catalogs with high quality and unique ceiling fans, which was a huge perk for us, wanting something more unique. I highly recommend this store to anyone who has great taste! They also have a fantastic selection of lamps, mirrors, tables and other home decor items. Will absolutely be purchasing from them again. Check it out, you will be impressed."
1,Metro came to my home as scheduled and restored my air conditioning. Rich was my Metro rep and explained everything so a layman could understand.\nI was completely satisfied. They do excellent work.\nI would use them again.
1,I wasn't expecting much but they surely over delivered.  I thought it was just another bar.  It had the bar vibe.  I didn't think the food would be this good.  I am impressed that most of the food is made in-house.  I actually don't remember what I got since it was several weeks ago that I went.  All I know was that the food was much better than any bar food I had.  I would come here again.
1,"Good local bar with lots of TVs, good draft selection, and better than average bar food. Definitely a step up from the Saloon."
1,Great food and atmosphere. Sweet potato waffle fries are the best. Great for Pirate games.
1,Great place to watch a game. Friendly staff went out of their way to get my game on even though the Steelers were on at the same time.
1,The wings here are fantastic and the cheese sticks are absurd in a very good way. Will definitely be back.
1,"I love this place. Normally, it would have been 4.5 stars, but since they moved to a smoke free environment, it gets a 5 star rating. The staff is quick, friendly and very \""with it.\"" This is a true family business and the food is fantastic. I love the jumbot! It's amazing and hearty. The coffee isn't the best, but the food makes up for it. The french toast and pancakes are lovely too. This is not the place to go if you are dieting as they are GENEROUS with the butter. I like this place way better than Pamelas, which, apart from the strawberry crepes, doesn't really do it for me. It was recently on the Food Network too so I'm not the only one that feels that way!"
1,"Went this this morning and I am wondering why the hell it tool me so long to go here. Awesome food, fresh and the staff was even better. Won't eat anywhere else for breakfast in the burg! Gotta get here"
1,My breakfast was absolutely phenomenal. I specifically ordered the ham and eggs because it included their famous potato pancakes. They did not disappoint I tried every trick in the book to get what they put in them but no luck. I even promised some things I should be ashamed of LOL I would definitely recommend that if you are anywhere within 50 miles you need to make a trip here!
1,"I had no idea that this restaurant was \""legendary\"" when I decided to eat there this morning with my family.  I was severely hungover and just needed some grease, and the concierge at my mother's hotel happened to recommend this place.\n\nThe restaurant is \""cozy\"" (read: small) and situated in a really quaint neighborhood at the top of a massive (and somewhat scary) hill. The restaurant itself was buzzing and had a great neighborhood vibe. Despite it being *packed,* we were seated right away.\n\nThe menu wasn't too fussy but there were a lot of options. I ordered the dor-stop burger (burger with sauteed onions and green peppers, american cheese and two slices of texas toast) and fries. My husband got the mushroom swiss burger with onion rings and we split our meals. The food was simple enough but amazingly delicious. I think they battered the onion rings in crack. I also ordered an orange juice, which I could tell was fresh squeezed.\n\nThe portion sizes were reasonable too! Not gigantic, which I appreciate. I finished my meal feeling like a brand new woman. \n\nI think I'll look for reasons to come to Pittsburgh now that I know this restaurant exists. Yum."
1,"Like many others before me I came to the Dor-Stop with high expectations and let me tell you, my expectations were exceeded.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been looking for a new breakfast spot for a while and the Dor-Stop has always been high on my list to try.\n\nThe place is classic, still has a bar counter, kitschy items adorn the walls and the a feeling that you are dining in your grandmother's restaurant. The place is always packed but we were quickly seated and like many have stated before my coffee cup never fell below 3/4 full before it was refilled.\n\nNow lets get to the nitty gritty: the food.\n\nI got the pancake breakfast, usually a very simple and easy breakfast but when the breakfast came I was so impressed. The hotcakes are so different, some would even say magical. They are so fluffy and moist and complimented their super crispy bacon. I almost wanted to fold the entire breakfast up and eat a giant pancake eggarito. My mouth is watering thinking about it.\n\nMy girlfriend got the breakfast sandwich which was very well done. Their ham is so succulent and tender. They cut it off the bone at the Dor-Stop and is shows. The sandwich is a work of art and is the classiest breakfast sandwich I have ever seen. \n\nI recommend this place to anyone and will definitely come back to try some other types of pancakes. They are the best in the city.\n\nOh and try the potato pancakes, they will rock your world."
1,"Yelpers, once again you all came through!  Being fairly new to the city, the only real breakfast place I have found is Pamela's.  After reading Yelp this morning my friend and I went to Dor-Stop.  You guys rocked!  We had to wait 20 minutes but walked around the neighborhood (really should do a huge workout before AND after eating here!) then it was time for us to be seated.  The waitress was excellent!  They were packed so it took about 30 minutes to get our food but she kept our glasses of iced tea filled the whole time (and brought out a new glass of ice for each of us to refill).  I ordered the pancakes while my friend ordered a vegetarian omelet.  We ordered one order of potato pancakes to share.  \n\nBoth us really enjoyed our meals a lot!  Thanks again Yelpers, now I have a new favorite breakfast place!"
1,"Don't go for healthy, go for tasty comfort food. Great pancakes. Expect a long wait on weekends!"
1,"Another 5-star find in the Pittsburgh area. I kid you not. Guy Fieri hyped the right place.  It is hands down the best diner in the universe.  Actually, I don't know that for sure, but I dare you to find a better diner anywhere in the United States.\n\nThe food here is made with love and that's what makes it stand out out. You can taste the love in every single bite.  The staff of this family-owned restaurant run like a well-oiled machine, used to the crazy crowds that come here every day to blow their diets and binge.  This was all a girl could ask for on a cheat day.\n\nI had Vicki's Italian Jumbot but with Guy Fieri's twist on it, making it a little more spicy. It was more than enough for Jim and I to share.  We also shared the fantastic pumpkin pancakes. They do not need syrup at all. So fluffy, so delicious and gut-busting.  Why do I have to live in D.C?  I would be here every weekend for brunch.  There is nothing like this place over here..wahhh!   This place is great for sharing so order different dishes and eat them family style. The portions are gigantic and unforgiving! \n\nAnyway, do not come to Dor-Stop thinking they have become over-commercialized because  of their appearance on the Food Network. They have not. They are the same family-owned established where you can get no nonsense  service and absolutely amazing food.  If you are in Pittsburgh, run don't walk to Dormont and grab a seat at Dor-Stop.  This is a glutton's dream come true."
1,"My in-laws saw the Dor-Stop on DDD and wanted to try it out. When I found out they were famous for their pancakes, I hopped right on board. We went on a Sunday morning and was told the wait would be 20 minutes. After about 10, four seats opened up at the counter so we snagged them. We got to know the staff as we perused the menu. We were right next to the cash register and the (I'm assuming) owner was a gentle drill sergeant doling out orders. \n\nI had the banana chocolate chip pancakes with a side of sausage. The three generously-sized pancakes were sweet with a crispy edge and were loaded with fruit and chocolate. Ohmygod. Some of the best pancakes I've ever had. I stuffed myself silly knowing I wouldn't be able to come back next weekend and do it all again. The sausage patties were really tasty and not greasy at all. I had to fend off T who kept getting samples. :) I also tried T's apple cinnamon pancakes which had dollops of apple pie filling and just the right amount of cinnamon. My father-in-law had the strawberry-stuffed French toast and my mother-in-law had the walnut French toast. I didn't try either but they looked amazing. \n\nI would DEFINITELY come back here if I lived in the area. Pay no mind to the wait time. Bring a book, bring someone you love to chat with. It's worth it!"
1,"This place just plain had it all, simple as that.  I saw the joint on Triple D and knew I wanted to check it out when I was in Pittsburgh for work.  Especially since it is known for breakfast, which is my favorite meal!\n\nThe Dor Stop is especially known for its pancakes, and they have several to chose from.  After some contemplation I decided on the Pumpkin Pancakes.  And what a great decision it was!  They were amazing!  I put syrup on them, because I'm a sugar whore, but they honestly didn't need it!  They were big, moist, and perfectly sweetened all by themselves!  So tasty!  \n\nAnother nice thing about the place is that it's not in Pittsburgh but, rather in the Dormont area outside the 'Burg.  A rather quaint little area it was.  So get down there and check it out!  You won't be disappointed!"
1,Excellent breakfast. Regular pancakes rocked. Staff was super and we were seated immediately on a Saturday. So lucky. My first 5 star rating on Yelp.
1,WOW!  Great staff and great food.  Got in quick and got out quick and cheap.  Did the regular breakfast with 2 pumpkin hot cakes on the side and they were out of this world.\n\nI'm glad they were on YELP or I never would have none of my new favorite breakfast place.\n\nTC
1,"I've been going to Dor-Stop for years (well before the DDD crowd arrived).  While I'm thrilled to see Bob and Vicky's crew thriving, I do have to say that I miss being able to actually walk-in on a Saturday or Sunday without a line around the block.\n\nIrregardless, when you're looking for unique spins on traditional diner fare, this is your joint.\n\nThe pancakes are all fantastic.  I've had every combination on the menu and then plenty more (they'll usually grant a request if they have the ingredients and they usually run a weekend special).  I highly suggest the apple walnut, banana chocolate chip, the oatmeal raisin, and most importantly...  PUMPKIN (the best in town).\n\nLori's Raspberry French Toast is the obligatory first dine, just stay away from the other iterations that aren't first coated in corn flakes prior to landing on the griddle.\n\nThe jumbots, eggs benedict, and potato pancakes all also represent fantastic choices.  If you have a choice of meat, hands down get the \""ham off the bone\"".\n\nOne other key note...  Bob, Vicky, and their daughter Lori go out of their way to make people happy.  They always bring samples out to those waiting for a seat and offer coffee to hold people over when it's cold out.\n\nIf you're running solo or with one in tow, I recommend you check to see if there are spots at the bar (first come first serve)."
1,"Tonya our waitress was perfect! Her recommendations we all excellent! From Chicago attending a funeral. Checked triple-D, and glad I did! Oatmeal Raisin pancakes were unbelievable! I don't where they get their eggs but they were huge and fresh over easy for me! Must stop if ever in Pittsburgh!"
1,"AMAZING!  I've been wanting to try this place for years and finally made it.  Ever since I saw it featured on the Food Network I've been wanting to go.\n\nWe went for breakfast and I ordered the stuffed raspberry french toast.  I ended up getting the cherry though...  I took a bite and while it was good I really wanted the raspberry.  I let them know and they quickly replaced my order with what I wanted and took it totally off the bill because they felt bad I had to wait longer for my food.  That was really unexpected and really nice!\n\nOnce I tried the raspberry stuffed french toast I loved it, really really good.  There are so many other things on the menu that I would love to try as well such as the banana chocolate chip pancakes, the breakfast burrito, ect.\n\nI would certainly go back to this place and hope that I do the next time I am in the Pittsburgh area.  So so good."
1,"This place has NEVER disappointed when it comes to the food coming out of their kitchen. The lines occasionally go out the door but the wait is never very long. I have had many different items off the menu as it is a place my girlfriend and I frequent.\n\nIf you can ever get the Sausage Gravy and Biscuits, I would highly recommend, and this is coming from a very country boy who was raised on amazing pepper gravy and biscuits. I would be at Dor-Stop all the time if they had the sausage gravy on demand.\n\nNote: This is not the norm and the waitress seemed to be having a bad day. The only problem I have ever really had was when one of the waitresses didn't put forth much effort. She never stopped by to fill our drinks. Asked for our order and that was it. Even though we were friendly and polite, we never received the same in return. I understand that people have bad days. The waitresses here are very nice, but they are human and have their off days. Like I said, this was only one time, and on a subsequent visit, she was much more cheery and friendly. Everyone is human.\n\nI would recommend that anyone in the area give this place a try for breakfast and lunch."
1,"I'm not ashamed to admit it - I was skeptical.  As a long-time lover of Pamela's, I just couldn't see this place making me happy when we discovered Pamela's in the Strip was closed on Memorial Day.  The wait was torturous at the Dor-Stop too...however, it was a holiday so I suppose i understand.  And when we did finally get seated, the AMAZING hot cakes, SUPERB hash browns, and perfectly cooked eggs really made my morning!\n\nI prefer my hot cakes to be thin and flat, and when I saw the ones here, I was unsure again.  But the taste will BLOW YOUR MIND.  I got the apple cinnamon ones - they are crispy yet fluffy with apples that taste very fresh and just the right amount of cinnamon.  I even enjoyed the butter as a sweet additive to a decadent treat!  The potatoes were also amazing - true lyonnaise style with crispy outsides, warm insides, and plenty of onions.  Eggs were standard fair, but overeasy is often executed poorly... so props for getting it exactly right.  Several of my friends also ordered different flavors of hot cakes and suggested the oatmeal ones are really not to be missed as well.\n\nDespite the long wait and weird waitress, we all LOVED our breakfast and I was full for hours after.  YUM!  Can't wait to go back!"
1,"BEST BREAKFAST I'VE EVER HAD!!! I had the Guy's Version of the Jumblot. My girlfriend had the chocolate chip banana pancakes. These were the best pancakes I've ever eaten. They have a texture and gooeyness that I've never had in a pancake. The Guy's Version was eggs, potatoes, jalape\u00f1os, tomato, cheddar, and hot sausage. The hot sausage had the most amazing flavor. \n\nEveryone should definitely make a trip here once! Pancakes are to die for!!"
1,Food here is absolutely wonderful! Service is good and people are better. Take my family there and am extremely satisfied.
1,"My sister and I both got the banana and chocolate chip hot cakes, and we loved them! Huge servings and you can also get the hot cakes with bacon, sausage, and ham for a slightly higher price. This was my second time going actually and if I could go every day I would! Highly recommend!"
1,Best pancakes in Pittsburgh besides DeLucas. Always delicious and the service is nice.
1,"I had the Italian jombot here it was so good, and the service was awesome!!! I will definitely be back."
1,"I have been to The Dor-Stop numerous times and never been disappointed. They are known for their pancakes as featured on The Food Network's \""Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.\"" \n\nI always get pancakes when I go and my favorites are banana walnut and pumpkin. These pancakes are thick and fluffy and so filling! I always end up taking at least one home. My husband has also tried their french toast which he highly recommends. \n\nThey get busy during the peak breakfast/brunch hours so a wait is sometimes necessary but they move fast with service without rushing you and you get out quick.  It has your basic diner feel. It is clean and service has always been warm and friendly. Prices are very reasonable in my opinion as my husband and I both eat for under $20. \n\nI love the Dor-stop and highly recommend it to others!"
1,"Ladies and Gentleman, welcome to pancake heaven. It was several years ago that I first came upon The Dor-Stop, and since then my breakfast lifestyle has been forever changed.\n\nI know this will sound like blasphemy coming from a Dor-Stop convert, but I hate pancakes. I just don't understand them, they are odd and moist, and nowhere near as delicious as waffles. I came into The Dor-Stop the first time with this mindset, and am now forever changed. \n\nThe Dor-Stop's hotcakes are delicious and almost cake-like. They aren't thin crepes, or undercooked globs of batter, but instead sweet, fluffy treats that come in a plethora of flavors. I personally endorse oatmeal walnut, but others love the banana or pumpkin (when in season). I recommend ordering the \""Egg Combo\"": 2 hot cakes, eggs, and bacon/sausage. Go all out, you deserve it. \n\nOn a recent visit, I also discovered the french toast menu, which has caused me to forsake my hot cake habit. The french toast is almost deep fried and covered in this raspberry yogurt. It is a can't miss item on the menu, rivaling that of the hot cake. When pumpkin french toast is a special on the menu, I suggest you run to The Dor-Stop and taste a little of heaven. \n\nI've also sampled various items from the lunch menu with no complaints. The Rachel and Ruben are especially tasty if you feel like bypassing the breakfast menu. \n\nThis place is truly heaven in Dor-Stop. Make sure you arrive early on a weekend morning to avoid the crowd! Or wake up at dawn on a weekday and partake (as I have been known to do from time to time!)"
1,I will never forget Campiti's. As a youngster growing up playing on Potomac Avenue and Dormont. My favorite pizza was and still is Campiti's. I have not found an equal in the 18 years I have been in CA. The hoagies were pretty damn good too.
1,"My husband and I have been coming here for the past six years and cannot say enough about the salon.  Prior to finding Geno Como, I could never get the correct looking highlights/lowlights until I found Lisa here (I'm 44!).  My hair has never looked so beautiful and I am so glad that we found such a great place.  Everyone is so friendly and I love coming here as the salon has a light and airy look to it which is very relaxing, yet the prices are very reasonable.  I have recommended more people to this salon and they are also very happy.  You cannot go wrong with Geno Como!!!"
1,I love this place. I live within walking distance and I find myself there a lot. Tons of beer choices (microbrews for you beer snobs) and great pizza & pub food.  It's a perfect pizza pub in every way. Try the hot lime flavored wings. They make your eyes well up when you put your face over them to smell the amazing wing aroma. Nice bartenders and wait staff as well.
1,"What a cool place! I have NO green thumb WHATSOEVER, but had passed by for about a year now since I moved to Dormont and had always thought the shop looked cute. Now was my chance as I needed a last minute Christmas present for my grandma. \n\nThe place is larger than you think from the outside. They actually have a whole outdoor area that's covered for the winter with many different plants I couldn't identify. I thought the owner was super duper sweet and just really energetic. Her and another staff member helped me pick out a plant that was in a vase, not in a pot, and looked really cool and modern. I loved it and had a fleeting thought to pick one up myself... if I wouldn't kill it (which I probably would!). \n\nI had commented about a table full of vases filled with what looked like works of art. They turned out to be flower displays for hotels, but man where they cool. If I was doing an event or having a wedding, that's exactly what I would have wanted. They just looked really modern but creative. \n\nThey also have some winged friends you can say hi to, including one screaming one in the back that you can't see. Kinda creepy, but I guess that comes with a unique shop! I will absolutely be back to pick up items for people and consider them for any events I have coming up."
1,"It would get 4 stars for the name alone.  The idea that they would just sell you hot dogs and six-packs is so just and pure it almost makes me want to weep.  \n\nI went here and had the bacon chili cheddar dog and one with relish, kraut, and brown mustard.  Both were excellent dogs, and their beer list is incredible.  \n\nAgain, how come we can't have this is Boston, where it comes off as real?  If they tried this in NYC or Boston, it would come off as a gimmick.  Whereas here, in Swissvale, it just seems like a neighborhood place with a twist.  A coronary twist.  So good....."
1,"Made my first trip to D's today.  By far one of the best bars I have been to.  Great atmosphere, good food for a bar, and how can I not mention the BEER CAVE.  They have an impeccable selection of brew.  Great place to go for a night out or just to have a good time.  I would imagine a Stiller game would be pretty fun to watch.  The prices are just right including drinks, but if only we could do something about the county drink tax.  \n\nI will visit this place frequently."
1,"Best beer selection and bar food I've ever had- anywhere. The Vienna Beef hot dogs are delicious and the Buffalo wings the best in the 'burgh. The kielbasa and fish sandwiches are solid, as is their pizza (I was skeptical- I thought, why not stick w/ just the hot dogs since they're perfect? but they're also very good.). Skip the chips- they taste burned. The fries are sooo good- get them with chili and cheese or pub style (cheese and bacon with homemade ranch to dip in)...  Yes if you eat this every day it will kill you, but if you're looking for the best bar food- this is it. If you're looking for the best beer selection- you can't find anything better. Good selection on tap and amazing variety in the beer cave (they say it's ~1000 different beers). Some say Sharp Edge has better on tap...but their food is terrible."
1,"This is probably my favorite bar in Pittsburgh.  The pizza is solid, the hot dogs are great, and the beer cave...mmmm.  My only complaint is that they haven't opened another one on the other side of town!"
1,Place was awesome.\n\nDelirium on tap.\n\nHot dogs with mac n cheese on them.
1,"Rupe Rankings of note:\n- #1: crave factor\n- #1: signature sandwich (hotdog)\n- #1: beer selection\n- #2: pizza\n- #2: fries\n\nMenu recommendations:\n- chili cheese dog\n- scorpassi (kielbasa with jalapenos)\n- garden pizza\n- plain fries\n- any brew you haven' t had or from blue point, ommegang or bell's\n\nWhy you would go:\n- 1000+ bottled beers on hand for on-premise consumption or customized 6-pack creation\n- 30-40 brews on tap for pints or take-away growlers\n- awesome pub food\n- miller lite for cheap (in the new fully-stocked upstairs bar)\n- roll-up doors on the restaurant side for quasi-outdoor seating\n\nWhy you wouldn't go:\n- with a larger group (more than 4 people)\n- seeking a quiet evening spot for kids (afternoons are fine for kids)\n- unwilling to pay the premium for micro / craft / import brews\n- unable to parallel park\n\nOverall impression:\nTerriffic neighborhood place for a small group to grab some terribly unhealthy food and try some new beers."
1,"This is our favorite neighborhood restaurant. They serve \""bar food\"", but there's a nice variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian food. My favorite items on the menu are the veggie dogs, pizza, and soft pretzels. \n\nYou can't beat their beer selection. Make sure to visit the beer cave while you are there and their section of take-out beer for an even larger selection."
1,"Everybody told me about this place when I said I was moving to Pittsburgh and, sure enough, it is awesome.  All the Belgian beer a girl could want.  And the wings.  And oh, the Mason Dixon dog."
1,"I go to D's almost every Wednesday night for a beer and a veggie dog after an hour of bouldering at the Wall.\n\nTheir beer selection changes often, and I've never been disappointed.  If I don't know what the beer is, they'll often bring over a sample to try to make sure I like it.\n\nThe veggie dogs are great, the cheese fries are great, and I've never had a problem with the service.   It can get crowded when a game is on, but just grab a beer and wait for a table.\n\nPros: Fun menu, great draft beer selection, beer cave!\nCons: Sometimes crowded and loud"
1,"Awesome. That is D's.\n\nBurgers, dogs, and fries are so done, right? Wrong. Excellent toppings, excellent food, excellent beer selection. The fries and vegetarian selections are well done, so no one feels left out.\n\nI didn't know about this place until I started getting into trying odd micro-brews and I was looking for some different beers I had while living abroad. The beer cave is an experience and you will not be letdown. I have yet to meet someone who feels that D's is anything less than stellar.\n\nSidenote: I highly recommend D's Sixpax for someone's 21st birthday to pick out a six-pack from their epic selection of brews. (Also, buy them a hot dog, cheapskate!)"
1,"Sometimes I get these intense cravings to stuff hot dogs and greasy french fries in my face. As someone who doesn't eat meat, the hot dog part of that is a rare occurrence. Thankful D's gives the option for veggie dogs. This makes me very happy. It also makes my hangovers happy too.\n\nNot to mention they have an absolutely spectacular selection of bottles and drafts. If I'm not here enjoying the little pleasures in life - such as fat, grease, and gluttony- I'm enjoying another sinful pleasure, booze. Every time I come here I'm overwhelmed with choices. \n\nThis place is magical."
1,Beer cave!!
1,"D's looks unassuming, but it's really over the top. Sure, they have fries, but why not order fries with bacon and cheese on them, plus ranch dressing on the side (You should, by the way - those are the pub fries and they are delicious). You could order a plain hot dog, but why do that when you have a choice of five different kinds of frank, and toppings like the Chihuahua: avocado, salsa, cheese and jalapeno? Plus, your dog (even if it's a turkey dog like mine) might arrive at the table with a little char on it; that to me is the peak of hot dog flavor.\n\nI feel like a restaurant that serves cheese sauce like a food group should have a warning label on the door, but with their sense of humor, the label would say \""Warning: the food inside is damn delicious and best consumed with a great beer.\"""
1,D's is just one of those places I love going to. I can't get enough of picking out my own 6 pack of wonderfulness. All amazing beer. The food has never let me down. The service has always been good. This place is just awesome.
1,"I don't come here to eat much, I usually come for the beer cave. Best build-your-own six pack joint in the city!"
1,"Was in town for a recent sporting event and read good things about Ds. A bit off the beaten path, but an easy bus ride from my Oakland hotel (and bus originates from Downtown, so should be easy ride from there, too).\n\nDs did not disappoint: creative craft beer list of 25+ taps, plus hundreds of bottles in the Beer Cave that you can have onsite or take to-go, and some of the best dogs I've ever had. Was there on a Friday, so got the Scorpion (cheddar jalapeno kielbasi) & fries deal for $5.50--excellent. Also tried the very good Ds Brat (cheesy bratwurst) & fries (same price), and they do a terrific version of the Chicago Dog. There are also 20+ toppings options if you want to DIY. Nice, friendly service from the guys behind the bar/in the kitchen made this a fine time.\n\nNext time I'm in PGH, Ds will be at the top of my list to visit. Can't wait to try their other dogs and whatever they have on tap (or in the Cave).\n\nP.S. There is also sit-down service in a room between the bar and Cave that seemed more family-friendly. I noticed several tables had pizzas and burgers, so I assume those are decent, too."
1,Employees are awesome. Everyone is super friendly and they always have kick ass old school jams playing!
1,"D'z is hands down my favorite go to spot for good eats. I love their wings and their hot dogs. \nEverytime I go there i am greeted with fun young employees ready to serve or offer suggestions about their latest brews. Their draft list changes constantly so there's no sense in trying to remember which beer you had there the week before. Plus their beer cave is great with hundreds of different bottles to choose from all listed by the region from which they came. They also have a small cooler with about 150 different varieties of beer that are already chilled for your liking. Even if you get a warm beer, they have this ice cold dunk tank to put your bottle in that gets it nice and chilly for you in just a few minutes. That by far is my favorite aspect of D'z. If you choose to take beer home with you they also have a discount of $1.00 per bottle of every beer you take with you(excluding the pre-made six packs). So sometimes we get a six pack of variety beers at a lower cost than paying for them individually. On to the food:\n\nI love their wings and hot dogs and my masterful veggie burger creation. We always order the BBQ sauce because it taste so gooooood and their wings are nice and crispy and hot and smothered in plenty of sauce that you will be licking your fingers. We've tried almost all their dogs expect 2 and my favorite is the mac and cheese dog(w/ ketchup) and the chihuahua dog which is avocado, shredded cheddar cheese and jalapenos, my fiance enjoys a classic Chicago dog. The have delicious sauerkraut that i enjoy as well so i usually get a side for only 99 cents. Can't beat that price. Now when it comes to the veggie burger i love the way it taste. I do it up real nice by getting that black n blue topping which is blue cheese and cajun seasoning. I add bacon, onion, mushrooms, avocado, tomato, lettuce and their spicy mayo/double dip sauce. It is hands down the best burger i've ordered in a loooong time. \n\nIf your looking for a fun hangout spot for you and your buddies or even a tasty treat for the kids then D'z is where it's at!!! It gives you the feeling of just a fun place to be on the weekend or even the weekdays. \n\nDue to an unfortunate circumstance of eating at a different hotdog shop during restaurant week, my fiance would have proposed to me at D'z. We truly regret not waiting to go here but time was of the essence. D'z you truly are my favorite spot to be any day at any time and you will always be the place i wish i would have been proposed to at!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Went here after a run in nearby Frick Park, which I felt gave me license to have a (delicious) hot dog washed down with a few great beers. I can't wait to return!"
1,"Was at D's this afternoon! I was so excited to find real vienna Hot Dogs in Pittsburgh since I am a born and raised Chicago guy. They were good dogs, had mine Chicago Style of course! Not sure it was Pollmans Mustard. It the buns had poppy seeds! A great place with plenty of atmosphere!"
1,"D's is one of our favorite places in Pittsburgh. It's nice to have an easy, fun, casual place to get some good eats and a nice beer. As a vegetarian who still likes to pretend to eat meat, I so appreciate their multiple veggie options. Nearly any item on the menu can be made in a vegetarian version. Their special dogs (dog of the month) are usually a lot of fun. My favorite was the Thanksgiving dog back in November, with corn, mashed potatoes, cranberry, and stuffing. It was amazing! I came twice to have one in November. \n\nTheir beer list has to be the best I've seen in the city. Lots of great stuff on tap and a huge bottle room. \n\nSince we like to bring our toddler to dine with us, I'm always so happy that they are so friendly and accommodating with kids. He loves their mac and cheese and grilled cheese sandwiches, though I think he likes their crayons more.\n\nFor a fun family dinner, a good beer, watching a game, getting together with friends, or just experimenting with a new Belgian brew, I strongly recommend D's."
1,Mac n cheese dog is incredible.  This place is small and gets packed so be prepared for a long wait and no personal space.
1,"I absolutely loved this place. First off, I love Regent Square. It's the cutest place, and this is the perfect place for a night out or even to get beer for a night in. My boyfriend is obsessed with the create your own six pack from the beer cave. We ate here on a friday and the place was packed but we got sat right away and our food came out fast. Amazing specialty hummus of the day ( i think it was chipotle ranch) and great sandwiches. The portions are huge and you won't leave hungry."
1,"I love D's! My roommate and I are happy regulars at both the restaurant and the attached beer cave, and we like to drag our out-of-town friends here as well. This place is honestly one of the best things about living in Regent Square. The staff are friendly and efficient and the food is always hot and fresh. The beer is of course outstanding. What more could you want in a neighborhood bar?"
1,"I haven't actually been to the Regent Square location of Ambience, so this is more directed towards the Oakmont store.\n\nI love this place. I love it. It's gorgeous, high-quality [sometimes designer!] clothing that's so cheap it's ludicrous. And! All the profits go to a women's shelter! What more can you ask of a consignment shop?\n\nI daresay nothing. Go, shop, support."
1,"I don't know why you would go anywhere else. The fellow who runs this shop is what I think of as a traditional businessman. He's got a trade, is well known in the neighborhood, and asks a fair price. He does darn good work, too!\n\nI've gotten various shoes repaired over the last decade or so here, from leather to suede with lots of random requests in between. I think he may have even done my tap shoes way back when. One pair in particular he re-soled them 3 times. Man, I loved those shoes ... Anywho, the last time I had him patch the toes of my UGG boots (Don't judge. They are so comfy.) he charged me so little that I left him a big 'ole tip. \n\nBottom line: nice guy, great service. Support local business!"
1,I brought a shoe here that needed re-glued and it was done the next day and was so cheap.  The store owner was very friendly.  Would definitely do business here again.
1,"Amazing...\n\nThe owner of this establishment is honest, fair and skilled.  I have a pair of leather boots that I had reconditioned at this establishment.  My boots went from bad to great.  Total cost, $7!  \n\n$7 \n\nInsane value.  Great place.  I am so pleased places like this exist."
1,"THE best cheesesteaks, freshest buns, there is nothing bad here!!"
1,"Think fresh bread, fresh vegetables, daily sliced meats of the highest caliber served in white butcher paper by very slow service.  Ahhhh, the joys of ordering a torpedo (around six inches of bread) or a Battleship (fasten the hatches!) from the Triangle.  They make the best cold hoagies -- turkey, italian, and ham are among my favorites!  They also have a bar and TV's for that minimalist game viewing adventure with regulars from nearby homestead and braddock propping up the stools.  It's a great take out place -- call ahead though.  A Pittsburgh classic you must try once for a Steeler or Penguin game party.  Terrific!"
1,"Just go here, and order a battleship. If Kris makes it, its even better!"
1,"After 17 years of only being able to choose between three pizza chains, I really appreciate little places like this with good pizza.  The pepperoni pizzas are thin and greasy like they're supposed to be, the crust is home made, the sauce is good, and the amount of cheese perfect.\n\nIt's kind of sad that the other 'V' pizza place around the corner isn't any better than the three national chains."
1,Great pizza. Grandma's pie is an all time favorite!
1,"Best Wendy's experience I've ever had! And I wouldn't normally take the time to review fast food. We went just after midnight following a long and tiring day of moving. The idea was to hit up the Eat'N'Park over by Giant Eagle, but alas, they were closed.\n\nWe pulled into the drive thru, and were immediately greeted. Needed a minute to figure out the order and they waited patiently. Also made sure we were okay with waiting 6 minutes for the 3 chicken sandwiches we ordered, which we were. We pulled up and there were 3 young men working the window. They were moving quickly, smiling, and paying attention to what they were doing. We got our drinks and paid, and then I asked if I should move up since we were waiting and there were other cars behind us.\n\nWe waited about 3 minutes when one of the guys comes out and literally FLOURISHES our 3 bags of food at us. I mean, presentation AND style? At a fast food drive-thru at midnight? So cool. He was funny, attentive, and totally made our night. I don't even LIKE Wendy's that much, but I will definitely be back, and soon."
1,I like this place it provides a great atmosphere and can handle big groups. They also send you a coupon for a free dinner on your birthday and can use it anytime during your birthday month.  I would recommend making a reservation as they are normally busy and it takes awhile to eat. But this is a great place to go for a special occasion.
1,The atmosphere was fun. Our chef was very nice and entertaining. The filet was excellent.  Their salad dressing is a little harsh for my taste.  Over all it was a great time. I will definitely go back.
1,Benihana is by far our favorite steak and seafood place in the area. The food is so fresh. The chefs are great. The wait staff is excellent.  If you're looking for shrimp flying and loud chefs singing obnoxious songs then this is not for you. If you want a friendly  atmosphere and delicious food then this is your place. \nThe sushi is fresh and tasty. The quality of food is obviously there.
1,Love their spicy black bean dip and their black bean and pineapple quesadilla... mmmm can't get enough of their black bean.
1,Always great service at the bar from Tanya and Nikki. Great food and wide selection of draft beers. One of my favorite spots.
1,"This Starbucks is right down the street from my parents house. It's gotta be my favourite location in the Pittsburgh area. I read Joe D's review and laughed a bit. He's right...there are some guys who sit in there, but have you ever said hello? Have you ever asked them if you could sit down? They're totally nice guys! The baristas here are really efficient (most of the time) and super friendly. They're on top of their game and even remember regular's drink orders."
1,"I've been coming here ever since I can remember. The Baristas seem genuinely interested in your well-being. They all have great personalities and are a joy to talk to when I come in. Dan, while appearing super intimidating (spiky black hair, wears leather jackets and stuff) is extremely nice. I went away for college and when I came back he asked me all about it. Becky always remembers my orders and Astrid makes my iced coffee just right. I could sit in there for hours and I often do."
1,"I know a lot of people tend to either love or hate Panera; I happen to love it - the You-Pick-2 combo is one of my favorite lunch options. And as luck (good or bad depending on how my diet's going!) would have it, this location provides a daily opportunity to get one of those combos! This location is incredibly convenient for me - both for being relatively close to where I live and for being next to an old bookstore, clothes store, and a few other businesses - and has earned all 5 stars for being a bit better than the average Panera. \n\nOne, I've never walked in here and found a shortage in sweet treats, which is a common problem if I want an afternoon bagel in a lot of other Panera locations. Two, the sandwiches here just taste fresher than a lot of other places I've been to. Three, as others have mentioned, the staff are just nicer here - I have no idea why, but I'm not complaining! Bonus star for this Panera because it's actually made its entire interior comfortable and encourages people to relax and use its wi-fi, which is something I can't say a lot of other locations have nailed just yet."
1,Great old-school donut shop with delicious donuts.  The even still tie up the boxes.
1,"HOLY MOTHER OF DONUTS! This place is amazing. My daughter and I stop every Friday morning, and honestly, it's the highlight of my whole week. Donut holes are to die for, but everything here is good. Like other reviewers said, get here early because they go fast!"
1,"The old fashioned sour cream... bavarian filled... glazed and cake... OMG so good. Seriously, all of them! This little shop is right in the middle of a neighborhood. I can only imagine the temptations of living so close to the intoxicating smells that waft out of there each morning. \n\nWe got there about 5 minutes before 7, thinking they would open at 7. There were already 3 people in line. The doors finally opened up about 10 minutes after 7, I guess you can't rush something so wonderful. A dozen tasty gems were carefully chosen... better give us a dozen doughnut holes too! Every last bite was terrific. \n\nPittsburg, I hope you realize how lucky you are!"
1,"The barista was super sweet. I told her I wanted something new and she was a fountain of information. She made a lot of great suggestions and I told her to wing it. She went with a Caramel Brulee with two pumps of White Mocha. She also gave me a discount, which was awesome.\n\nI used an AirCard on the netbook and sat in Starbucks from 11am-2:30pm. I had headphones on and just zoned out. I was comfortable and wasn't disrupted at all.\n\nIt seemed to get busy from 1pm-2pm so if you want to stop at this location, make sure to get there earlier so you can grab a seat."
1,"This is the first place in Pittsburgh that has gotten my hair right. They were courteous, up front about their pricing structure, the location extremely convenient. The elevator up is a little sketchy, but the inside the salon is lovely. I am scheduling my second appointment right now!"
1,"Very, very pleased with the service I get at MCN. I've been a customer for several years. Sara K does my hair and she's so good. She puts up with my craziness (we did purple for awhile) but also is fine when I go back to just my brunette self. I love the stylists, they're very friendly, and I find the price to be comparable with other high-end salons. The atmosphere is trendy and hip and the salon is always clean. The owner is super-friendly and is usually working. \n\nHighly recommended!\n\nThank you!"
1,"1st time here. Got my hair did tonight! I'm an oxymoron I work in cosmetics, do professional makeup and skincare, have access to all the wonderful anti aging lasers, injectibles, botox, fat melting machines, but then I hate wearing makeup, getting procedures done, and let my hair grow out without a visit to the salon that is long overdo. I'm still that little tomboy climbing trees, I guess. Low maintenance by weekday, then I bust out the fabulous by night. \n\nThe point being that I had let my hair go for quite awhile and the groupon just came out yesterday after I had made my much needed appointment! Already scheduled, groupon the day before my appointment, and I got a great haircut! Triple score! Plus they have pets hanging out! Quadruple SCORE! Places where you can bring a pet to work are super cool, I like the laid back implication for the business. \n\nHeather was my stylist and we hit it off amazingly, I gave her advice about skin treatments that would be right for her and she explained what kind of cut would be best for me. I asked about extensions because I have been curious to try them but she said the clip on ones would be better for my hair type. I appreciate that she gave me the truth straight up. I don't want my hair getting damaged after the things I have done to it! She gave me a modern chick look that I love, I can have a soft wavy romantic look, or I can straighten it and pull out the chunkiness for an edgier look. Thanks Heather, it's so easy and manageable. Prices seem pretty standard for this type of place around $45-55 per haircut. Can't wait to see what we do next!"
1,"Being new to the city, I went into panic about finding a new hair stylist. SF and Boston have plenty of reviews to choose from but Pittsburgh didn't have many, let alone stellar reviews on salons. At the time I colored my hair so I didn't want to let just anyone put foils and scissors near my head. Finding a new hairstylist is like a game of russian roulette to me. I can either be safe or be really screwed for a few weeks.\n\nMCN was really the only salon ranked high in a search in my neighborhood so I gambled and scheduled an appointment with Sara. The salon is located near a Whole Foods, Starbucks, Walgreens and what use to be a Borders. It is clean, spacious and open with nice views overlooking the city.\n\nSara did a great job and continues to do so (I'm loyal like that). She consults me first and doesn't deviate from what we agree upon. Her demeanor is professional and friendly. While I was waiting for my color to process, MCN has some outlets for you to plug in your computer to pass the time.\n\nReasonably priced and another nice thing is that MCN occasionally will give free goodies as a thank you or for the holidays. While certainly the do is most important, the little things count as well. I will say though that they do seem a little pushy with product and the product may not even be the best one for your hair. I know salons can make a great profit off of product from the show Tabitha's Salon but this can ruin your experience at MCN after an awesome haircut/color treatment."
1,"First haircut in pittsburgh, and absolutely one of my favorite cut!  I had heather, one of the senior stylist, and completely adored her. She was very personable and had constructive advice on my hairstyle.  She definitely was able to come up with the perfect style to frame my face just by listening to what I wanted.  A picture wasn't even necessary. Definitely would recommend her.  Also the salon is beautiful with a gorgeous view.  Staff was super friendly."
1,"so i went here to be a hair model for a coloring class and was so impressed! my stylist, margeaux, was friendly, knowledgable, and talented. once i was seated in the chair, she offered me water and as i was getting my hair colored, another stylist offered me a brownie (who can turn that down?!). we talked about what color i wanted to go and the process began. margeaux was quick and efficient and the hair washing (always my favorite part) felt amazing! she blow dried my hair and i finally got to see the finished product which i was very happy with.\ni'll definately be back, and requesting margeaux, although i got to see the other models' finished hair as well, and i'm pretty sure every stylist there was super talented."
1,"I have been going to MCN salon for over 3 years now.  Since moving to the east end in 2008, I went to many salons and barbers trying to find a stylist that listened and responded with great technique.  Kara Hudson is that person.  She has been at MCN for quite some time.  Not only is she friendly, but she stays on task and always listens to new styles that I want to try.  I consider our monthly (or 6 week) visits a highlight.  Recently, as I am involved with philanthropic efforts in Pittsburgh, Kara donated services and product for an event I was promoting.  Now someone (a winner from the event I hosted) has the opportunity to experience Kara.  Win/Win all around.  Thanks Kara and the staff (front end, shampoo gals, owners) for always making me feel like family each time I come.  I will actually be there tonight!  #countingDOWN"
1,"I've been going to MCN salon for a few years now, and I have to say that it is truly the most fabulous salon in Pittsburgh!  The decor is gorgeous and gives off a spa like tranquility with a hip vibe.  The level of service is high from beginning to end.  My stylist is Margeaux, and if you're looking for gorgeous hair - go to her!!! She really takes her time to listen to what you're asking for and makes sure that your hair is styled to perfection before you leave.  I recently decided to cut off my long hair to donate to Locks of Love.  While I'm used to having long hair, she gave me a really cute cut and showed me how to style it at home (though I'm nowhere near as good at doing it as she is).  If you're looking for a great salon experience and amazing hair, go see Margeaux at MCN Salon."
1,"Ok so after coming here since March I finally feel ready to review. \n\nI started coming to MCN after I had my hair colored and cut by someone who absolutely destroyed my hair. I had asked for an ombr\u00e9 and ended up with a poop brown and bleach blonde wreck. The next morning I called MCN praying they could fit me on for a corrective color. They got me in with Leslee that afternoon.  \n\nI have linked some pictures but I don't know if they do her work justice. I went from having patches of bleached hair to the long ombr\u00e9 that I'd hoped for. Leslee spent hours on my hair color. It involved dying the roots the correct color, bleaching my end pieces blonde, and then toning the blonde from crazy yellow bleached to golden. \n\nShe took my hacked long layers and blended them while leaving as much length as possible. I was already overwhelmed with the change in color I was so glad she was able to salvage my length. \n\nI left that day with the hair cut and color I wanted in the first place and I was so so grateful! I've been going to Leslee since and I think she does an amazing job. Last time I saw her I ended up ditching the ombr\u00e9 and going to a \""fall\"" color. I wanted deeper brown with red. It's literally exactly what I asked for. \n\nI've also gotten an up-do for an event. I've never gotten so many compliments. And my long, heavy, thick hair stayed up all night. I've never had an up-do last as well. \n\nThe salon is beautiful. The staff is helpful. And Leslee is the best! I highly  recommend MCN and Leslee. 2 co-workers of mine now go to her and they are both very happy as well!"
1,"I really like SoHo.  First off, it's located on the north shore and close to everything.  Nice bar, friendly staff, sleek and modern.  Great place to watch a game, LCD screens everywhere.  Skip the other appetizers and start with the angry shrimp.  They do a really good job with a filet mignon.  The salmon picata looked yummy, but since it wasn't mine, I didn't get to taste it.  If you don't want a big meal, they have all the usual sandwiches and burgers.  For dessert, have the banana bread pudding or some yummy chocolate fudge cake!  Or, if you're not feeling fancy, just throw back a few beers and bacon cheddar burger.  It's that kind of place, too."
1,"LUNCH:  This was one of my favorite lunch spots when I lived and worked in Pittsburgh. I was a creature of habit though - - for lunch I very seldom strayed from their wonderful lobster bisque and a nice mixed green salad. It was the perfect lunch. Served quickly, which gave me plenty of time for the nice walk to and from work.\n\nDINNER: For dinner, when I had more time, it was always nice to venture into one of their other great seafood offerings. They have a couple of great salmon dishes that I really like and a striped bass. All seafood is fresh and prepared with care. Chicken and steak, but I never tried them - -  too many good seafood choices. Very nice presentations.\n\nSUSHI: They have an extensive sushi menu - for those of you who are big sushi fans. Me?  Not so. But I have friends who are and they rave about the sushi here. \n\nOne of the things I like best about this place is that the menu includes info on where your dinner was born, raised and caught.\n\nSUSTAINABLE FISHES\nThey exclusively serve Lummi Island Salmon\nhttp://www.lummiislandwild.com \n\nTilapia, NC\nLouisiana Catfish, LA\nAtlantic Salmon\nRainbow Trout, ID \n \nWILD LINE CAUGHT FISH\nDayboat Fluke, NJ\nLummi Island Salmon, BC \nTombo, HI\nWaluu, HI\nShutome Swordfish, HI\nStriped Bass, NJ\nPintado, Brasil \nChilean Sea bass\n#1 Ahi Tuna, HI\nMahi Mahi, C.R.\nWild Sea Scallops, MA\nDiver Scallops, Baja \n7 oz. Lobster Tail, SA\n \nFor an inland seafood restaurant this one rivals many costal ones I've eaten at. Definitely an upscale, pleasant place to eat lunch or dinner. Great service, quiet relaxed atmosphere. \n\nYes, it is a little pricey. If you want cheap fried seafood, head on over to Long John Silvers or Captain D's. But I bet you can't get them to tell you where their seafood came from . . . even if they know!  And, even if they do, you probably don't want to know!\n\nYou get what you pay for - in both food & service."
1,"Was a little hesitant to eat here because of the average to below average reviews. But it was in our hotel and we were famished.\n\nBut we were pleasantly surprised by our meals that were extremely delicious. I got the Waluu/Butterfish (highly recommend this, although it was a special) and the wife got the corn-meal crusted wall-eye (the bacon whipped mash potatoes were awesome). The service was prompt and on point. For dessert, the creme brulee and cheesecake (with fruit compote) was fantastic as well. The sushi appetizer I got was good (as good as sushi can be) and the Blue Crab soup/bisque got rave reviews from my wife.\n\nTo boot, since we were going to go see a show at the Benedum, we got 15% off by showing our tickets! \n\nIf I had to nitpick a con about our experience was that the wine we got (Raimat Chard and some california Riesling) was underwhelming. \n\nWe look forward to coming back again."
1,High end seafood attached to a high end hotel. I liked the large bar area where I had lunch. Tried the fish (Cod) sandwich that was fresh and high quality. Great service too. I would return again when in town for any reason.
1,"We had our reception at The Pennsylvanian in Pittsburgh. Opening Night Caterers was our first choice and we were not disappointed!! From the first meeting, to the wonderful tasting, to the preparation and set up, to the big day, we could not have been more pleased with the service or the food. Everyone raved about it being the best wedding food ever! And the cake!! Delicious and beautiful. I would highly recommend to anyone!"
1,"I was driving on a road trip from Ohio to Virginia and my parking brake light turned on while I was on the highway, so I figured it would be safest to pull of the road and have it checked out before I kept driving; this one happened to be the first one off the exit. Lu was quite the character: friendly and knowledgeable and Mike and the other guys were very friendly as well.  Lu got us in and out. He saw that the brake fluid was low and added some fluid for free and then put my car up on the lift and inspected the brakes just to make sure.  I was back on the road in no time and I'm so grateful for their friendly and fast service.  Seriously, these guys were great. Lu also took the time to describe and show me exactly what was going on with my car and so I felt safe hitting the road.  The problem was fixed and I appreciated their help so much, I got to my destination and created a Yelp account just so I could let everyone know what a great group of guys work there.  Thanks!"
1,"A beautiful little bar with an exciting \""martini\"" list - do step outside your comfort zone and try one of the crafted drinks."
1,My family and I went to Olive or Twist before a Pirate Game. The food was delicious! I had the crab cake sandwich. The happy hour specials were also a plus. I had a cake batter martini which was tasty! The location is also convenient for anyone going to a game. We walked over Roberto Clemente bridge and were right there. We will definitely be going back! Great work Olive or Twist!
1,"Always a good spot if you are craving a martini. As per the waitress recommendation, I ordered a pear martini and my husband had a Moscow mule. Both were delicious without being sweet. \n\nSome might find the dinner selection limited but I think it allows for the restaurant to highlight some great dishes. My husband had the Tuscan steak sandwich and he could not stop raving about it. He loved the pretzel roll that it was served on. I went a little more traditional and ordered a burger but it was a perfectly cooked burger. \n\nThis is not our first time stopping at Olive or twist and it will not be our last!"
1,"$3.00 fresh baked Italian loaf, need I say more.  The Italian bread is so yummy and makes great bruschetta.  They bake their bread fresh daily and do not include any preservative so eat it quick!"
1,"My heart is still trying to get back into regular running mode.. The portions from this place are insane.  Food is delicious, decor looks like a dirty truck stop.  \n\nThe omelets are INSANE, bigger than my head.. speaking of things bigger than my head.. the Sausage patties are in fact that large.  \n\nService is what you'd expect, pretty good for an overworked crew."
1,"This review is for both the particular location that I used back on September 23rd, 2012 and for Avis' customer service on their 800 number just now.\n\nI had arrived to Pittsburgh at 6am via bus from NYC and had several options for renting a car (see photo). Avis turned out to be the best deal on top of being located in an easy-to-find location (in addition to being easy to return the car).\n\nI was aware of a 29-minute grace period before being charged another day (or hour). The clock/timer on the parking garage entrance was 6 minutes fast, and me being me, this mattered. It said I returned at 8:47 even though my cell phone showed 8:41am. I immediately took a photo, intending to use this in case I were to be overcharged, even though the location doesn't open for business until 9am and wouldn't be able to rent the car out to anyone for another ~20 minutes anyway.\n\nI was back in Pittsburgh on October 9th and made it a special point to get back to the place so I could resolve the situation in person. It turned out that it's hard for the particular store location to make adjustments if it's been more than a few days. The guy there, Francis, said it's not a huge deal to make the adjustment but that it's out of his control and that if I call the 800 number, it should be fine.\n\nPause for ~6 months.\n\nSo yeah, today I finally made time to pick up the papers and phone and make a call. They first said I returned the car late and then after I explained the situation and offered to send the photo I took that demonstrates the clock discrepancy, they gave me a 'one-time courtesy' and I'm now ~75 dollars richer. Or less poor. Your call."
1,"You know how you say, \""I want a big change!\"" but then you get in the stylist's chair and you're like, \""I'm looking for a change, but only take about an inch off,\"" and then you still want to cry when you leave the salon bc you're hair is too short?\n\nI lost 4 inches of hair and got bangs and I only wanted to cry a little bit, when she made the first snip!  I freaking loved my hair.  LOVED.MY.HAIR.  Bangs! \n\nBangs!  And not the kind that you thought would make you look like Zooey Deschanel but instead you look like you are 10 and your mom got your hair cut at Fantastic Sams and never, ever, ever lay right!\n\nBangs!  Like long, sweeping bangs that fell right and made all my friends say, \""I wish I could pull of bangs!\""\n\nI LOVE THIS PLACE.  They moved to Lawrenceville a few years ago, and I havent been to the new salon yet bc its been that long since I've had my haircut which is so sad.  It's like witch craft, what they do with hair, and I need some magic.\n\nI highly recommend this salon."
1,"God I miss this place. Best sandwiches in the Burgh. If you are down near the Strip, you have got to swing by here. Get the pastrami or roast beef and do not ask for the slaw or fries on the side. It's all on there for a purpose and it is a gloriously messy sandwich."
1,"Whenever I happen to be in Pittsburgh, I would come by to this great place for lunch.\n\nThe sandwiches are HOT! Whether it is steak & cheese, or fish & cheese, or even hot sausages and cheese, man, it is ALL good. With literally a pile of tasty french fries and sauerkraut like cold slaw in the middle, the sandwich is huge, all for under $6. Add a local Yuengling beer (America's oldest and best brewery) if you like.\n\nIf the sandwich is too much for you to handle, take a stroll at the tri-state park.\n\nThe place is usually very busy at lunch time, with waitresses hustling around, wearing store T-shirt knotted around the waist, dashing in and out (since they do have outdoor tables). On the back of their T's, there is a vivid picture of the gigantic sandwich. When they turn around, you just cannot help notice their boobs too. I guess the sandwiches are as attractive as nice boobs :-)\n\nA drooling place. Period."
1,"If ewe don like Primanti's, yer a jag-off.\n\nAs much a Pittsburgh institution as the Stillers, Irn City, and Sophie Masloff.  Much like referring to Kleenex, to native yinzers, you just go and get a Primanti's.  No need for any further descriptives.  \n\nThe secret to the sandwich is the bread: thickly sliced Mancini's bread.  Rumor has it that Primanti's opened a location in Florida.  It didn't do very well because they weren't able to get the Mancini's.  There you go.  My favorite version of the Primanti's is the steak and cheese.  It's a beef patty and cheese (not sliced beef as in a cheese steak).  This is the only thing I will eat tabasco on.  Fresh, thick cut fries and mild vinegar based cole slaw.  Piled up perfection.\n\nOnly visit the Strip District location for the full effect.  The other locations pale in comparison."
1,I am still trying to figure out how to transport a few sandwiches back on the plane.....There is just something about Pittsburgh and their traditional comfort food!  I have addicted my husband.
1,"So had a short stop at pittsburgh before heading out to the airport and decided to go on a food adventure...  After getting lost and going to the closed location, I finally found this one at market square.  I paid for parking and boy was it worth it!\n\nThe classic pastrami is too good! Crisped edges and stacked with vinegary slaw and crisp homey fries!  Lived up to the hype! Trip was worth it."
1,"When there's this much hype about a place, it's hard to live up to, but they did a pretty damn good job. Maybe not the best sandwich I've ever had in my life, but if it was any random sandwich shop I'd happened to stumble into, it would definitely be five stars without a second thought.\n\nThe chili cheese fries were among the best I've ever had. I don't know what they do to them - it's not the chili that's particularly great, it's not the cheese that's particularly great, and it's not the fries that are particularly great. But somehow, putting them all together just turns it into unbeatable awesome.\n\nThe sandwich itself (I got the corned beef) was very good despite the fact that I hate coleslaw. But they don't mean the typical mayo-and-carrot-and-purple-onion coleslaw; they make it with vinegar and oil, so it's basically just like seasoned lettuce. They put a bit much of it on, which overwhelmed the rest of the ingredients at first, but just pull about half of the slaw off and you have a kick-ass sandwich. The hot sauce goes really well on it too. And for a pretty reasonable price, I might add. Normally, I'd expect it to be about twice as much with that kind of reputation and downtown location."
1,"Ok, ok, ok, y'all need to calm down.  Quit with the 'it's too small,' 'it's a Pittsburgh thing,' and 'it's so greasy' statements.  That's what Primanti's IS.  It's a compact, greasy Pittsburgh right.  \n\nYes, the place is small, it is in Market Square, and will remain there, wouldn't you be disappointed if one day you wanted Primanti's and no more Market Square location?  I know I would.  If I were in the downtown region and had that craving I wouldn't want to have to work my way up to the Strip just for a bite of that Pittsburgh goodness.  \n\nThe 'it's a Pittsburgh' thing comments baffle me.  If you have food shows featuring the sandwich, magazines writing about it, and it's considered the 'Manliest Restaurant in America,'  I think that means it's more than just a Pittsburgh thing.  Why else would Primanti's be featured on such media?  Why else would these people centered around shows and magazines venture to a Primanti's?  I mean that has to show you it's more than just a Pittsburgh thing.\n\nAnd 'it's so greasy?'  Did you not watch them makes your sandwich, which you picked from their extensive menu, on the griddle in front of you?  Expect it to be greasy, they are frying it for you and melting that cheese on it.  Maybe don't even pay attention to the greasy factor, especially with that crunchy coleslaw and heap of fries placed between those two thick slices of Italian bread.  \n\nBetter yet, move out of my way, I'm about to chow down on that Pittsburgh grease fest awaiting my attention."
1,"it's been close to 5 years since i've had primanti's, but after being disgusted by a knock off in chicago (i'm talking about you Lucky's).. i had to come back to give props to primanti's.\n\ni don't remember what i ordered, but do remember ordering two sandwiches only to come back 4 hours later to order another.  i do remember the monstrosity of the sandwich w/o skimping out on the meats and w/ a good ratio of meats, fries, and slaw."
1,"Just writing a review makes my mouth water. I've only been once but I got one of the well-known pastrami sandwiches loaded with fries and cole slaw. It's huge, and if you're a snobby chick that refuses to eat like a man then don't even bother visiting. This place is seriously cool and it's featured on the Food Network, which is a big deal to a food dork like me."
1,"Primanti bros has the best corned beef sandwich in the east, and the coleslaw, fries and tomato right on the sandwich made it totally unique. Oh and they also have a great craft beer selection."
1,"First time going...and I LOVED IT! Great service, tasty food, and a \""hometown\"" ambiance. I'm not from Pittsburgh, but this place definitely made me feel at home. The portions are huge! My only regret is that I didn't try to split a meal w/ my girlfriend."
1,"I ate a taco here in the snow. IN THE SNOW! I've eaten a taco here sweating my bum off. I\""ve eaten a taco standing up because there's no tables. This taco stand is so amazing that I'll pretty much eat a taco here during a hurricane....if those happened in western PA! \n\nDoes this not show my true devotion to these tasty little taco's! Ok, I lied. I like them so much I just do it up big and get a burrito. It's just a magic mixture of rice, cheese, salsa and lots and lots of lime. I'm into the shrimp burrito because i love me some shrimp. But really, any type of meat or a veggie choice is going to be awesome. Plus they are cheap cheap cheap! \n\nDo me a favor and stop by this stand while you're out shopping in the strip, you will not regret it. Rain, snow or sunshine!"
1,Just moved out to Pittsburgh from San Diego and I was so shocked to find they serve Carne Asada here. This shop is a life saver when I want to have some authentic mexican food.
1,"Where to begin, where to begin...\n\nMore often than not, I find myself staring at my computer screen thinking about how I am going to blast an esablishment. I don't rave about \""good\"" food. I rave about amazing food. The type of food that I have dreams about. The type of food that makes me want to bring about a thousand dollars cash and gorge myself untill I need an ambulance.\n\nThe taco stand outside of Reyna Foods makes just that kind of food. Too often when we think of Mexican food, we think of a variety samey tasting, samey textured mixtures of ground beef, yellow cheese, beans, and tomatoes stuffed into a processed flour tortilla covered with a plastic sauce (I'm looking at you Emiliano's). Reyna's doesn't just break the mold, they hurl it at the wall, smash the pieces with a bat and then scatter the dust in a blast furnace. The tacos here are aboslutely amazing. Fresh ingredients cooked right there on an old plancha-style grill that has absorbed the flavors of countless meals and stuffed into fresh corn tortillas are a truly enlightening experience. I mean it. \n\nThe first time I went here was to just grab a quick snack while walking around in the Strip district. I saw they offered tongue as a protein choice and thought to myself \""What the hell, in for a dime in for a dollar right?\"" Best. Choice. Ever. The first bite was like reaching the Seventh Level of Enlightenment. The Buddha said I could ask one question. After careful consideration I asked, \""Can I have another taco?\"" After that I made a vow that I would forever be a loyal raving fan.\n\nThe tacos are assembled to your liking. I like mine with the works: the perfectly cooked meat on the warm tortilla then covered with queso fresco, tomatoes, lettuce, onion, cilantro, fresh lime juice, and sour cream. The flavors all play well together to strike a classical tune of a Mexican bolero on the pallate. As previously mentioned, I like the tongue. It has a wonderful richness and gameyness to it that I have come to love. My far less adventurous girlfriend stays with the chicken. They have other choices ranging from pork, to steak, to shrimp, to the ever popular ground beef (gotta please everyone I guess).\n\nAfter you order your tacos, try one of the fresh made flavored waters there. The fresh lime water is always my favorite, and is there every day, but they also have hibiscus, watermelon and other flavor selections. My girlfriend got the horchata, a milk based concoction with cinnamon, nutmeg and sugar. Or you could pop inside the Mexican grocery for a Coke hecho en Mexico. My favorite Coke because they use cane sugar, not HFCS.\n\nThe only downside is that they close right around 3:00 PM.\n\nCome to Reyna's. The tacos are amazing. Do I really need to say any more?"
1,"The stand outside (edgars), chicken taco with everything on it, best ever."
1,"This is a top-notch mexican grocery, albeit a small one. They sell corn and flour tortillas made on location that will change your life. They also make a variety of fresh salsas and dips. It also has a good selection of hot sauces and pre-packaged salsas. There is a small selection of produce to and other groceries you need but might not find at regular grocery stores. Overall a must-visit if you're making some Mexican."
1,"Decided to try it for dinner as we were walking around the strip.  Good selection of beers too.\n\nStarted with mussels and they were very good.  Sherry butter sauce w lots of garlic.\n\nWe each had the seafood stew for dinner...tried to get beyond the lobster roll which is their signature dish\n\nStew was full of seafood.  Lobster,  clams, mussels, scallops, shrimp.  Good size portion at reasonable price.\n\nSauce was excellent and had just enough of a spice to have a nice tasting after bite but did not drown out the cream, old bay and sherry.\n\nWe will definitely be back."
1,"With the return of nice weather to the'Burgh, I've been able to get out on lunch and do some shopping.  I took a stroll down here 'cos it felt good to get out of the office and besides, I'm getting a little tired of the coffee from Giant Eagle.  Maxwell House and Folger's are okay, but soemtimes we need a little variety.\n\nSo I picked up some Olde Vienna which is a little darker than most American roasts, but not as dark as French Roast.  I also picked up a nice Kenya AA blend.  But I'm also become a tea lover and I picked up some Stash Decaffeinated Earl Grey--makes a great ice tea!  Great coffee and service here.  It's been a few years since I was here last and I'm gonna have to stop by more often."
1,"The first part in realizing that you have a problem is to admit it, well I have a coffee addiction. This place makes it very easy to feed my cravings by having a huge selection of regular and decaf coffees. I also think that the prices are reasonable and the staff is a lot of fun. I thank them for searching high and low when I request some coffees that may not be their biggest seller but I want to try. Stop in coffee lovers you will not be disappointed."
1,"I can't believe this place got a bad rating!!! Sure, it's not a 5-star restaurant, but you can't beat the price or the food!!!\nWhy would you order french fries at a Greek restaurant? I want everyone to disregard the previous bad rating about this place. \nI live about a block away from Salonika's, and I absolutely love it. The first time I went in, I noticed that it was rockin while every restaurant nearby was empty. Very good sign, trust me!!\nSure, there are no waiters. You order at the front counter and linger around until your food is ready, but I've never had to wait more than a few minutes. \nThe food is absolutely amazing!!! And cheap!!! My boyfriend loves the chicken with pasta, which is exactly what it says it is: pasta with chunks of chicken. It is lightly seasoned, but no heavy sauces. And it's amazingly filling. \nI always get the Greek salad or the pastitsio. The greek salad comes loaded with onions, feta, olives, and jalapeno peppers that are marinated in some kind of garlic marinade. And there is always enough dressing!!! Homemade dressing at that. \nThe pastitsio is definitely an acquired taste. It's like a greek lasagne, but without cheese. It consists of a large layer of very spiced beef, then layers of noodles and a cream sauce. \nI bring a lot of friends to Salonika's when they trek downtown to hang-out with me, and EVERY SINGLE PERSON I have introduced to this place absolutely LOVES IT!!! I usually make them get a gyro, and I can't tell you how many of my friends will go back up for another one because they are so good. The gyro meat is fresh, in fact they carve it right there. \nThere is also a bar in the back of the restaurant. I kind of wish it wasn't there because it attracts some \""unsavories\"" and takes away from the atmosphere in the restaurant. But you can't win them all.\nKeep in mind that this is a cash-only establishment, so hit the ATM on the way. \nYou will not be disappointed with this place. This place is really a gem!!!"
1,This place has one of the best Gyro's around..... They are cheap and Delicious......  The only thing I wish was that they took credit/debit cards.  If you want something that is fast and well worth the money I would recommend this place..... I have come downtown just to eat here. LOVE LOVE LOVE the GYROS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,"I love this place. Gyros, spinach pie, fries and hummus. Way better than any other gyro place in Pittsburgh."
1,"One of my absolute favorite places to eat in Pittsburgh.  The meals are a little bit more expensive than you normally want to eat as a student (I probably spend $20-25 with appetizer and dessert), but the food makes this hole-in-the-wall truly worth a trip.\n\nChristo is the owner of the restaurant and was at one time employed upon the Onassis yacht.  Years ago when I first came to his restaurant, he was the head waiter on a staff of one.  More recently when I have gone, there have been other hired waiters.  The service isn't great, but it's not terrible either.\n\nThe food offerings include standard middle eastern fare: hummus, baba ghanouj, phyllo-dough wrapped pockets, and kabobs.  The desserts also include standard middle eastern desserts like baklava and strong coffees, but the signature dessert is the Onassis dessert, a syrup-soaked cake topped with custard and whipped cream, dusted with cinnamon.  The last time I was there, he had added a chocolate Onassis dessert, which was also excellent.\n\nMy normal meal there consists of baba ghanouj (which is about the best I've ever had....it's a real hit-or-miss dish, and Christo's knocks it out of the park), a combination (lamb & chicken) kabob, and the Onassis dessert.\n\nIt's out of the way, but well worth a trip!"
1,"We were downtown looking for some place to eat before the show when I man standing outside showed us a menu. Boy, we were not the least disappointed. After hummus and pita chips, we all started off with an excellent very tasty fresh salad. The leg of lamb of excellent as was the sides of grilled vegetable and rice. I don't usually like hummus but it was tasty and excellent. The Jackie O cake is to die for.  We agree that the waiter were sort of odd, but in a very good way. Excellent prices. Homemade wine was also excellent."
1,Spag Warehouse is the best value for money in the tri-state area.... damn good food!!
1,"The rates here are perfectly reasonable. I have no idea if it costs women more, but it costs me less than $20 for my haircut. I do see an equal number of males and females in this place. Katie, specifically, is fantastic. She is very smooth and efficient, but double checks to make sure everything is right before sending me on my way. Couldn't recommend this place more."
1,"Really marvelous art presented in a beautiful setting.  The gift shop is one of the best in the city.  They feature crafts from artists around the world and local.  Shows are well lit and well presented.  Downstairs are studios where they teach classes on metals, wood, fiber, mixed media and book/paper arts (beginning to advanced). They do a great job of hosting outside events and fundraisers."
1,"The last time I ate at a Morton's was in Houston, TX, so I was very excited when BJ suggested that we dine here Saturday night. Had a 7:30 pm reservation, was greeted promptly and led to a comfy corner booth. The restaurant was very busy. Our server Georgeann was very friendly and hit it off right away with BJ. The two of them kept me entertained all night long! I don't know which one was the funniest. Well, BJ wins hands down. \n\nWe pondered the wine bible for a bit, but BJ is a beer dude (they have a somewhat limited selection) and I am more of a cocktail girl. Loved the cosmopolitans there. Very delicious. \n\nWe bypassed the appetizers, we both got Morton's salads, which were huge. I had a single cut filet and a crab cake, BJ also got a filet and bacon wrapped scallops. Both our steaks were very flavorful and cooked to perfection. For our sides, we shared asparagus and a loaded baked potato. \n\nWe could not pass on dessert. I had to have Morton's Legendary Hot Chocolate Cake and BJ had the Key Lime Pie. The chocolate cake was amazing, I love it. So did BJ.  He ate it instead of his pie.  We got the pie to go and it was also very, very good. \n\nGreat place for a special occasion. We had a wonderful evening."
1,Great place  . My favorite steak reaturant in Pittsburgh . The bar area could be bigger . The valet's were professional and quick .
1,I ordered the center-cut ribeye for entree. It was delicious. \nThe environment is nice and servers are polite. Recommended.
1,I love this Morton's. .the staff is great and the food is amazing..the ribeye was great and scallops wrapped bacon amazing
1,"Refined, classic style steak restaurant, Mortons will not disappoint those who are looking for a traditional upper end place. \n\nYards of linen, tons of silverware, and hordes of waiters make this place a must go in Pittsburgh.\n\nOur table of six enjoyed perfectly done steaks and fillets, beautiful accompaniments of vegetables and potatoes, great salads,  excellent desserts, along with an impressive wine offering.  \n\nExpect to pay heavily for this experience, it is well worth it."
1,Came here with my family for my fathers birthday. This place had it right from the start. Amazing menu. I had a porterhouse with lobster tail (same thing my father got) and we were both pleased! The staff was very very good and helpful. Everything we got to eat that night was 5 stars and exceeded all expectations. Cannot wait to go back!
1,"$3 chicken on a stick. The best value I know of in Pittsburgh and one of the tastiest things I can think of eating. Love that stuff and get it every time I'm in Pitt early enough to make it to the Strip District. They have a little table outside you can sit and eat at as well. The grocery store is alright, but I have no clue what most the stuff in there is, I always just go for the chicken."
1,Charming store with high quality items.  I've purchased business cards and placesetting cards. The staff was very attentive and detail oriented. Great customer service.
1,"These sandwiches are amazing. They fill you up, they're delicious, and it's chill place to go and eat. A must try."
1,"A staple of downtown work lunch. Excellent cheesesteaks, fresh fries, and a great crew of workers.\n\nA Pittsburgh classic in it's own, Peppi's is a must-eat cheesesteak destination in the downtown area.  I've been to Peppi's in the Strip and the North Shore and unfortunately they don't quite stack up (still good though)."
1,"The best place for coffee!!! I love everything about this place.. The atmosphere, the neighborhood feel, the baristas, and the patrons (especially the little Italian men sitting outside playing cards drink espressos). A huge favorite place in my book!!!"
1,"As close as you will get to an authentic Italian cafe in Pittsburgh (or most anywhere in the U.S.).  This is one of my favorite spots in the city.  The coffee is superb, the baristas are friendly and skilled.  Sam, the owner, is almost always around to greet regulars and newcomers alike.  A dopio (double) cappuccino with a slice of pizza from Colangelo's next door is a perfect way to spend a Saturday morning.  What completes this place is the atmosphere.  On any given Saturday morning the space is packed, spilling over to the outdoor seating.  On a shelf above the coffee machines in the upper left corner has a television permanently tuned to REI, the Italian television station.  There's usually a futbol game or some Italian news broadcast playing.  Without fail there will be these elderly Italian gentlemen playing a traditional card game in the corner.  For a great cup of coffee made however you like and the atmosphere of an authentic Italian cafe, go to La Prima Espresso."
1,"Easily the best espresso I have had in town. \n\nPrevious reviewers are correct - if you are used to the idea of a coffee shop that the local and national chains have given us, there really isn't room for that there. However, the coffee is second to none and for those of you that like to make your coffee at home, they do sell a wide selection of their beans at a reasonable price compared to other coffee shops."
1,Pastries and coffee you can't go wrong. You'll need to get here early if craving an almond croissant.. they tend to sell out by noon. Their other pastries are delicious as well. Try the mele as well. You can wash it all down with an expresso or what I like is an expresso macchiato!
1,I have fond memories of this place.  I was truly introduced to Italian Expresso and dry Italian snack pastries etc. Coming from small town Ohio and moved to the big city of Pittsburgh in the mid 90's I did not understand but got to know their product line.  My best friend at the time worked for LPE for about 7-8 years and traveled around to all of their Pittsburgh branches.  I have been to them all.  Hard working family owned  I have a fondness in my heart for this coffee.  Ground right when you order. I remember the friends and the family sitting out front until close on a Saturday afternoon parlare italiano in front of the store.  K sitting out front with her table of illustrated greeting cards. It was always packed on Saturday. I will probably add an addendum as I remember more.
1,"I am so absolutely disappointed that Pegasus closed! The name has been around for so long and many people know of it, even if they've never stepped foot in it. Pegasus was an amazing bar/club to go to to dance, socialize and roam their 3-4 floors. The dance floor was spacious and there were so many places to go if you grew tired of dancing! I never had one bad night at Pegasus! Every night there was an amazing adventure! The staff was great and the people there were so much fun! I met some great people there and the crowd was almost always friendly and fun. I really hope that Pegasus comes back because Pittsburgh needs it!"
1,I have had several negative experiences trying to find a good salon in the last year. Today I finally found a wonderful salon with an excellent stylist. Emily was very professional and friendly while highlighting and coloring my hair. She listened to exactly what I wanted and really did a fantastic job. I am very appreciative to her hard work and would definitely recommend this salon to everyone!
1,"We came here to see the play \""You say Tomato I Say Shut Up!\"" and what fun we had! The stage is visible from any seat, the waitress was never too far and the food was satisfying. We really had a great time and enjoyed watching a play while eating and drinking. Great time and we can't wait to come back for another show."
1,Best Asian grocery in Pittsburgh. Went shopping for ingredients for a Korean dish I was making and they had everything. Food is fresh also!
1,"This is hands-down the best Asian grocery I have visited in Pittsburgh. It is a huge store and is really well-organized so you can find what you are looking for pretty quickly. The absolute best thing about this place is the fresh tofu. Besides tasting better than the stuff from the regular store, it is outrageously cheap--$1 for 3 pieces (3 pieces = about 1 & 1/2 blocks of packaged tofu) They have a great section of Asian-style noodles, snacks, and sauces, with the brand variety you will never get at a typical grocery store. They also have a really good selection of fresh produce that is hard to find in other stores.\n\nBe warned, the products do not always have English translations. This doesn't mean newbies aren't welcome, it just means you might make a few mistakes on the way. The store clerks are usually not very helpful because 1) this place runs on a very small staff and everyone is always busy, and 2) many of the employees don't speak English very well. The small staff is part of the reason this place is so cheap, so cut them a break. As for the language barrier--it's a traditional Asian grocery store, so yes, English is not their first language; don't be surprised. I don't consider these detriments because this store perfectly suits my needs. It is definitely not an introductory course in Asian cuisine, so don't expect anyone to hold your hand. But if you know what you are looking for, or if you are just feeling adventurous and willing to make a few mistakes, this place is worth a look."
1,"I realized today that everyone should have a good tailor!  That realization came about from a trip to the lovely LuLu....\n\nI had an adorable vintage dress I had bought in Chicago last summer that was too large in all the wrong places and I kept putting off getting fixed.  I had a seamstress friend look at it and she was even stumped by the darts on the chest and how to exactly go about fixing it.  \n\nLuLu had be try the dress on and did a few simple markings and I was on my way.  She even encouraged me to make it a bit shorter, which I was on the fence about, but ultimately decided to do once she pinned it up.  I think a day or two later (after she had told me a week) she called to tell me it was done.  \n\nLet me tell you, the woman knows her way around a seam!  She worked her magic on that dress so that if fit be like a glove... it as beautiful!  I looked closer and could tell that she completely took apart the bodice to remake it so it fit me in the chest.  But she still kept the look of the dress so that the change was slight and still fit the style.  \n\nNow I'm mentally going through my closet thinking of all the things I'm excited to have her custom fit for me!  And of course, visit LuLu again, because she's so so sweet!\n\nNOTE: CASH ONLY!"
1,"Honestly, Lulu is amazing.  I'm never taking anything anywhere else to get altered!\n\nI have to admit I was a tad nervous when I put my bridesmaid dress on and she just pinched the bust, waist and hips and took measurements sans ruler and said, \""okay I'll text you when it's ready.\""  One, how can someone measure with their index finger and thumb and two, did she say text?  Did she mean email?!\n\nThe dress was completed in 3 business days, although I'm sure she works on Sunday (because she did text me to tell me so) and it fits like a glove!  It was cheap too!  Only $35 to take the bust, waist and hips in a few inches each.  She said \""don't worry about trying it on here.  I think it will be perfect.\""  Gotta love someone that takes that much pride in their work!"
1,"I needed a sweater rewoven and Lulu did an awesome job.  She was apologetic about being backed up wtih work, but I wasn't in a hurry. Pricing is very reasonable and she is very competent with her work.  I would highly recommend this business."
1,we were here last Nov.2011 for my bestfriend's wedding in Omni Hotel. we needed some alteration for one of the bridemaid's gown and Ms. Lou was so accommodating to our needs. it was a rush request/work and she did a great job!! thank you so much!!
1,"The ladies here are very sweet and talented. We had 2 bridal gowns that needed a bustle and minor alterations. The prices are very reasonable, the dresses came back perfect,  and the length in time getting them back was very fast. Is recommend this shop for any and all alterations."
1,"I can't say enough good things about Jim Ludwig's Blumengarten.  We hired them to do the flowers for our wedding in April, 2012 and the flowers were gorgeous!  My bridal bouquet was so beautiful and fragrant that it made me cry!  What I especially loved was that Jim and Linda Ludwig personally delivered the flowers to the venue.  Jim pinned the boutonniere on my husband and personally handed me my bouquet.  Such excellent customer service is rare these days and I highly recommend this business."
1,"I'm a foreigner and wanted to send flowers to my girlfriend living in a suburb of Pittsburgh. I contacted Jim Ludwig's Blumengartens florist after finding them here. Unfortunately they didn't deliver to the city I wanted my flowers to be sent to, but the Ludwigs have been very helpful and transferred my order to another florist that covered that area. \nThe contact has been fast and very friendly. I'll recommend and would consider them again."
1,"What a great store! Dean the owner/manager was extremely knowledgeable and helpful about which backpack was best for me.  Very generous 30-day return policy and a wide selection of travel accessories as well as luggage. A must visit if you need luggage and want to support local businesses, especially the few who are left Downtown."
1,"My wife and I have been shopping at Specialty Luggage downtown for years.  The staff there, particularly Matthew, are always willing to take the time to try and find the best product to fit your need.  If they don't have what you need, they say so, and will try to get it for you, although more often than not, if they don't have it, it doesn't exist.  We've purchased several pieces of luggage there and many accessories and everything has always been high quality.  They've also helped us get repairs for luggage efficiently and cheerfully and if there was any ambiguity about whether something was covered by a warranty, they gave us the benefit of the doubt.  The prices are reasonable and you get a lot better service than you can get from any online retailer.  It's worth it just to visit because you'll learn a lot about what's available; we've bought things there we didn't know existed and have been delighted with the result.  It's also been a great place for gifts during the holidays because of the diversity of products they offer."
1,"My favorite mexican restaurant. The ingredients are so fresh everything is made to order, their home made salsa is the best.  Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Foods not grease like you get at a lot of Mexican places\n\nPortions are very generous, you will not leave hungry. Only open for lunch and only takes cash. And it can get busy for lunch but where downtown doesn't.\n\nAll in all great food, excellent staff and a great Price. My go to Mexican pick"
1,"This has to be the best diner setting Downtown, a complete archetypal flashback of the greasy spoon meal alternative.  I'm pretty much a regular (2x a week) now so I wanted to update my review to point out that they've made a couple changes (maybe a different food purveyor) and the food is even better now.  The bread is fresher than ever, the turkey is nice and tender, and the bacon is scrumptious.  Service is still that  \""make yourself at home\"" but \""don't take yourself too seriously\"" that I truly enjoy."
1,"Walk through the door and immediately the sweet, spicy scents of flowers and greens envelops your senses. Fresh green earthy ferns, spiky AND soft cacti, terrariums filled with tiny worlds you'd love to explore in Tiny Alice form all crowd antique tables, shelves and hutches - a bounty of natural wonders there for sweet discovery. \n\nThe walls teem with both strikingly colorful and softly demure wreaths and wall accents. One glass topped and fronted case has huge jars of the most wonderful potpourri that you can scoop to your heart's content....just imagining your bedroom, living room, your entire home smelling like a little piece of heaven. \n\nThen, just as you pass that glass case an open door and a secret garden beckons with wonders of green outside. Melodious chimes, gurgling water, wondrous plants that you are certain deserve special places under no less than the glass roofs of Phipps Conservatory. \n\nWhat a wonderful respite from the rush and noise of the Strip....a quiet oasis. Thanks, Roxanne. Well done."
1,"I adore Roxanne's! There are so many beautiful arrangements and terrariums, and a great variety of live plants inside and out. You can also find lovely home decor in the form of side tables and such. On that note, I have even purchased an ethically made dress here! The employees are always a pleasure to chat with, and prices are reasonable for the quality you get. Even if you're not in the market for any of the aforementioned, stop in here and fulfill your senses."
1,"J'adore this store!!!  So beautiful and filled with many inspiration pieces. Very much on the pricey side, but a check online shows me that their stock is not too overpriced. This is def a room in heaven. :)"
1,"Oh Andy, how I miss your little swagger and sass! I know this is a difficult one to rate, since he runs a stand within another establishment (Wholeys) but I am giving 5 glowing stars nontheless for the amazing sushi he makes (right in front of you) and his stellar personality. I have never met a person with blood flowing in their veins that didn't get a total kick out of Andy.\n\nWhen I worked in the Strip, I ate here almost daily. After only two visits, he remembered exactly what I ordered and would start making it as soon as he saw me: spicy yellowtail with avocado. Or just yellowtail with avocado. Maybe some cucumber. Have I mentioned that I am obsessed with yellowtail? Ahhhh, the buttery-ness, the texture, the slight taste of the sea....oh wait, this isn't a review on a singular fish, i got a little carried away (even though Andy serves up some damn fine YT)! \n\nSometimes he gets creative and mashes different flavor concepts together for you to sample as you wait. He once came up with a maki roll made of salmon, basil, cucumber and mango....brilliant!!\n\nWholeys is such a fantastic people watching spot anyway and it's always amusing to see random people of all ages/genders/sizes walk in and yell \""ANDY\""!"
1,Andy has the best Sushi. His special sauce is what makes his sushi the best.
1,"Seriously,best sushi in Pittsburgh. Freshest ingredients, huge portions and very reasonable pricing. And yeah, Andy gives free samples if you smile at him!"
1,Ate here last night and it was absolutely the best meal I have had at Sushi Kim. Wife got the usual pork bulgogi and I got standar dol sut bi-bim-bap. \n\nIt was unbelievably good. It wasn't because I was really hungry. It was perfect. Every single bit of both meals was perfectly proportioned and seasoned. And the side dishes were GREAT except I really missed not having sweet potato and little omelet ban chan. I will cut out Dosani and Korean Kitchen as long as Sushi Kim keeps this up!
1,"We are so lucky to have such an amazing theater community in Pittsburgh.  This unique theater adds so much to the mix!  It's a fantastic theater because they focus on plays, usually with one musical in the mix. There's new works here, like the original show The Chief, about what else, but Pittsburgh Steelers founding owner Art Rooney.  They bring in the classics like A Midsummer Night's Dream and The Important of Being Earnest.  They also have newer works right off Broadway, like The Rabbit Hole and Superior Donuts.  Plus, they bring in Second City every year, which is big in my book because they've spawned a couple SNL cast members!! \n\nI absolutely LOVE the theater!  I'm a big fan of a theater in the round.  That means there's seating on 3 sides of the stage.  They've also been able to do some really cool things with the stage/set, like making an actual pool for the show Metamorphoses.  My favorite all time show was The Secret Letters of Jackie and Marilyn, which was a world premiere.  The show was about a made up relationship between the two women where they wrote letters to each other.  It was a VERY cool concept! \n\nThey also do a lot of great events like the Mix at 6 for young professionals before a show.  Plus, they understand that most of us under 26 (and of course sometimes above) are broke ho's, they offer $15 tickets!  The great thing is, there's really not a bad seat in the house! \n\nAgain, we have a fantastic theater district, so TAKE ADVANTAGE and go here!  Don't make me tell you twice!!"
1,"Totally underrated by the Yelpers!\n\nI freakin' LOVE Redfin Blues.  I'm kind of glad it had a low rating previously to keep y'all away while I was living in Pittsburgh!  The only reason I'm even reviewing it now is because I have moved away and I'm not at risk for losing my table to a Yelp reader.  Also, I feel guilty at not letting people in on this gem.\n\nTo be clear, I LOVE Redfin Blues for a very SPECIFIC purpose: sitting outside on the patio by the water on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon drinking the bar out of Red Stripe and white wine and eating peel and eat shrimp by the 2 pound bowl with B, Ems, Boyfriend, and whoever else is so lucky.  It is a hidden gorgeous Pittsburgh oasis under the 31st bridge near Washington's Landing (note: the Yelp map is wrong) where you don't feel at all like you're in Pittsburgh, but instead on vacation.\n\nDisclaimer: I have heard that at night it is full of strange frat boys (from no actual fraternity), Cougars, tramps, creatures of the night  -- or undesirables.  I don't go at night so my credibility wanes here a little.\n\nI basically only ever eat the peel and eat shrimp.  It's just cooked shrimp - sometimes it's big, sometimes it's little.  But it's $17 for TWO pounds which isn't too overpriced especially since it can feed a tableful of friends.  Ask for extra old bay if you like it spicy and salty - yum! I've also had the fried cod sandwich - the fish is crisp and flaky and darn good!  I always take it off the bread to keep it as crispy as possible but those who know me know I have an obsession with fried crispy-ness.  The breading isn't too too heavy so that is a plus too.  I've also had the crab cakes which are meh  but fine for Pittsburgh standards and I would definitely steer clear of the crab legs.  \n\nOk, so really you should go to this place - if you like peel and eat shrimp, cold drinks by the river, and occasionally a keyboardist who plays and sings in the background pretty quietly.  Some of my favorite Pittsburgh moments happened here and that's saying a LOT.  Redfin Blues makes me miss you Pittsburgh!"
1,"This is SUCH a gorgeous boutique -- shabby chic furnishings galore! If you're in the market for truly unique, special furniture and live anywhere near Pittsburgh, Hot Haute Hot is the place you're looking for. \n\nI came here with my friend who had long been on a quest to find a new dining room table. The options here were so gorgeous I was immediately struck with envy. There are curio cabinets, amazing reclaimed ceiling tile mirrors, plush chairs, fantastic lamps and a bevy of side tables, wall hangings and of course, dining room tables. \n\nThe service is impeccable -- sweet, helpful women who know every item in their shop and are just as excited to help you shop as you are to find perfect item. The taste level in this store is impressive, as well. \n\nAs a bonus, they have a few displays of fun, affordable jewelry ranging from delicate to super funky. Take your time to pick through this shop and enjoy yourself while doing it -- I certainly did!"
1,"Just as I was about to give up on finding a downtown hair salon, I found Denham & Company and Dan!  Quite a nice cut and those yummy Aveda products, to boot.  \n\nComfortably eclectic is how I'd describe the shop in Market Square just to the right of NOLA and up a steep flight of stairs.  Antiques on beautiful hardwood floors interspersed with contemporary salon chairs make for warm and friendly surroundings, which is just exactly what I found in the staff, too...warm and friendly AND skilled.\n\nThanks Dan AND Denham & Company!  You've restored my faith in downtown hair salons!"
1,"Sheer ecstatic bliss is what this place should be called! wonderful talented friendly hairdressers!  My friend and I went there for the first time today, let them cut our follicle fillers as they saw fit, and have never been more satisfied in our short little lives.\n\nIf you want bumpin' style and sexy looks, HIT IT UP!!!!"
1,"I've tried many different salons throughout the city since moving here 6 years ago, and once I found Tim at Denham & Co, I haven't gone anywhere else! My hair is crazy thick and I always have troubles coloring it but Tim always gets the perfect shade and cuts it in the best way. I get so many compliments on the color anywhere I go. The price is definitely worth it, plus you'll have a great time while you're there - staff is super friendly and talkative. If you're looking for stylish look, need help with color, suggestions for a overall new look - go here! 2 of my best friends already have gone here after I did."
1,Dan is awesome!
1,Julie does a fantastic job. Been going to her for years. The attention to detail is tremendous and I come away with a haircut I can have confidence in.
1,"I'm not sure why this place isn't getting better reviews! I've been here twice over the last couple months (including yesterday)  and have been very happy each time I've gone.\n\nCaffe Amante is located on the second floor (food court) level of Fifth Avenue Place, the home of HighMark Blue Cross Blue Shield.\n\nAmongst most of the mediocre chain food that's served on the same floor, it stands out as basically the only(or one of a few) sit down places available.  \n\nBoth times the service was right on point.  Quick, efficient, despite being busy, friendly, wait-until-I-finish-my-sentence-sensitive, good recommendations on food.  Corrected themselves when they were wrong in what they told me previously and so on.\n\nThe two dishes I've had are:\n\nSpecial Salmon and jumbo lump crab meat.  It was expertly cooked, great flavors, good portion size, and overall just a winning dish.\n\nDi Mare Amante which is a dish with shrimp, scallops, in a white clam sauce with capellini noodles.  Their menu spells it with two p's: cappellini.\n\nBoth were great and I'd have them again.\n\nYou know, part of my review and rating is based on exactly what this place is: a more upscale place for the mostly business clientele bringing their customers out for a conveniently located lunch. In a restaurant that is more or less in a food court. Being surrounded chinese joints, mexican burrito places, and the philly cheese steak place.\n\nWhile I think it would be a solid bet for dinner as well --- that's not how I see this place positioned. I wouldn't take a date here Friday or Saturday night. There are more exciting places offering more adventures fare.\n\nThis is not your $8 lunch.... most things are priced $12-$16 which includes bread. Their prices well justified by the quality of the food.\n\nFor lunch, I'd go back to this place in a heartbeat."
1,"Located downtown, call Dr. Greg and he can get you in that day, sometimes within the hour.  He's a cool guy, very friendly, and not a new-age, hippy, sales-y doctor like some of the other chiropractors that I've been to.  Accepts insurance & FSA...if you work downtown, I recommend him."
1,"Everyone at Salon Nuvo is a professional.  Everyone is friendly and it's a really great salon.  Chrissy has done my hair for almost 15 years (she moved to Salon Nuvo about 2 years ago) and I trust no one else to perm or color my hair.  Chrissy understands chemicals and how to maintain healthy hair.  She's a dedicated professional and has always been flexible - she let's me come in late to accommodate my work/school schedule.  And everyone I've ever referred to her has been a happy customer :-)  I'm pretty brutal on my hair (lots of heat and don't deep condition as often as I should, in addition to a fair amount of every day stresses)....If Chrissy didn't maintain and take care of my hair, I'd probably be bald by now!  She keeps it trimmed, healthy, and growing!!!  And she's super sweet....it's a delight to sit in her chair :-)"
1,"I have been going to Salon Nuvo for about two years now. Autumn does my hair and she is amazing. I have very fine, thinning hair and the cut is always flattering. And Autumn seems quite supportive of my desire to not color my very grey hair, which is something I have not had in other salons ... there has always been a push to do some sort of coloring treatment."
1,"I came here for lunch recently and all was excellent. I come here about 4 times a year. When I do go I prepare myself by not eating red meat several days prior to going. On the day of I make sure to eat a normal but smaller breakfast. No bagels as they occupy too much space. I arrive a bit later, I am a bit hungrier and the staff that remains are long time regulars who know me but are also there to earn a living and make my visit worthwhile. I always order a filet, medium with mushrooms. I don't drink when go, the beef is too good to have my senses misdirected. The plate and filet arrive in minutes, the plate is sizzling at 500 degrees, if by chance there is too much red in the meat I cut a piece and sizzle it right there on the plate. I recently tried the salmon on a recommendation from the owner and was wowed how good it was. Panko crumbs and lemon, great stuff. \nI always feel they go the extra mile for me but the food and service are always top notch i can assume this is the standard."
1,"Always amazing! My Husband and I frequent Ruth's Chris for almost every special-occasion: birthdays, anniversaries, when we need a great meal; and without fail we leave euphoric. \n\nAfter almost each bite, we close our eyes to shut-out the sense of sight to focus on the taste and aroma of the garlicky, creaminess of the Remoulade on our salads; the richness of the Pesto on our Sea Scallops; the buttery-goodness of our dry-aged steak; and the salty crunch of our French Fries, which Kathy suggested we dip into Honey-mustard for a fantastic salty-sweet combination.\n\nFriday is a good reason to go... Reservations are calling!"
1,"I loved my everything about my experience at Ruth Chris.  It was a bit expensive, but the service was outstanding and the food was delicious.  \nI would definitely go again."
1,"No matter which location I go to, I am never disappointed with Ruth's Chris.  I would live here if I could...  Feeling hungry?  Try the Porterhouse...AWESOME!"
1,Best Steaks in Pittsburgh!!! I come here a lot for special occasions.  It is a pricy place but it is worth every penny. I had a New York Strip and it was really tender and juicy.  Definitely one of my favorite restaurants.  The service is excellent also.
1,"Always top notch service and food at Ruth's Chris Pittsburgh. They have some summery specials during these cold winter months to bring you out of the post-holiday funk, which is very refreshing to see. Stop in for lunch for great deals on amazing food. Their lunch cuts of beef, chicken and fish include 2 sides and a salad for an extremely reasonable price. I got the lunch petite filet, veggies, mashed potatoes and appetizer salad for 28 bucks! Not bad for a steakhouse. Our server was incredible, as usual, and was extremely attentive of my gluten-free needs. The servers are extremely knowledgeable of the menu and will accommodate you no matter what. The decor is a bit dated and is due for a remodeling, but perhaps that will be on the list of things to do for the chain since they are celebrating their 25th anniversary this year!"
1,"I read an article recently in the Post-Gazette that says to wring the most wear out of what they own, people are visiting auto mechanics, cobblers, tailors and computer repair experts as they haven't in years.  I believe it.  Business at Ullrich's has been good recently, especially since they moved into their present location.  Ullrich's has been around in one form or another for over 80 years and a couple of years ago they moved to their present location.\n\nUllrich's offers a full line of services including shoe and purse repair, desalt and waterproofing, and jacket and zipper repair.  Can't make it into their store?  You can even send your shoes to be repaired via mail!  No, really!  Check it out!    http://www.ullrichshoerepair.com/mailorder.htm\n\nAnyway, my husband Rick asked me to drop off his shoes to get them resoled here.  I just picked them up on lunch a few minutes ago and they look practically new.  He had me drop off his leather jacket to have a tear repaired last year and they did a fantastic job.  I've had one of my purses repaired here too.  We've always been satisfied with their work.  \n\nIt's so good to see people renovate and repair rather than throw out.  Rick and I have been doing that for years."
1,"Hey, they linked to my review on their website!   Just click on News & Links and then on Customer Review http://www.ullrichshoerepair.com/newslinks.htm  Like Steve Martin in \""The Jerk\"" when he finds his name in the phone book, I guess I'm somebody now!  \n\nAll kidding aside, Ullrich's came in handy last week.  I broke a heel and they did a great job repairing it.  They've resoled Rick's shoes, repaired a tear in his leather jacket, and repaired one of my purses.  We've always been happy with their work."
1,"Miracle worker. Genius.  The guy here is amazing. This may be the best place on earth. I only recently discovered the fabulousness of having your shoes repaired instead of throwing them out. I walked in there with heels on that were so beat I was walking on metal rods (don't judge). He fixed them in about 10 minutes and they looked brand new.  \n\nYesterday I took my most favorite pair of boots, a unique pair of Steve Madden cognac leathers with rawhide ties up the backs, in with the hopes they could be salvaged.  The boot heals were slowly breaking down. Not only did he completely replace the heels to look like the day I bought them, but he shined them all up all pretty and suggested a cream to put on them to make them last forever.  He said they'd last 40 years. I said 'you, me and these boots are gonna be lifelong friends'. \n\nBest cobbler ever!!!"
1,"So I don't ever go Downtown because well Downtown is kind of icky. Eh, whatever I guess that's really besides the point. Anywho, After getting my eyebrows done at Princess Nails from Michelle (EYEBROW FAIRY!) I needed to cut a new set of keys because apparently holding onto keys is lost on me. I doubt my landlord wants to be woken up at 2:00am to let me in again either. After calling 7349651474 locksmiths that wouldn't duplicate keys because they're stooopid someone from the Office Depot sent me to Ulrichs Shoe Repair. Yes, Shoe Repair. Fix your shoe, make a key. Upon entering Ulrichs (I think it was the owner) was super friendly and I'll give him credit for being somewhat funny. Gave him my keys and in literally 30 seconds flat both keys were made AND they both worked. Usually going to somewhere like Home Depot you have to go back like 3 times for the key to work properly. Not in this case. Overall customer service amazing. Quality of service amazing. Plus super cheap too! $2 bucks a key. Um that's a deal if I ever saw one."
1,"I've been to Ullrich's twice and both times received excellent service.\n\n My first time at Ullrich's was to have the end caps of my heels replaced (for a second time). Initially I went to another repair store in Sq Hill and had them replaced -- but the replacement heels were totally wore out again within a couple months.  Went to Ullrich's to have them redone and after 6 months of hard walking, the heels are still wearing great.  \n\nI won't go any where else."
1,"I am really careful with how my shoes are handled. Every time I buy a new pair of shoes, I immediately have sole protection covered. This was actually my first time doing anything like this in the states, and I really wanted to go to a place that does a perfect job. \n\nAt the shop I met Rex, whom he was very kind and friendly. Still, I was still skeptical about this shop so before I departed after giving my new pair of shoes I asked a one last final request to be EXTRA careful with my shoes. And guess what? He did an amazing job and I am really happy how he got it to be perfectly thin as I wanted."
1,I can't find a complaint about this place.  Drinks are reasonable.  Only ever seems to be a $1 cover.  Couches for lounging.  Pool table.  Room for dancing if you want to (no one hardly seems to).\n\nStaff is super friendly.  During Pride it is a place you can stop into to get a drink cheaper than the beer tents outside.
1,"The owner and her parents are delightful, helpful and kind. I often stop in here for a little treat or blast from the past. I grew up in England and love that I can buy chocolates that I loved as a child. If you need a recommendation or a gift, they are always willing to help you choose something or put together a little gift basket within your price range."
1,"I don't think I've ever seen this great a variety of chocolate assembled in one place in my life! I think Augustus Gloop might have a heart attack and die in here, clutching a chocolate bar in his hand. \n\nThey have chocolate from all over the world in weird and exotic flavors to normal ones too. My two nephews were allowed to pick anything they wanted, and so were my husband and I. We didn't buy much, but what we did buy, between us all, cost my sister about $100! On chocolate!!\n\nI think it's a great place to stop in if you have a choco hankering, or are in the market to try something new."
1,"Soft, made to order bagels. Great low-fat smoothies. Staff is always nice and patient with my gazillion order changes. There's so many great choices! They also have texting sign-ups and I get free coffee and bagels with my orders all the time."
1,"We just happened to wander in after an afternoon of exploring Pittsburgh.  What a gem!  What a lucky place to stumble in!\n\nKlavon's was a drugstore/soda fountain in the early 1900s.  All the original counters, glass cases filled with old bottles, stools, and mixers are still there.  We had the turtle sundae with amaretto whipped cream, which was amazing.  I can't wait to come back and try their phosphates and egg creams!  It was like stepping into a time machine. You can tell this place is beloved by locals; several elderly couples, families with children, and single people with dogs on leash came by for cones, sundaes, and floats on the beautiful sunny day.  The grandson of the original owners was chatting with customers, and the place had a really special vibe.\n\nYou almost never see places like this anymore - if you're in Pittsburgh, don't miss it!"
1,"When I die I hope I come back as an ice cream bowl at Klavon's so I can forever spend my days covered in mint chocolate chip and watching people smile. I don't know...maybe not, but I do love mint chocolate chip and old skool ice cream parlors and Klavon's does both really well. \n\nThis is a list of things at Klavon's that make me feel like vintage stuff isn't only for grandparents and ice cream isn't just for kids: Amaretto flavored whipped cream, swivel stools with red tops, high backed wooden booths, a man behind the counter with a pure white handlebar mustache, a hammered tin ceiling, and large pecan balls.\n\nYou can go with chocolate or vanilla, but when I get the chance to have a pecan ball, I'm no idiot, I take it. A pecan ball, my friend, is ice cream rolled in pecans, covered in hot fudge or caramel and then topped with whipped cream. That's all tasty, nutty, fudgy goodness, but if you wake up feeling like painting the town gold and you want something that tastes like it was made for Cleopatra by Mark Antony's own hands, get a scoop of coffee, a scoop of pecan and top it with Amaretto whipped cream: I'm hoping to get this added to the menu under the name \""Magic Magic Explosion.\"" \n\nThey have a picture of Joe Biden posing with the owners; it's taped to the mirror behind the bar and quite adorable. \""He was very nice and left $20 for the next little girl in line to buy her ice cream with,\"" the owner told me.  Also, $20 worth of ice cream?! Two scoops only runs five bucks. Joe Biden--excuse me, Mr. Biden--you are a true American hero and I, for one, am happy someone finally realized the importance of children having tons and tons and tons of ice cream. \n\nGood show, sir, good show."
1,"Worth a visit from across the country. Klavon's recalls about 100 years ago with its true ice cream soda fountain days. It's been in the same family since around the strike of 1900 when it was a drug store and turned into this sometime in the last century. The styling seems to be a better and more true throwback than even Pittsburgh itself. Who would not like this has no soul.\n\nI only sampled the hot chocolate and two types of whipped cream, but I give it 5-stars anyways. I feel like this is an intelligent guess. The whipped cream was my favorite of all time, the amaretto whip didn't even strike me as amaretto, it swooned me lightly."
1,"There are five reasons why you might want to go to Klavon's.\n1. You're in the Strip District anyway.\n2. You're interested in Pittsburgh history.\n3. You've never experienced an old-time soda fountain before.\n4. You're looking for some hard-to-find penny candy.\n5. You want some damn good ice cream.\n\nI went for all five reasons, and I wasn't disappointed. Wait. That doesn't express the depths of my enthusiasm for Klavon's. KLAVON'S RULES!!!!!!!!! There, that's better.\n\nLet's take it in order. You have lots of dining options in the Strip. Now, Klavon's is a few blocks away from most of the popular places (we were at Salem's, which is also great, but that's another review), but it's easy to walk to and easy to find with all the neon signs.\n\nWhen you walk in to Klavon's, you're taken back in time. Choose a little booth or table, and gaze at the decor. Maybe you'll see an old liniment bottle from back when Klavon's was a drugstore. Maybe you'll notice the high-water mark from the 1936 flood (close to the ceiling!). Maybe you'll see the old penny scale or the phone booths. This is a place where history is celebrated.\n\nThe menu isn't extensive, but you still have lots of choices. Why not try an old-time phosphate, malted, or egg cream? It was good enough for your great-grandpa; it's good enough for you. I treated myself to a root beer float. It was the best I ever had. The reason? Both the root beer and the ice cream were made locally. On the way out, why not browse the penny candy racks? For a quarter, you can try a bunch of hard-to-find treats.\n\nI'd be remiss if I didn't mention that Mr. Klavon, the grandson (I think) of the original owner, still runs the place. A glipse of his epic mustache alone is worth the visit, but he's always willing to give you a tour. Friendly people in friendly Pittsburgh. I can't wait to go back!"
1,Easy 5. Authentic old school ice cream parlor with PSU ice cream ( peachy paterno etc). The ice cream soda was an outstanding ride in the wayback machine.
1,Just found this gem.  This is a great place for every ice cream lover.  Great place to hang out with friends or to go on a date.\n\nI recommend the sundaes at this place.  This is pure 50's and 60's style that isn't forced.  Staff are very friendly and patient.
1,"Retta is knowledgeable, intuitive and strong.  She gives a great massage."
1,"I used to go to Sammys all the time for a corned beef sandwich whenever i came in town....until my mom took me to Smallman Street Deli! Best corned beef on rye...be sure to get it grilled!!! My sandwich...lean corned beef on marble rye, swiss cheese, grilled with lettuce, tomato, onion and spicy brown mustard!! Love this place!"
1,Great theater !!! Absolutely beautiful .. Live the seating ... Seen Book of Mormon here !!! Loved it
1,I like coming here. Saw the Lion King. Bathrooms get crowded so you better hurry.  I'll be back.
1,"Giving my local businesses some loving. I frequent here & will never gives money elsewhere. There is a touch less car wash right down the street for the same prices who cleans half what this place does. I personally prefer an actual hand wash anyday. If you do come here, those these guys a buck or 2 in the tip. I've never had a guy here that didn't make sure every little mark or wet spot was off the car before I drove off the lot."
1,"I was recently in some training in Pittsburgh, and we came here towards the end of our class.\n\nThey had a sign on the curb outside that said they had \""the best prime rib\"".  Now, I don't think I can say that they had \""the best\"", but it was very good, and a pretty big serving too.\n\nOur waiter (John) was exceptional, excellent service, fun personality, very knowledgable."
1,This is always one of my favorite stops when visiting the Strip. A wide variety of party favors and Pittsburgh paraphernalia.
1,"I freakin' love this place. Anything you could possibly want, they've got it. And probably a lot of stuff that you don't want. \n\nI loved that everyone listed the crazy things they've seen there - they have all of that and so much more. 2 gems a friend got while we were there: a giant bottle of sriracha sauce & a fake tattoo sleeve. Ha!!\n\nAll I got was a postcard, this was the only place I found in the Strip District that sold them. \n\nWill definitely be back, and will remember to leave plenty of room in my suitcase next time!"
1,"Excellent food, nice beverages, more than fair prices, & great service. Waitress remembered us & was a doll. Owner Elias is a delightful gent & such a really welcoming character. We'll be back. Very pleased."
1,"First I want to say I LOVE coffee & I don't even understand the people writing reviews on here that DON'T drink or like coffee!!!!  So please look at the reviews of actual coffee lovers!!   I LOVE the Fortunes Coffee's.  We don't live there but stumbled into this place while walking down the Strip District.  I bought their Pumpkin Spice coffee & brought it to my son's house there to brew.  It was AWESOME!  So I had to go back & buy plenty more of both reg & decaf.  Now everytime we go back to Pittsburgh we have to go there & stock up.  If you want good tasting coffee, get it there!  The people there are very nice & helpful also!  I am drinking a cup of their coffee right now here in Florida & about to order some on their website!  YUMMY!!"
1,"I visited this gallery during a PA trip in August and forgot to add my inaugural visit's review. Why add it now? More people need to know about this gallery.\n\nArt spaces that stimulate on intellectual and emotional levels are far and few, especially in the Midwest. This gallery's curated installations corrects this. After finding the entrance on the corner of Wood and Sixth, we took the elevator up to the gallery above the T-Station to immediately find a hospitable gentleman sitting quietly at a dimly lit table in a small hallway area. He explained a little about the installation and directed us around the corner to Ryoji Ikeda's audiovisual installation piece data.tron. Simply amazing. It was a total immersion within site and sound with ample room to stand or sit to fully experience the projections.\n\nIf you love installation and the arts leaving this place will be bittersweet. Wood Street feeds the famine but leaves you hungry for more."
1,"I live downtown & I LOVE Chinese food. Living down here it's been wonderful having the ability to have things delivered other than pizza. \nSO... my fianc\u00e9 & I order from here often enough that I believe they know us by name practically.\nEverything we've ordered has been really good. Not epic good... but good.. EXCEPT their peppered chicken IS amazing good. BIG AWESOME GOOD... a must if you order from here.... it's basically the best thing they have on their entire menu.. I'm pretty sure that's totally accurate. \nI order online mostly but when I do call in an order - the person who answers is always nice - easy to understand. The delivery person is always smiley & super nice too.\nOne time they forgot our steamed dumplings - I called & told them the problem... the person came back & delivered them within a few minutes of the mishap & was super apologic & really sweet.\nI know this place has gotten some rotten reviews over some time but it's very easy to do that as people don't always give the happy reviews when they're pleased typically.\nSO, I say - give it a try people - order the peppered chicken - it's excellent - you're welcome in advance & if you're happy - write a happy review. :)"
1,"Great place. I prefer the cheese here over Penn Mac any day! Plus, the french feta is to die for!"
1,"I wish I lived close to this store. Unfortunately we don't have anything like this in the Phoenix area.\nI could write a ton of stuff about their selection. Wonderful choices, amazing prices, helpful staff and Chocolate Baklava.\nI wish I had more room in my suitcase when I left town. \nI will be back next year looking for more goodies to take home.\nTake your time looking around, you'll find lots to love and try for the first time."
1,"This is a great little store.  I walked right in off the street and asked if I could have scraps of silk, wool, cotton, leather and polyester.  I was met with a ready smile and whisked through the store where one of the workers was gracious enough to assist me and cut small swatches of fabric from the rolls.  This store looks well stocked and I really appreciated getting the small swatches for free.  This location made it very easy for me to find what I was looking for. \n\nThank you so very much Gene Sanes Upholstery."
1,"My mom called me so giddy on the phone today, I thought she was going to tell me she won the lottery.  No.  Her sofa from Gene Sane arrived.  It made her just as happy.  \n\nShe and I went to Gene Sane a few months ago and found fabric for a sofa and chair.  The fabric was not inexpensive.  Some of that they have is really beautiful designer fabric, some of it is not so special and I am convinced could be found elsewhere for less.  However, they did have excellent customer service throughout the entire upholstering process.  And my parents ended up getting two sofas and three chairs done there.\n\nMy parents live in Oakland in a condo building with a ridiculously small elevator.  Gene Sanes went above and beyond to make sure this extremely long sofa from my grandma would fit in the elevator at my parents' building.  They brought the sofa mid-upholstery to the building just to make sure it would fit into the elevator.  That is such great customer service it is ridiculous.  It did fit, which is great, but their backup plan was to upholster it as two pieces which would then seamlessly be fit together as one inside the apartment.  This is the kind of stuff that high end places in NYC know how to do and even though they ended up not having to do it in this case, it was good to know they have the skills to do so.  They were also great with attention to detail of lining up all the stripes on all the cushions both front and back.  These are the kinds of things that make a big difference."
1,"\""Hey, darling, you talkin' to your boyfriend?\""  the deli counter man recently teased me as I waited in line talking on my cell phone.  Oh the deli men - they're hilarious.  I'd even say, their worth the trip out to the store, but you might want to know more about the food, glorious food. \n\nI shop at the Macaroni Company weekly.  They're great.  From the deli men who hand you samples of meats and cheeses while you wait, to the great selection of bulk foods, to fine selection of meats to the Italian cheeses, to the fill-a-bottle- olive oil station to the fresh pasta to the bulk spices section to the moon and the sun and the earth and Jupiter, this place is lovely.  (Or loverly if your Eliza Dolittle).  The place tends to be packed like a tin of touch-a-philic sardines on the weekends, and I think many people are tourists, but that doesn't stop it from being great. And, that was a long sentence, but not as long as those of some really antiquated authors I've read.\n\nIn any case, the Macaroni Company is a little slice of Italy mixed with Pittsburgherness and fun."
1,"I will never buy any type of Italian sausage at Giant Eagle again because now i know what real sausage tastes like.  And, the deli counter guy at Giant Eagle doesn't inappropriately and amusingly call me \""babe\"" every five seconds like the ones at Penn Mac do.   Ordering \""hot italian sausage\"" from a deli guy that calls you \""babe\"" is as amusing as Sunday morning can get.   :-)    \nI'll keep coming here for fresh meats and cheeses as long as I live in Pittsburgh."
1,"Simply amazing! \n\nThey have everything! I especially love the cheese selection and bulk olives. The Penn Mac sauces are delectable and a quick fix on those lazy days when you don't feel like making your own, I just wish they made alfredo. I would much rather spend my money here than all of the Giant Eagle's that monopolize my city."
1,"My family and I have strong ties to Pittsburgh despite living in the Akron, Ohio area. Several times a year, however, we always make a point of visiting Pittsburgh, especially right before Christmas. Nothing spells Christmas quite like the Strip, and in particular, PennMac. The thought of the cheese/olive room is enough to bring a tear to my eye. I stocked up on jarred sauces, which are reasonably priced, generously portioned, and most importantly--fresh and delicious. We stacked loaves of bread in the car as well. Seeing all the salted fish (for the upcoming feast of 7 fishes) was beautiful. The most memorable part of the visit, however, was in a small, rather grimy room that boasted huge canisters of home-made wine and small glasses. Initially under the impression that I was intruding upon the staff holiday party, a smiling worker told me that customers were welcome to sample the wine. I was a little wary of trying the un-labeled wine, but it was wonderful and warming. While not available for sale, the wine tasting was a delightful way to warm up from the particularly vicious cold and mingle with other customers. Armed with an arsenal of goods to take back to Ohio, we returned home, satisfied and entirely in the Christmas spirit."
1,"A required stop on every visit to the Strip. Best selection of Pasta, cheeses and meats. Try the Antipasto salad at the Olive bar. It's the best!"
1,"LOVE this place!!  They have everything authentic Italian you could want without being in Italy!  Got some Gouda, sopressata and olives. Always love visiting here when in town!"
1,"This is about as real and authentic as Italian food shopping gets.  In a very rare instance (rare for me at least), I can truthfully say that this is indeed your Grandfather's Italian market!  Thus, it isn't pretty like you would see at one of those \""yuppified\"" gourmet markets (won't name and names) but I have been coming here since early childhood and it has scarcely changed.  In fact the same boxes of aromatic salt cod remain at the entrance welcoming customers for well over 30 years!  I am always fearful that places like these are in danger of going away mainly due to corporations coming in and driving them out.  However, Pennsylvania Macaroni Co is a true institution and its name (backed up by the absolutely outstanding quality) is what keeps it going strong!  Pittsburgh is an amazing town and seriously for many people, this is a true Pittsburgh landmark!"
1,I just love to visit this store. As you enter the store you can feel the Italian vibe. We purchased the best olive I have ever had. I discovered fresh mozzarella yum! I just made the homemade pasta for dinner. The black pepper linguine was so good. I need to go back for more real soon. It is a great place to find wonderful gifts for all occasions.
1,"A must-see in Pittsburgh. As a West Coast dude, I don't get to see many places like this. Just fantastic.\n\nTheir shipping operation is also exceptional."
1,"This is Italian heaven.  It has everything the Italian Pittsburgher could want.  I've since moved away from Pittsburgh but recently was sent some Penn Mac merchandise and it was a dream!  They package everything so well and ship it quickly!  I couldn't have asked for a better and tastier gift.  The store is perfection, but you already know that from other reviewers :)"
1,"Unlike many historic theaters across the country, the Harris Theater has been lovingly restored, and is actually a great place to watch a movie.  In a past life, it showed porno movies.  Now it screens eclectic art-house films and other smart selections programmed by PGH Filmmakers.\n\nLocated on Liberty Street downtown, the theater is easily accessible via public transportation.  The concessions are cheap, and the seats are comfy.  What more could you ask for?"
1,"Our in-laws suggested Dr. Battle and company when our dog, Levi, suddenly got ill.  The staff was very kind and caring even when the diagnosis was not positive.  They gave us as much time as we needed to stay with Levi and were sympathetic."
1,"Ok yes I almost never give a business 5 stars. But this one deserves it. My pup has been going to this hospital ever since I got him, at 3 months old. He's now 9 yrs old. I refuse, even though I travel so much, for any other vet to give him his vaccinations or wellness checkups. I will make a special trip back to Pittsburgh for my pup.\nSo anyway,  yesterday we had a slight emergency. I saw my pup limping and his paw looked like it was in pain. I immediately went to Penn Animal Hospital.  We maybe waited 10 minutes and were seen. The dr...look I know this might not mean much to most folks...but he wasn't afraid. My dog is huge...but he's a teddy bear. He loves people wayyy more than other animals. So instead of acting like 9, he acts like he's 2. Super happy all the time. The dr. was patient and listened to all my concerns. Overall a very good experience. \nI have to disagree with one of the yelpers. While they do not have electronic records (still paper and pen) they do annotate everything.  I do keep my own records as well...but there was a time that I needed to board my dog and I couldn't find my paperwork. I called Penn Animal and they faxed the documentation to me at work. So yes they do have a fax machine. I do worry about if there is a fire or flood...the records would be lost. But will this stop me from going here? Absolutely not."
1,"I absolutely love this place! They have some of the greatest gyros I have ever had. However, that is not the only thing they have that is good. All of their salads and sandwiches are outstanding! I would recommend this place to anyone. Also, the employees are extremely nice and work hard to make sure everyone is served as quickly as possible."
1,"So we were walking down Penn, showing some family from out of town all the cool shops and eateries on the strip, and we're parched. We step inside Prestogeorge's and are immediately assaulted with wonderful aromas. What could that be? We come to find out that this awesome place not only carries an entire wall of freshly dried leaf teas (more selections than I knew existed) but roasts their own coffee beans. I wanted a hot coffee, but considering the temperature, I went with a frozen caramel creme coffee. The barista was awesome, she answered all of our questions about which ones she liked the best and why. She seemed excited to be of help, which in this town I've found to be a rarity. The rest of my party got smoothies, which were all very good, but the best were the orange creme and the butter rum smoothie. I will definitely be returning there to try more flavors and maybe be adventurous and buy some tea!"
1,"I've had coffee and tea in the north and south, and on the east and west coasts, and Prestogeorge is among the best in the country.\n\n(Side note: The make some pretty damn good sammiches too!)\n\nNot only is the selection of coffee and loose leaf teas to be marveled at, but the staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Coffee is available in just about any grind. Prices of both coffees and teas are extremely reasonable. Although the line can be long, it is not because of a lack of service - only a large volume of faithful clients. 10 times out of 10, I would go out of my way for Prestogeorge coffees and teas. For nearly 10 years, and in three different states, I continued to order from Prestogeorge online.\n\nStop going to Starbucks. Quit buying crappy coffee at the grocery store.\n\nGo to Prestogeorge!"
1,"This is, by far, one of my favorite places in the Strip District! My favorite tea is the China Rose tea, which not only has a beautiful look to it, but has a wonderful taste! The Apple Caramel Almond is also very good, complete with halved almonds! The milk oolong tea is a little more pricey, but tastes almost like buttery popcorn! It is so unique and exquisite. There are so many coffees and teas to choose from that you could get lost all day just smelling the coffees and choosing which ones you want to take home! You can buy tea pots and infusers here to accompany your new loose leaf teas if you need something new or want to try different ways to drink tea. The prices are absolutely phenomenal. Depending on the tea, for about 2 oz of loose leaf teas or coffee, you are looking at a minimum of $1 and some change! The space is small, so it can be overwhelming when it's busy, but once the crowd dies down, you can really take your time and enjoy the coffees and teas without feeling rushed. Definitely check out this place, you won't be disappointed!"
1,"Their coffee and tea are the best in the burgh! I love watching the coffee roasting in the back. Also, I usually do not enjoy flavored coffee, but I have loved many varieties that I have bought here. Definitely worth a visit while in the Strip District!"
1,"came here for the weekend brunch. really good, but i wasn't too impressed w/ my entree (the pasta trio - the broccoli one was kind of watery, tasted like it was seasoned only w/ salt, and then i didnt like the ravioli at all, the cheese was too smelly for me and then the linguini was alrite but also kind of watery)\n\ni REALLY liked the butter that came w/ the bread - 3 kinds, crunchy sugar or something, apricot and strawberry; the appetizer table was really good too - caesar salad yummy, cured meats, soup was bleh, but it was a good variety and all you can eat\n\nthe desserts also were really good. had cookies, tangerine panna cotta, tiramisu (which everyone kept snatching up so if you see it, just grab it even if youre not ready for dessert), this brownie thing was REALLY good also. the almond cake wasn't as moist as i would have hoped... \n\nmy bf got the gnocchi w/ duck and that was really good. a LOT in terms of portion size\n\n$24 1 entree and all you can eat appetizer and dessert. pretty good deal! but not your every-weekend brunch place"
1,"Just about my fave restaurant in the burgh.\n\nYou can't go wrong at Lidia's, whether you go for Sunday brunch or a nice evening out. It's Italian food worth going out for, friendly staff, and a beautiful space in the strip."
1,"I want the pasta trio in ma' belly now! It's hands down the best dish you can get there. Three deeeeliscious pasta's served to you in a never ending skillet! What other wimpy pasta's can compete with that? The OG (short for Olive Garden) doesn't hold a spaghetti noodle to this place! \n\nI swear you to you I haven't seen the same noodle twice here. They always seem to serve up a dish with some crazy looking pasta that they say the name of and I can never remember. But obviously the best thing about it is the sauce! Oh, the sauce! Meat sauce, sweet sauce, lemon, butter, the list goes on and on. I'll never forget the first time I fell in the love there. I fell in love with this out of this world pumpkin ravioli. I'll never forgot you pumpkin ravioli, NEVER! (This was all said looking wistfully out the window like in a movie montage). \n\nBut don't fear if you need something other than pasta (I don't know why, but let's roll with it). I attended a party there once and we had a a three course meal. First we had a delish caesar salad, which was on the lemony side, just the way I like it! Then we had a choice between meats and a fish and I tried the fillet. It was...to. Die. For! I was very pleasantly surprised that my non-pasta meal was so utterly satisfying. Then came the light and fluffy tiramisu. Now I was officially in heaven! We were also sent home with a goodie bag that included Lidia's Eggplant Pasta Sauce. I tried it a couple days later and it was great! It's a red sweet sauce with a tiny kick to it. I loved that it had eggplant in it because it was something different than your normal meatie balls and sauce combination. \n\nAnd lastly, the ambiance is very unique. There's huge windows in the front to gaze out at well, a parking lot. But they're tinted so you have a nice intimate vibe going on. There's also a huge glass Chihuly chandelier hanging in the middle of the restaurant that's gorge! So please, convert over from the OG, you will not be disappointed. And don't worry, they DO give free bread sticks!"
1,"as a big fan of Lidia's, i was anxious to eat at her restaurant, and it was totally awesome. would highly recommend.  Food was excellent. wait staff was attentive. we arrived early for our reservation and they were able to seat us.  it was a lot of fun and the decor was awesome too."
1,"We absolutely LOVED this restaurant!  The service was impeccable!  I had the all you can eat pasta trio which was lovely and delicious!  My husband had the cacciatore, which he makes himself at home, and he said it was the best he'd ever had!  We will definitely be back!"
1,"I've been a huge fan of Lidia Bastianich for years, watching her show on PBS and cooking her recipes. My Dad is a huge fan as well. I recently moved back to Pittsburgh (after 30 years) to help out my folks as my Dad's cancer has worsened. I had no idea Lidia had a restaurant here. About a month ago I met a college friend (and foodie) at the strip for drinks and we ended up at Lidia's. Bar is awesome - I highly recommend the white Manhattans. While I was there I found out Lidia would be in town for a special dinner, Nov. 7. Woot! Gonna go and bring my Mom and Dad.\n\nSo happy I could make my reservation online! The restaurant was very professional and called to confirm (beating me to call them) and then accommodated us with a table closer to the door so my Dad, who has a walker, would not have to walk so far.\n\nSaid table was very cozy against the wall, the arrangement was perfect. The greeting and seating staff were excellent and friendly. My Mom and Dad bought her latest cook in anticipation. Upon seating, Lidia was bee bopping around and we said hello and she promised to come back to visit.\n\nThe meal, the MEAL! Yum, holy moly! To start, I had a white Manhattan, of course, and enjoyed the yummy bread-sticks. I also ate some of the homemade bread (one was rosemary I think) with pesto butter and a bean butter. Had to save room! We did not order wine, my Dad can't drink wine due to his medication. The meal was paired with Lidia's own wine, another time I would love to try some. Since I was driving I only had one cocktail. ; p\n\nThe antipasti - squash and ricotta tart was to die for, the mozzarella and celery salad was wonderful. For Primi, my Mom had Lidia's signature Ceasar salad, my Dad had the tomato and ricotta crostini. I had the ricotta and vegetable crostata with arugula salad. I loved mine, the crostata again so excellent, the arugula salad was warm served on a warm plate. Had a bite of my parent's Primi. It's always good to go with others, so you can share and try out more dishes!\n\nThe pasta was Ravioli verde with sage butter - delectable! The ravioli looked more like beautiful speckled green meatballs and melted in your mouth.\n\nFor Secondi, I had Lidia's Pasta trio, my favorite of which was the homemade pappardelle with cabbage and meat sauce. My Dad had the pork shanks braised in apple cider vinegar and barley risotto (my other choice) and my Mom had the lamb chops with red wine sauce and spinach spaetzle. The pork was luscious and the lamb chops were delicious too.\n\nDolci was outstanding as well, my parents had the Grandma Rose's apple cake with candied walnuts (those were awesome - they were coated with a marzipan type coating). I had the Caprese Torte which was chocolate and divine. All served with a dollop of mascarpone ice cream, so good!\n\nLidia came back over and chatted for awhile with my Dad (and my Mom and me) and signed their cookbook. They talked about cooking and where in Italy they are from and the slovak influence of their youth. Her's in far north Italy, his in a coal town in PA with Italian and Slovak neighbors. Magical.\n\nThe service was superb. The only sour notes were the din of the restaurant (everyone was excited!) and the \""bull in the china shop\"" busboy (man). He actually splashed matter into my Dad's eye piling dishes and utensils on his arm busing the table next to us. It was fine, no harm, no foul and he was very nice, as was everyone on staff.\n\nI can't wait to go back!"
1,"We visited for brunch last Sunday. It was amazing. It is $28 a person and includes a prefix menu. You get a morning cocktail, antipasto buffet, choice of entree (endless fresh made pasta trio is an option) and a dessert buffet. \n\nThe serve was impeccable. The sangria and Bloody Mary were delicious. The pasta trio was incredible. The salads at the buffet were so thoughtful and tasty. Would go again! I want to make this place a tradition. \n\nGreat management! Excellent food!"
1,"Great food and service, very pleased with my Valentine's day dinner here.  Planning to come back to try more of their fare, since their Valentine's day menu was limited."
1,"Oh yum!!!\n\nAfter a VERY stressful week this week Lidia's was a wonderful oasis on a Thursday night. Our server (Robert) was a breath of fresh air in his knowledge and love of food.\n\nHAVE THE BURRATA!  No, I am not kidding. It was so good that it just about brought my coworker to tears. :) All of food was wonderful and it was refreshing that a restaurant would let us sit and enjoy our food. After a wonderful three hours at Lidia's we eventually made our way back to the hotel (with a tiramisu to go)."
1,I order food for delivery at my hotel. I got the chicken carbonara.  It came with salad and toast it was the BOMB. It was delivered piping hot and it was a lot of food I ordered he individual size and its enough for two people.  I also got slice of strawberry cheesecake.
1,Traditional pizza is awesome. Delivery is very fast as well. They always tell me 40 minutes and then arrive in 15-20.
1,"My husband and I just moved here from the NYC area and we've been looking for a good pizza place. After trying a few different sub-par Pittsburgh pizzerias, we decided to try Ephesus last Friday night. We ordered one large spinach and feta pizza and one Italian calzone, via delivery. Even though it was prime-time on a Friday night, our pizza was delivered in 40 minutes and both things we ordered were DELICIOUS. The crust on the pizza was perfectly chewy and crusty, and the toppings were perfect. I think we've found our new pizza place!"
1,"I feel like I need a shower after I eat a Peppi's sandwich, but in a good way.\n\nPeppi's subs are so good I need profanity to fully express how good they are.\n\nGo get a Peppi's sandwich bc you need one.  Not hungry?  Excuse not valid, you need one.\n\nDid you know I can unhinge my jaw and swallow things whole?   I didnt either, until I had Peppi's.\n\nAre you hung over?  Peppi's has HEALING POWERS and will cure your hangover!\n\nAlso, since I'm among friends here I will make a confession.  I do not care for Primanti's.  Somehow thats like telling people you didn't like the Godfather.  I do not like Primanti's, and Peppi's is my favorite \""Pittsburgh\"" sandwich.\n\nI've Peppi'd on the North Side, Dahntahn, and in the Strip District.  They're all good.  I get the Italian, and I love the dressing they put on the sandwich.\n\nNow I want Peppi's and its only 9:30 in the morning.  Damn.\n\nJust go eat at Peppi's.  You'll realize this review is just pure truth.  It's delicious, and greasy, and good."
1,"Wow. Stayed back in November and what a hotel! The architecture of this building is amazing on the outside and the inside. When you walk towards the elevators, it feels like you're in some swanky European Boutique. This place feels first class all the way, but had a pretty fair nightly rate to go along. You could easily walk to a Pirates or Steelers game. Spend the extra dough and get a room with a river view. Amazing!"
1,Lovely hotel experience. Great location in Pittsburgh. The staff were super friendly and helpful and were WAY nice when I left my phone charger in the room after checkout. Our flight was leaving hours after we checked out and they locked up our bags. Went to a wedding here and the food was great and all the facilities were well maintained. I was delightfully surprised.
1,Easter Brunch. One word sums it up Outstanding. The food was great. Not as many choices as The Grand Concours but as good if not better. The service was top notch. Their reservation schedule was well spaced. \nLines almost non existent . A little pricey at 39.99 but worth the extra just not to have to stand in line at the various serving stations. Would go back again.
1,Just spent two nights here and we thought it was very nice. Lobby is beautiful. We stayed on one of the floors hat they are renovating and it was done very sharply and with good taste. Ask for higher floors to minimize noise from outside.
1,"I stayed here for a business trip and it was absolutely wonderful. The staff was beyond helpful even for the tiniest requests (like bringing me a mini bar key when I didn't want to move!). The beds are insanely comfortable and the view in both min and a coworkers rooms were gorgeous. If I wasn't going home, I wouldn't want to leave! \n\nAlso there's complimentary and premium wifi but I had no problem with the complimentary!"
1,I love this place.  I am getting married here in July.  I've been a hotel guest a few times and the service is just fantastic.  The staff knows exactly what to do to make it an enjoyable stay.  The breakfast on the top floor was awesome.  Can't wait until July!  Maybe I should write an update in a few months?
1,"The Renaissance Pittsburgh is an excellent place to stay. The rooms are spacious. The beds are very comfortable. The staff were all very helpful and pleasant. I was here for a conference with breakfast and lunch provided. The food was good and the dining room was beautiful with an amazing view of Heinz Field, Allegheny River and bridges. Braddock's American Brasserie is situated inside the hotel. The food was amazing! Would definitely stay here again. There's a parking deck across the street that's $5/day. Some kind of increase during special events but I wasn't here during any games. Valet at the hotel is $30/day and they park your car in that same deck."
1,"This is a pretty awesome hotel. Rooms are super clean, service is super good. The beds are really comfy. Internet speed is fast enough to stream Netflix. Downtown and close to some good restaurants. I wish all hotels could have this level as the baseline."
1,"I was in town for the night on a business mission.  My co-worker, who is a Marriott awards member, wanted to stay here.  What a great hotel.  It is an older building with lots of charm, elegance, and appeal.  I loved their staircase in the foyer.  The hotel was so beautifully decorated from the moment you walked in.  The location of the hotel is fantastic.  Close to restaurants, shopping, and the stadiums across the river.  \n\nWe had no idea we would be walking into a magnificent evening sponsored by the hotel for its rewards members.   A carving station of prime rib, homemade short rib perogi's, open bar, a sushi bar, and a huge table of fresh desserts consisting of cookies, brownies, and pastries.  It was all complimentary and the food was outstanding.  \n\nThe room was spacious, clean, and updated to an extent.   The shower needed some upkeep.   My room had a great view of the city and river.  Customer service was fantastic.   Our check in person was friendly, professional, and caring about my stay.  Every employee we made contact with was a pleasure to deal with and happy to be there.  Most importantly, I forgot my eye glasses in my room and didn't realize it until I got home.  I called housekeeping and they had found  them.  They sent them out promptly and I received them a couple days later.  \n\nI don't know if I would think about staying anywhere else in Pittsburgh.  My rate was very reasonable for its location and quality of stay."
1,"No one is better at anthropomorphizing their pet than I am.  No one.  I religiously check the ingredients of the food that Gus eats, I wake up at absurd hours in the morning during the summer so his walk isn't too hot, and he has this crazy dog seat/throne in the back seat of my car so he can look out the window.  You've all heard of helicopter parenting, yeah?  It's a mess and screwing up today's children, but I'm totally guilty of helicopter doggie parenting.\n\nAll of which is to say that I'm not going to drop Gus off at some random place while I go to work.  \n\nStep 1 (which I think the other reviewer skipped/missed): call them and make an appointment.  Taking a strange dog into a place full of dogs is a little dicey.  Typically, new dogs are brought over on Saturday (when there are no other dogs around) so Barbara can get a sense of its temperament.  Barbara is great with dogs and has a ton of experience, but I totally had the, \""well, if my kid isn't good enough for them, screw them!\"" thoughts running through my head.  Obviously, Barbara instantly saw the inherent awesomeness of Gus.\n\nStep 2: learn to let go.  I don't have kids, but I imagine this is pretty much the same as dropping them off at daycare.  The first few times, they scream and cry when you leave and you're left feeling like a terrible person for the rest of the day.  Then one day, magically, they're excited to go to daycare (or Bow WoW) and they don't even look back while they're led away to the playroom.  It's a bittersweet moment, but one can't help but feel a little proud.  See what I mean about the anthropomorphizing thing?\n\nBow Wow separates the dogs by size and organizes the day into blocks of play, rest, and exercise so the dogs don't get overstimulated, which can cause stress.  The staff is excellent about communicating with owners about even minor changes in your dog's behavior and simply giving you updates about how your dog's socialization and adjustment.  I think I spent the first 2-3 weeks asking, \""Is he playing?  Is he making friends?\"" on a daily basis.  The entire staff was very good about humoring me.\n\nGus loves it there (his radar triggers around 21st street and he starts to flip out in the car) and I feel safe about leaving him there.  And honestly, when it comes to a doggie day care, that's all that matters."
1,"Best doggie daycare in the city. We've been taking our dog here for over a year and we couldn't be happier. The staff is so knowledgeable and really cares about each and every dog. It's a good feeling to know that our dog is being watched by trained dog handlers, not teenagers who are too busy texting. If we ever have a question, the staff at Bow Wow are the first ones we ask as they are so knowledgeable about training, dog health, dog tips, etc. They go the extra mile to make sure they reinforce the training that we have spend a lot of time developing with our dog. I definitely recommend Bow Wow!"
1,There is no place I would trust more with my best buddy. They take amazing care of her and love her like their own!
1,"Yes the beds are comfy and all that... but creature comforts aren't what merit the 5 stars.  A human does.\nHer name is Nasiba.  She's a housekeeper, and she made the room sparkle.  There's no geiger counter that can measure the TLC put into a tautly-tucked bed sheet, but if there were... it'd be spiking in Nasiba's rooms.\nI tracked her down and met her in the hallway, and we had a nice chat.  She's a delight.  She's Turkish, and was a refugee in Russia, but apparently they didn't exactly roll out the red carpet.  She smiles (and melts your heart) when she tells you in her still-being-honed English \""but I came to America seven years ago, and America took me in.  I became a citizen three years ago.  I am American now.\""  Big smile.  Man oh man, in people like her (hard-working and affectionate toward her new home) you see, and revel in the fact, that we are indeed a nation of immigrants.  She took the time to do it right.  And it's moving.  I told her we're very glad she's here.\nPlus, she has a little American flag in her huge cart.  And that made me smile.\nShe gets the Unsung Award of the day."
1,"Everything was perfect about my stay here. The moment you step out of your vehicle you are greeted by friendly and helpful staff. The room was super clean and nicely decorated, spectacular river view over looking the Pittsburgh skyline, Heinz Field and PNC Park. Best part..The room was very quiet, ultra deluxe beds that was heavenly and the complimentary hot chocolate and marshmallows that was waiting in our room after a chilly evening stroll where all nice touches. Can't beat the location, we where within walking distance of many great restaurants, bars, shopping and public transportation. Amazing hotel! Super sweet staff. Will definitely stay here again the next time we are in Pittsburgh."
1,"I'm glad I listened to my friend's recommendation and not some of these bad reviews. We're just in town for the night and wanted something delivered to our hotel. They said it would take an hour, which I expected on Super Bowl Sunday right at game time, but it was here in less than half an hour. \n\nThe pizza was delicious! Just the right balance of cheese and a tasty sauce, generous with the toppings, and a nicely crispy crust but not too thin."
1,"A great neighborhood bar in the strip with authentic tasting Irish pub food. I'm a fan of going early (though it's so empty and lonely looking early in the day) for a brunch of bangers, rashers, and mash. Inventive cocktails, and events (on their calendar) are some high points. The bathrooms stick out in your mind though, because they're down some narrow stairs and seemingly so far away they might as well be in a different building. And they may be."
1,"Harp & Fiddle is the gem in Pittsburgh's strip district.  They have several beers on tap, great food, and a nice, relaxed atmosphere.  The staff is especially pleasant and very friendly.  H&F is an excellent place for the end of the work week.  They have nightly specials during happy hour Which lasts from 5pm to 7pm. H&F also has live bands playing nightly.  The acts range from up tempo rock music to laid back acoustic guitar acts.  Overall, H&F has something for everyone and is an awesome place to go for good beer and good times with the people you love to be around."
1,"Food was great, service outstanding. We had a very large group and our food came within short time. The waitress kept the drinks coming. Service was superb!\nThe Fish fry is HUGE!!!! so bring an empty stomach or share it! It so good! \nI recommend the reuben rolls (never heard of before), if you aren't hungry enough for a reuben sandwich. So good, I am thinking about them now... sitting at home.\nLive music was OUTSTANDING!!! Crossing Celtic, you rocked!!!!"
1,"This is my favorite spot in Pittsburgh!!This was the first time i drank grass tea,and it was pretty god.and the food was spicy and yummy.\n  We went there on a Saturday,walking through the busy streets the name did catch my eye,and i still pronounce it in a funny way as-\""My Nockh\""(Try the nasal sound,its funny)\n   Its a simple place with simple people and great food:) \n-Smriti"
1,"I visited PA in 2012, where I stayed for a month. During that time, I stumbled upon this little gem when the hotel offered me some menus from around the area. I took a shot on China House and was so unbelievably surprised by the food. It was easily the best Chinese food I've ever eaten, and that's saying a lot, as Chinese is, without a doubt, my favorite cuisine, so I've eaten it a lot in my life. the boneless ribs were the juiciest, most tender boneless ribs I've ever had; the rice was superb, and the egg rolls were amazing. It was so good, I wound up eating there numerous times in that month I was there, and still today, I find myself comparing it to the Chinese food here in Miami where I live. Still have not found any that comes close to PA's China House. My father felt the same way, and when he learned he might have to go back to PA in Sept, he taunted me with how he was going to the China House, it was that amazing! On a final note, it was so good, I made sure to bring back a menu from there so I wouldn't forget where it was, in case I go back."
1,China House is my new go to Chinese take out restaurant in Pittsburgh ever since yen's closed up and then changed hands. \n\nKeep in mind it's a take out place. You're not expecting to get gourmet food on gold lined plates - you're getting tasty food in plastic containers and not eating there. (There's only two tables)\n\nWith that in mind it's great. Big portions and I've never been let down. Sometimes you get free stuff too. Coupons for 10% off and free soda.
1,"This is the strangest place, but I love it!  From the outside, I would guess this place used to be a funeral home.  It's very strangely decorated on the inside.  The main dining room is a weird pink and green, extremely dated and in the middle of the room, there is this huge odd fake flower display.\n\nThat said, the food is super yummy!  They give bunches of samples while you are waiting.  The wait staff is really nice.  I had the filet mignon and it was amazing.  Others at the table got different items, and I tried a little bit of everything.  All very good.  The menu is really strange, and like another said, there is no theme.  But, everything sounds good.\n\nI have never been a huge fan of the Pittsburgh dining scene, but I really like this place despite its odd decor.  Skip the faux fancy pants places and try this.  (Oh and it's also very reasonably priced)."
1,"Great experience. Staff was quite attentive and seemed to genuinely care about our experience. Allowed us to sample a couple appetizers. Most of the items we had for dinner (appetizers, entrees and dessert)"
1,We have not been to this restaurant in quite sometime. What a great lunch menu. Highly recommend checking out.
1,"One of two places to check out whenever I'm in Pittsburgh. For such a small space, Paul's is incredibly dense. They have this unique carding procedure where they keep all the new CDs behind the counter and you bring the card up to the counter to get it. They usually have an amazing used CD selection as well. Plus, they have MOJO and UNCUT magzines flown in from the UK and you can usually get them about a month before Borders does! On most days Paul himself will be there. They are also very plugged into the local scene, as far as what they carry. I rarely leave here without a few amazing finds!"
1,"Paul's is my favorite record shop in town! \n\nAs others have noted--it's not a big place, but it is chock full of (well-organized!) stuff! They have a wide variety of music and the staff is very knowledgeable and friendly.  They know about *music,* not just one variety and they've never been condescending or rude. If they don't have something you're looking for in stock, they'll gladly order it for you, and they were very helpful when I was trying to find out whether an old jazz record had been reissued on CD. \n\nIf I can't buy my CDs straight from the band, Paul's is where I go."
1,"Support this local business.  Good food, nice lady on the phone, and quick delivery. YUM! Never been to the actual restaurant, but i'm sure it's awesome."
1,"One of the best hoagies I have ever had. Warm and toasted. Great mayo. Large serving. Soft drinks are refillable. The 1980's atmosphere is not too impressive, but this is just a pizza shop. Great place to bring out of town guests. I will be back again and can't wait to try the Sicilian pizza.\n\nI got mayo on the hoagie and was excellent, now I know why... It has a garlic flavor and I love garlic."
1,"Sometimes I like to stop into a pizza place for one slice of pizza.  I have found that the places with the best pizza have \""horrible horrible\"" individual slices.  The slices have often been sitting for a long time.  Then if the individual slices are reheated, it still is not quite right.  Then often these individual slices have a very limit amount of cheese and toppings.  Angelo's does not do this.  There individual slices are the BEST!!!!  Everytime I get one slice of pizza at Angelo's it is always pippin' HOT.  It has that just made t.  They are very generous with their toppings on the individual slices. Plus, their individual slices are huge.  I always get them to cut that one slice into two.  I tried to eat half of my slice at the shop and then take the other half home for later.  Their pizza is so delicious the other half often does not make it home."
1,I haven't been here yet but after reading about the Bikes Before Christmas project here http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08311/925595-94.stm I just want to go here and buy some bike stuff.\nMore about Bikes Before Christmas here - http://iheartpgh.com/2008/11/06/donate-bikes-for-kids/
1,"Easily the best bike shop in Pittsburgh.\n\nLet me qualify that by saying if you are looking for a $12,000 Carbon Triathlon bike this probably isn't the shop...\n\nIt is, however, THE SHOP if you are looking to work on your bike for free.  Gerry has 6 fully equipped stations in the back where he will let you work on your bike for free.\n\nAny part is available, at less than full list prices.  It really doesn't get any better than this."
1,"Kraynick's is a real gem for Pittsburgh.  This isn't the place to take your high-end carbon frame bike, but Jerry will help you get your commuter, beater, or frame you found trashed in a ditch in the woods back on the road.  (Seriously, there was a guy in there salvaging an old MTB frame he found in a ditch in the woods.)  Be forewarned: he's pretty typical of a lot of old school Pittsburghers: very gruff at first, but actually a nice guy when he warms up to you.\n\nI haven't had a bike in ten years and decided out of nowhere to build one around an old frame and a new internal gear hub.  I bought a few high-end components online and the rest from Jerry.  Despite bringing in outside parts, Jerry was still gushing with help, and, after several weeks and 3-4 visits, I'm riding a bike that I built from scratch after going in with no mechanical knowledge of bikes at all.  \n\nHe doesn't carry new super-high-end components, but the stuff he does carry is solid, and he has every weird bracket or screw or cable guide you can imagine from decades of scrounging parts.  He can help you with any weird setup you want.  (Mine's definitely out-of-the-ordinary.)\n\nOne warning: this is your standard old Pittsburgh small business, so he doesn't take credit cards.  It's a little annoying considering that you might be spending over $100 on parts and service, but there's an ATM down the block."
1,"The best pizza in Pittsburgh, hands down.  6 stars for the pizza, n/a for the other food, 4-star decent beer selection for the size of the place, 2 star for the prices, 5 stars for the owner, 2 stars for the employees/service, 5 stars for timeliness. When it comes down to it I rate take-out and delivery places mostly based on food taste because I am not going elsewhere for superior service and inferior food, so Graziano's gets 5 stars by my standards. I have friends who visit from out of town who order it to take home. It's that good. Don't be fooled by the single slices though, as it seems they use a different recipe for them (they kinda suck). Go for the large plain or extra cheese. Perfecta!"
1,I love these kind of barbershops.  Straight out of a Twilight Zone time warp. especially  the prices.  Very friendly (Pittsburgh is a friendly town to begin with.)  Quick cut.  Very nice if what you want is basic.
1,Best palak paneer. Hands down.did a palak paneer test a few years agos.. included graphs and etc... still have my heart. the spicey could be spicier.. ill just throw that out there....
1,local treasure. i'm in love with this place. 7 dollar lunch buffet (always a mistake unless you plan on sleeping the rest of your day) and byob. recommended!
1,"Prices are excellent, food is EVEN BETTER. I am a vegetarian, and found the selection and quality to be just as good as Indian restaurants charging double the price. I attend a convention annually in Pittsburgh, and \""People's\"" will definitely be on the \""must visit\"" list for future years."
1,"I, straight up, love Pho Minh. This is one of those places that I would go to every day if I could. I love Vietnamese food, and have tried it in a fair number of cities. This was by far better than the best Vietnamese in Boston (Xinh Xinh) and a close second to the best Vietnamese in Seattle (Pho Bac). \n\nI found Pho Minh, sort of on accident, my first trip to Pittsburgh. The owners were very kind and attentive. The food was delicious, fresh, everything was clean. The pho broth was the best I've ever had, delicately spiced and flavorful. They don't pre-cook the beef, which is excellent, so it doesn't become too chewy (it cooks in the broth). The second time we went to Pho Minh was the first night we got to Pittsburgh when we moved (this should tell you how excited we were). Coming from Boston, it didn't occur to us that it might be closing at 9pm. We got there at 9:15pm and they kindly asked if we wanted them to make us up some food to go. Even that was good.\n\nWe kept hearing, over and over again, that Tram's was freaking fantastic and we should go there instead. So we did. It was a mistake. I have no idea what everyone is talking about. The ambiance? What ambiance? It smelled like urine. Seriously. \n\nNeedless to say, Pho Minh for life."
1,"Best place for pho in the city. I have tried them all and this is the one I always come back to for more. The woman who takes your order is quick and abrupt, but she is very friendly once you get to know her. I love the little old man who seats you when you come in the door, and serves you tea. You have to ask for water if you want it. I love the tofu in lemongrass curry as an appetizer. The sauce is so good I wish I could put it on everything. I usually get pho with chicken or the special\nSpicy soup. The ingredients are always so fresh and just taste so healthy. The food is very flavorful and perfect after a weekend of riding my snowboard. If you are looking for authentic pho then this is the place to go!"
1,"Occasionally, when we couldn't get to the Cat Clinic on Saw Mill Run, I've taken TaiChi Kitty to this location on Liberty.\n\nSame great vet service, same great staff that loves and cares for kitty cats.\n\nAlthough this location was a little out of our way, the parking (all street parking) was definitely better than the Saw Mill Run parking options.\n\nSix of one or a half dozen of the other.\n\nTaiChi Kitty was always satisfied, either way.  \n\n\""Just get me home momma!\"""
1,"This is a vet for cats, not a vet for people. This staff is going to do what is best for your cat, make recommendations for the benefit of your cat, and that may not always be the most convenient thing for you, as a human person. However, if you love your cat(s), this is the place to be. \n\nOne of my cats is extremely nervous in public situations, but always calms around the Dr. here. The doctor seems to talk to the cat in some secret mystical cat language. There is a real sense of cat community, from the portraits of the clinic's cats, to the bulletin board with cat-related notices, to the high-quality toys and treats for sale. \n\nAnother of our cats went to the great litterbox in the sky at this office. This is a horrible, difficult, awful thing to live through. I miss him terribly every day, even though it has been years. I am very grateful that the Cat Clinic & their wonderful staff was there for us. I am not sure that any other vet would have held me and said comforting things while I sobbed, taken phone calls from my friend, and provided such solid E for Effort. \n\nI have always felt like we have received the best possible service here. Even though they are a bit more expensive than \""budget\"" vets around town, the experience here has always been worth every penny. The peace of mind that comes from knowing you are doing the best by your pet is priceless to me. Cats don't have voices and cats can't make their own decisions about their health."
1,"The food is great. The employees are friendly, helpful and curteous. The place is spotless- always. You can get a great hot lunch. The menu selection varies from day to day. But it's always very good. And they make frozen dinners you can take home and cook. Everything about this place is much better than Donatellis. What's not to love?"
1,"I consider myself a lucky girl to live in Pittsburgh's own Little Italy (although it has taken it's toll on my waist line, truth be told). Two separate and delicious family owned Italian grocery stores and countless amazing restaurants.\n\nGroceria Italiana is one of those quintessential corner stores that make you think of the way things may have been when your parents were young.\n\nIf you're one of those on the go-doing a million things at once types who rarely find the time to cook a meal, look no further than the hot food options they offer. It's that perfect delicious comfort food that these up coming autumn days.\n\nSkip out of work early and make a pit stop here on your way home, you'll thank me later."
1,"What can I say about Groceria Italiana that hasn't already been said? \nPLEASE OPEN ANOTHER LOCATION! The south hills needs a place like this. If I didn't live so gosh darn far away, I'd be here multiple times a week. \nI stopped back to Groceria Italiana after a food tour in Bloomfield a few weeks ago to pick up a few things for dinner. I decided to purchase the special- sausage ravioli because the owner had informed us that everything is made in house. Even the suasage is ground and tested in house before putting into the ravioli. I also left with marinara sauce and pepperoni bread. \nThe pepperoni bread was light, fluffy and delicious. \nThe ravioli is easily the best ravioli I have ever had. Each little pocket of heaven was hand made and was slightly different in shape and size from each other. The tall tale sign that they were pressed by hand. We followed the directions on the box and BAKED (not boiled) them in sauce. I've literally thought about those ravioli every time I have had italian food since. If you are anywhere near this place, stop in immediately!"
1,My review will be short and sweet.  I AGREE with everything everybody had to say about this wonderful little Italian store in Bloomfield.  I hate grocery shopping (especially big store grocery shopping like Giant Eagle) but love to shop in this lovely little store.  Prepared foods are fantastic and the lunchmeats are always fresh and delicious.  I always manage to find everything I need here.  I am Italian and grew up with grocery stores just like this.  I feel like I am home every time I enter.
1,"I love this place! So far I've been there twice for pepperoni rolls, once for pizza crust and pizza sauce, and another time to grab some frozen ravioli. Everything has been super tasty, especially the pepperoni rolls that everyone have been raving about. We got the prosciutto ravioli to cook at home and it was tasty! I would also recommend buying pizza crust here because it's super cheap and much better than any store bought crust. Some of the prices are high (I think it was $8 for ravioli), but you do get a good amount and everything is legit so I think it's worth it! They also have a meat/cheese counter and a small menu of hot prepared foods ready to go!"
1,"Years ago I discovered this quaint grocer and their awesome lunch counter. The meatball hoagie and weeding soup are seriously are amazing and authentic. I have not had better wedding soup in the city. I'm also in love with the homemade raviolis, (read the directions, these are baked not boiled.) My favorite is the artichoke gorgonzola, they are often sold out. If you're lucky enough, you'll get a chance to see the raviolis being made in action by one of the lovely pasta making ladies. Make certain to use the homemade sauce as well, we're talking heavenly good. Also, if you get there early enough, grab a warm, fresh Tuscan bread, (but maybe I shouldn't be telling you this.) it's crispy on the outside, and warm and soft on the inside. I dream of this bread. The deli counter is as well fantastic, get some meats and cheeses and have a banging sandwich. Anything you try from here is sure to keep you coming back for more!"
1,"This is a great PNC branch! Everyone is friendly, courteous, and knowledgeable about the services that they can offer.\n\nAsk for Maryanne. She's been with PNC for 35 years and is a real delight to work with.\n\nEvery time I walk in this branch, I feel proud to be a PNC client!"
1,"There are two Indian restaurants pretty close to each other: Taste of India and People's. People's has better appetizers, and of course they have 1/2 off during certain hours, but Taste of India is better by far at entrees, and their masala tea is delicious. The nan is always hot, like hot hot, steaming hot, burn your hands hot, and perfectly done. \n\nChicken Tikka Masala leftovers are sitting in the fridge right now, calling my name. Everything is good and the portions are beyond generous. What is particularly striking is the pricing. Indian food in Orlando and DC tends to be expensive, and those are my frames of reference, but Taste of India is completely reasonable. Even bizarrely inexpensive considering the quality of the food you get.\n\nThe store front is odd, and the place never looks open, but don't be discouraged from going. Once you walk in you'll be seated quickly and served an onion and a mint chutney. Generally there is a young kid in the far back table playing on a computer or GameBoy.\n\nAt the end of the meal, your tip tray comes covered in an anise and sugar mixture with little pink, yellow, and white pellet things. I'm an addict, but always end up eating one pinch more than I ought, where the flavor becomes unappealing. And as much as I know this, I cannot help myself."
1,"That woman that you see in the corner, a table full of food? Yeah - that's me. Don't judge....  I lose all ability to think rationally when I cross through the door. 4 entrees, biryani and a samosa? Yes. Why not? How can I possibly be expected to choose between such flavorful and reasonably priced food? It's the culinary equivalent of Sophie's Choice.\n\nThe staff is wonderful, the food is terrific - get the Samosas, saag paneer and dal makhni. Oh, and the tikka masala. And the muglai korma.\nOr you could do the lunch buffet and save your dignity. But then you wouldn't have leftovers for lunch. And - trust me - you'll want leftovers for lunch."
1,"This place knocked me out.\n\nI had garlic naan and the lamb Shahajahani.  The sauce was so good, I used all the naan to sop it up.  (The waiter told me it was OK to do that.  Not sure if it really was, but I don't care.  I wasn't gonna leave any.)\n\nI travel a lot, and enjoy finding little places like this that are inconspicuous, where you can get great food, great service at a really decent price.  I had what I described above, plus a half-carafe of their house wine (not spectacular, but who cares) for $29, tip included.  And it was a good tip.\n\nThe server was very friendly and helpful and took time to help select the best choice for what I was in the mood for. And, he thanked me about six times for coming in, which was really refreshing.\n\nThis beats Indian I've had in Boston, New York and Berlin.  Will definitely be back on next trip to Pittsburgh."
1,"Jordan & I have been eating Taste of India at CMU for a while, without knowing it was Taste of India.  At CMU they offer super inexpensive lunches that are more filling than anywhere else to eat at lunch. During this winter break, we have been going through some serious withdraw while the cafe is closed.\n\nThank you YELPERS once again, in our search to satiate our curry addiction, we have found our distributor!  We were excited to read that this restaurant supplied our weekly lunches and we ordered!!\n\nI ordered the Alu Matar Mushroom at a spicy rating of 3 (yes, I'm a sissy), but it was EXACTLY what I wanted!!  Jordan ordered Alu Gobhi which was cauliflower & potato at a spicy rating of 5.  We truly weren't sure how to scale our tolerance; but we decided that next time we could both go hotter.\n\nWe also can't wait to try the Lunch Buffet! We really wish we would have known that this existed during the week in between Christmas & New Years when we were fiending for Indian food.  Now that we know, I have no doubt we will soon become regulars.\n\nWe have also tried Tamarind in Oakland, but that place just made my mouth go numb after it was all said and done (and left me with an unpleasant digestion experience).  All of the bad cliche things you hear about Indian food, is nothing like Taste of India.  You can taste the love cooked in."
1,"Darren brought me here, and as a Indian food n00b, I was impressed with everything included in the economical Dinner for Two which gets a diner nan, a meat dish, a veggie dish, dal, a dessert, and tea. The tea and kheer was a nice way to cap off the meal. The mango beef and alu palak were superb. I could live on the bread alone. They look to have renovated the place, and Darren said the bathrooms were much nicer this time around."
1,"I might have just found my favorite Indian place. I went with two friends for a feast and we were not disappointed! We were greeted warmly and told we could sit anywhere.  The space is a little small, but that actually adds to the atmosphere of warm, delicious Indian food, friendly owners and staff, and good friends!\n\nI ordered the Malia Kofta for my entree.  These are vegetable balls with raisins and and almonds in a creamy sauce.  It was out of this world!!!  The veggie balls were slightly crispy on the edges but soft in the middle and packed full of flavor.  The sauce was not too creamy and the raisins added a sweet taste throughout.  Both of my friends have since gone back and ordered this!\n\nI wish I could remember what they ate, but this actually happened a few months ago.  I remember the Malia Kofta like it was yesterday, though!"
1,"This was my first time at taste of India. The service was very pleasant and I found the food and alcoholic beverages to be quite inexpensive. Most importantly, the food was fantastic. The flavors were well balanced and succulent. I will definitely be coming around more often."
1,"Went for the lunch buffet which was about $8. It was SO good! I ate wayy too much but still wanted to eat more! Everything tasted so fresh and delicious! The decor was very tasteful, fresh and Indian inspired. The staff was wonderful too, very nice!"
1,"Writing this review for the all the Laaadies! Mr. B Had come to town for a visit and needed a trim in October. i had passed the Golden Razor on several occasions as it is in my neighborhood. I had a really good feeling about this place even before seeing the results it yielded.\n\nWe were out to run errands and walked inside. Two gentlemen were seated and a lovely man with a thick Italian accent told us he could fit Mr. B in after his next cut. The place reminded me of a small shop that would be located on a tiny street in Naples. One chair running constantly. Tom the barber is very busy and you can see that his clientele is very loyal. The appointment was quick and the atmosphere jolly. The topics of conversation revolving around Italy and current events. I felt like an interloper because I was probably one of the only chicks that ever goes in there. I could tell by the looks I got from the guys coming in. I just smiled and kept up the conversation with Tom and Mr. B. This cut was very simple but he shaped the hair just perfect and when we walked outside I gave Mr. B a kiss and told him he looked marvelous!\n\nOur second visit was mid February. Mr. B was trying to go a little longer with the his hair but it was just looking unkempt. I decided that I liked his hair a little bit on the longer side so after calling and securing an appointment this visit, Mr. B asked my opinion after sitting in the chair. I told Tom I preferred the hair a little more full and not such a close cut. He smiled and kept up a nice chatter with the both of us. A steady stream of calls and locals walking in to make appointments again made the atmosphere so pleasant.  \n\nThis Hair cut was especially fantastic. Mr. B had such a dapper look, I loved the cut and gave him a big hug and kiss then told him how handsome he was. The pricing is also extremely fair. I want to jump up in that chair myself instead of going to yet another salon. Tom also remembered us from our first visit and that is just good people skills! Love, love, love the Golden razor. \n\n* Cash only and give this man a proper tip"
1,"If there were an option to give an extra star for a \""special\"" experience, I would surely do so for Golden Razor. I must confess that I have a really thick beard and my stubble would surely light a match. Well but it did meet its match out here. The shave out here gives me a sense of hope against the injustice of my beard. Also I have been lucky to taste some home made lemoncello from the house of the master himself!"
1,The barber did a double take when I walked in. I had long hair and a beard two weeks old. He did a great job in less than 30 minutes and was very social and pleasant throughout.  The straight razor shave with all the hot towels and other treatments was particularly cool.
1,"I went as a walk-in on a random Wednesday.  Tom was busy, but he squeezed me in.  In about 15 minutes and with very little direction from me I had the tighest fade this side of the Mississippi.  It was pretty neat just to watch him work.  He's truly a master at what he does and I regret every dollar I've ever spent at those bargain \""value\"" chains where the stylists are typically a revolving door of mediocrity.  I challenge you to find a better cut for $14."
1,"Best Damn Haircut Ever. Grade: A+\n\nImma be blunt: Fellas, stop wasting your time & money on talentless hacks (the 99.9% of people who cut hair) & make this guy your regular.\n\nThis guy puts everyone else in the haircutting game to shame. Male, female, gay, straight, black, white, young or old...they all suck compared to this Italian-American dude. He is a true artist & even has a mini-statue of Michelangelo's David next to the chair (a very cool reclining chair) for inspiration or as a reminder that you're going to be walking out of there looking like a masterpiece.\n\nCalled ahead on rainy Saturday & left with the best haircut I've had in years. Hip but not hipster, classic handsome good-looking cut. All done with minimal direction from me (take the sides & back in, comb the front forward & give it some height). I went home, inspected his work & it was flawless 360! Not one missed spot (usually, for me, behind the ears), & not one follicle left untended.\n\nIncredible attention to detail, very friendly intelligent funny guy (when he was done, he said, \""Well, I've done enough damage to you...What do you think?\""), good conversation & casual vibes, all for $14...\n\nJust. \nPerfect.\n\n#ItaliansDoItBetter\n\nI am King of All Bad Haircuts no more.\n\n#Freedom"
1,"The expression 'a diamond in the rough' was made to describe Nico's. At the outset, Nico's looks like a garage to fix cars in because of the large painted sign outside. However, inside there is a full bar with a restaurant and tables. The food is pretty good bar food and it's a karaoke hot-spot on Saturday nights. The karaoke crowd is pretty diverse and if you are really lucky you may catch Abba singing the Dawson's Creek theme song. Waitstaff is nice as well. 5 stars for the recovery room."
1,"This is a friendly, hipsters-and-yinzers-living-in-harmony kind of joint. Sports on the TVs, Yeungling on tap--quintessential Pittsburgh. The fried fish (with fries and coleslaw) is Lenten-Catholic quality. If I minded cigarette smoke, this place would be a four; but since I don't, perfect score. Like Scorpion once intoned...\""Get over here!\"""
1,"This place has everything!  And it's cheap!  They've got a nice cheese and meat counter, lots of imported Italian goods, and house-made treats, pasta, and other foods.\n\nHere's a tip: try their chocolate-covered almond biscotti.  Mmmmm."
1,"Jeannie is awesome! If you want a true Bloomfield Italian experience, this is the place.\n\nBreakfast is huge. If you can handle all that food for a cheap price, it's good for a hangover."
1,"I live right around the corner, so I've been here a couple times. The atmosphere is local, and the service is friendly and attentive. What wins this place 5*s  is the food - some of the best italian food I've ever had! Pasta, gnocci... even the salads have been delicious. The bar is beautiful as well. It looks very old but in a good way. I was so surprised by this place - it's one of those Bloomfield gems that I was very happy to discover."
1,"The tablecloths change every season, cow print, leaves, retro stripe and um, that other one. I'll be honest, Tram is crabby, but it's charming, somehow. He always frowns at me but smiles at my girlfriend. I just assume he's homophobic, but I only think this because he watches \""Fox News.\"" The tv is always on, but when you're seated, you can't really see it-- it's for Tram, situated just so he can watch it. The elementary school-style milk glasses are amazing and the perfect thing for the wine you should bring to eat with number 17, or the spicy peanut curry, or the saigon or sate soup.\nThe fresh rolls are amazing. This is the best Vietnamese food I have ever had, in any major American city."
1,"Ok, I have to give this place a 5, and no JUST because of the delicious food.  \n\nI'll preface my story with its probably the best Pho/vietnamese in Pittsburgh...yada yada...delicious...yada yada...cheap...yada yada...great pho\n\nBUT a lot of ppl have said its no-frills, angry servers who throw food at you.  And this has been the case a few times before my story tonight.  I've never minded.\n\nTONIGHT though...i went to get some take out pho on a snowy evening.  I had to wait for a few minutes...and the owner was nice enough to engage me in conversation while I waited.\n\nI get my Pho...paid..and I get in my car...and drove away...\n\nA block later, due to the snowy weather and my inability to slow brake...I squealed to a stop when some guy ran out into the street.  I did stop in time, spared his life...BUT MY PHO WAS EVERYWHERE!  Most of it was in the bag, but a good portion was on the floor...on the seat...MORE IMPORTANTLY, NOT IN MY BELLY.  So I drove into a parking lot...had to dispose of the mess...and cried.  \n\nNow not only did I NOT have pho...my car now smelled enticingly of beefy broth.  So in a moment of frenzy, I thought...What the heck...im only a block away, IM GETTING MY PHO.\n\nSo I went back...and got my pho!  AND...the guy didn't even charge me.  He was SO nice and he was like \""You said you dropped it, I believe you! here!\""\n\nomfg, I EFFING LOVE THIS PLACE."
1,"They have the best Pho (I get the vegetarian version), vegetarian spring rolls and tofu w lemongrass. Those are the only things I order there bc they are so delicious I can't bare to order anything else.  It's not the best atmosphere, but the food is delicious.. and that's what you go to a restaurant for!!"
1,love the pho and spring rolls !!! the best vietonamese restaurant !! i
1,"This is one of the best secrets of Pittsburgh. By far the best Pho in the area and over many places I have visited. If you want good service & environment, you'd better stop here. It's a hole in the wall by a seemingly angry asian (he's actually quite nice). Expect to wait on water or wait on refills. If you make your order too complicated, it'll probably get messed up.\n\nWith that, the Pho. It's amazing and I've had a lot of Pho. However, it has it hit and miss days too. The meatball is more tender and flavorful than the beef which can be dry or tough to some that haven't had Pho before. I wouldn't recommend any other versions. A small is available as most Americans I bring here are unable to finish a bowl.\n\nSpring rolls are great (cold/fresh) with a peanut dipping sauce. The egg rolls are just amazingly full of flavor (fried) with a fish style dipping sauce. Place is very inexpensive too. Oh, this place is BYOB in terms of alcohol. Forgot to mention it's cash only. There's an ATM at the entrance or any of the nearby gas stations."
1,The best Vietnamese I have tried in Pittsburgh. The Tufu lemon from the appetizers was just perfect. I found the place from Yelp.com and I would definitely recommend it! Very inexpensive too! I really like it!
1,"Just moved to the area and searched for a good place for pho. Stopped by and were pleasantly surprised.  The eggrolls hands down are the best we've ever had. Served them up with plenty of lettuce and herbs just the way we like it. The pho was good but nothing amazing. I had the curry chicken and was pleasantly surprised at how good the flavors were. Curry with just the perfect hint of sweet, so yummy! We will definitely be back! Don't judge a book by it's cover, this place is great!!!"
1,"I've gone to about five different Vietnamese restaurants in the Pittsburgh area, and Tram's kitchen tops them all. I am a vegetarian and love getting spring rolls and pho. I ordered both which were delicious, as well as coconut vermicelli noodles. The pho had just the right flavour with a generous helping of greens and tofu in the broth. The spring rolls were great, and I believe filled with tofu skin as well as greens and vermicelli noodles. You can also order the spring rolls individually ($1.95) which I think is a plus. The dipping sauce was great! We also had the vegetarian wontons as an appetizer. Everything was fresh and came out very quickly! The restaurant is cash only, but it's helpful that there is an ATM right inside their doors. I will definitely be going back!!!"
1,The spring rolls are out of this world. The pho is good. We went for lunch and had no problem getting a seat. Cheap and delicious.
1,"I had the fresh spring rolls and the pho, both are great.\n\nConsidering prices of all restaurants in Pitt, the prices here are very nice! For a large pho, it was $7-8. Spring rolls were $1.50 each.\n\nThings to note: cash only\n\nAlso, you can get the pho with beef, chicken, or meatballs. You get a nice portion, but the pho does not include tripe, tendon, flank, and other random meats you'd normally get with your pho elsewhere. \n\nBesides this, broth was excellent and portion/taste was great."
1,"Best Vietnamese in Pittsburgh. The quality of the food in amazing. The service is, as most places with delicious food, not incredible. I don't let that bother me, as the food is worth a drive. I love the chicken pho, and also the curry vermicelli. I enjoy a Vietnamese coffee on occasion, and have sampled most everything on the relatively small menu. Many plates of spring rolls and fresh rolls have passed through my lips, and as I type this I honestly don't know why I am not there right now. In fact, I tried to go there today, but unfortunately they're closed Mondays. Bring cash!"
1,"Breakfast, breakfast, breakfast!!!  I've been here many times over the years 90% of which I've ordered breakfast.  Diner breakfast easily excites me and this place hits the spot!!  Home fries over hash browns and if my bacon bends and not breaks, then you can get  from me!  I don't think I've ever had a bad experience here.  I love it here any time of day from early a.m. when the seniors are here to after hours when the drunks are here lol. Thanks for many delicious meals, Ritters, and hopefully more to come :)"
1,Best drugs in town!
1,"People who know me...know me as a food fanatic.  Tessaro's is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh, hands down.  It is not pricey.  It is not pretentious.  It is all-American and good food.\n\nEverything about it is so...customer-centric that recalls the essence of Pittsburgh.  The host (normally the owner - check out his fantastic Heinz bottle tie that he wears every Friday) takes the number in your party and actually remembers your face.\n\nPeople come here normally for the burgers.  The patty is incredibly juicy (they ground it in the restaurant, not delivered, very fresh and you can taste it).  The lettuce crisp.  Tomatoes no exception.  I can't comment on cheeseburgers since I don't like cheese in them.  I have been here for Thursday Ribs night and it's absolutely fantastic, particularly the chicken ribs.\n\nGets very crowded during the dinner rush hour so expect to wait between 6-8 pm."
1,"Best Burger In The Universe.\nI am a burger lover.  People ask me, \""Alli, where can I get the best burger in DC?\"" I tell them that they need to take 270 to Frederick, get on 70 west, get on the PA turnpike, and get off when they're near Pittsburgh.  Ask anyone how to get to Tessaro's - I'm sure they know.\n\nYour burger will be huge, dripping, and will be so juicy that the bottom bun will be a disgusting soggy sponge.  None of that will matter, because you will be in burger heaven, delighting in the freshly ground beef that makes Tessaro's what it is.\n\nThe restaurant itself is barely more than a bar, with mean waitresses and tiny, crammed tables.  No one would probably ever go there (besides the old, crotchety regulars) were it not for the world-famous burgers.  All testament to why you must go. Now."
1,"Everyone's commentrs about this unpretentious pub style restaurant are understated.  When you approach the corner location your iniotial reaction is that this must be the wrong address.  Keep the faith !!\nOnce inside the people are friendly, whth all sorts and ages of people.   The service is supurb and the food is incredible.  The hamburger is the best one I have had in my 50+  years of being a hamburger lover.  The dry blue cheese bacon burger has no peer.  The Chicken salad is the best my daughter has ever had.  The mushrooms in garlic butter are habit forming.\nWe cannot believe what a jewel this is and the pleasure you get eating their fine food !!!  You must not miss it !!"
1,"A great Pittsburgh Restaurant.  If you want to get a taste of some great local food here, this is one of those places. \n\nI would recommend that Fillet Mignon. I got a 16oz special cut medium rare.  One of the best Steak's I've had in a while. \n\nI've had the burgers here, and probably Pittsburgh's closest equivalent of RJ Grunts in terms of good burgers."
1,"Tessaro's has some of the finest burgers in the US.  A wonderful \""corner bar\"" kind of atmosphere makes it THE place to take people in from out of town.  Grilled meats and daily seafood specials (try the prawns) are available and also an excellent choice, but the burger is easily the main event.  \n\nThere are a few downsides, it's frequently packed on the weekends, seating can be cramped, and taking a party of more than 4 is damn near impossible.  But I'd still highly recommend it to anyone!"
1,"I went here after reading all the great reviews here on yelp. I was not disappointed and I don't believe my companion was either. It was a Friday night around 9 and the place was packed. We got right in and was seated in less than a minute.Our server came right to us for our drink order. We both ended up ordering burgers, I had the BBQ and it was bomb, delicious. O, and they came so fast, I mean  I was expecting a long wait considering I ordered mine Medium Well. Very good all around and the bill was round $40 for 2 burgers and 4 drinks."
1,"Tessaro's is definitely the best burger you'll find in Pittsburgh. Their sides are also delicious. If you have vegetarian friends that protest, they have vegetable kabobs that are actually really good as well. If you love burgers and you're in Pittsburgh, you'll have to try it out. If you've been but haven't gone back in a while, what are you waiting for?\n\nDuring peak meal hours, the wait can be about 15-30 minutes. The staff is friendly and helpful - they know that they serve a mean burger, and they are happy to be part of it all. \n\nOne warning, be prepared to be stuffed."
1,"Tessaros has a full menu, but if you go there you need, no you must order a burger.   They have the very best restaurant burgers I have ever eaten.   Not greasy, great taste, and they grill them right there in the bar.\n\nDon't miss out on the best burger of your life."
1,"Tessaro's was both a passing point and my final destination on my hamburger road trip across America.  I've had famous burgers such as the ones at Mr. Bartley's up in MA or the french bread burgers down at Rotier's in Nashville as well as regional burgers like the green chili cheeseburgers of the southwest.\n\nAfter it all, I still see Tessaro's as one of the best burgers I've had ever (my other top burger joints are scattered throughout the midwest where the beef is as fresh as fresh gets).  I started out with medium rare burgers when I first started going there, but eventually I toned down the knob to rare.  My cheese choice is always a slice of American.\n\nI typically like my burgers griddled with only burger bun and cheese, but since Tessaro's serves up \""Pub Burgers\"", I find it okay to eat with rabbit food (lettuce, tomato, onion).  Ketchup on a burger is blasphemy.  There is never a reason to add ketchup on a burger unless the burger is of poor quality.  Ketchup on a good burger is like heading to a prime steakhouse and asking for A1.  Save it for when you overcook your burgers at home or when you're at McDonald's.  Mustard is okay in reasonable quantities since its texture and taste complements the burger as opposed to covering it up.\n\nMy first thought was wow. These buns are huge. The top bun was awkwardly round and I had squish it a little to get a first bite that consisted of both burger and bun. It worked out in the end, as the buns were able to sop up all the excess beef juice without getting excessively soggy and difficult to hold. The patty itself was perfectly cooked. A full half pound of loosely packed coarse ground beef. I'm not sure what blend they use (definitely more than just chuck), but I want to guess around 75-80% lean, which is perfect in my book. The beef itself had an amazing texture and wasn't heavily seasoned. The beef itself tasted remarkably fresh and just the right amount of \""beefy\"". I usually order cheeseburgers over hamburgers as the slice of cheese makes the burger more forgiving to being overcooked and dry; however, at Tessaro's, this was not the case. The slice of American cheese was perfectly melted and added the textural difference between the soft buns, the crisp lettuce, and the beefy patty. The lettuce and onions added additional contrast with their crunchy attributes, and the acidity from the two tomato slices balanced out the cheese. The soggy pickles were overshadowed by the red onion slices which offered not only a crunch but also a spicy kick, and I did not notice them at all.\n\nMy side choice is always home fries.  They come slightly charred and taste of delicious butter.  I had half my portion \""naked\"" and paired the half with the traditional Heinz ketchup. Honestly they didn't need the extra boost of flavor from the ketchup as they were amazing beforehand already. With the addition of the Heinz, the subtle tones of the char and butter were covered up, which was a pity.\n\nWhen you go to a steakhouse you order a steak.  When you go to a coffeehouse you order a coffee.  When you go to Tessaro's you order a burger."
1,"Tessaro's grinds their burger beef fresh, so you can order yours rare and not worry too much about dying from e. coli (though I suppose the threat remains). I get my burger, rare, with caramelized onions and dijon mustard. It is euphoria-inducing. \n\nThis place is run by the most gracious and lovely women. I feel so at ease here, I wish I could move in. There is a sort of serene-yet-clubby atmosphere, like a men's cigar club that has been suffused throughout with a wizened womanly vibe. Whenever I come here I never want to leave.\n\nThe only downside is that if you go with your veggie friends, they won't have many options. So don't bring them."
1,"Usually when I think of a burger, I think of mediocre meat and lots of toppings to mask the crappy meat. Fits the craving sometimes, but just not a spectacular meal. \n\nTessaro's has defined for me a burger eating experience unlike any other. The meat they use here is awesome, both in texture and taste. I always order medium-rare.\n\nIf there's one place I'd take my out-of-town friends to eat, it would be here."
1,"Let me start out by saying, I share food when it's good but I DON'T share food when it's REAAAAAALY good! So I was there with a friend enjoying their fantastic potato salad and she had scarfed hers down in like 5 seconds and her fork was headed towards mine. I stabbed my fork in the same potato she had settled on and yelled NO! And just think, this is JUST the potato salad from here! \n\nThe burgers are the juiciest biggest most incredible burgers ever! I stick with the cheeseburger because I want to enjoy the burger without any fancy smancy stuff on it. I literally had the first bite of the burger and the juice squirted out the other side. Ok, I know that sounds dirty...but it was SO good!! I haven't strayed much from the burgers, but I did have the tuna melt once and it was good, but nothing compares to the burgers. I mean, that's what you go there for! Plus, my friend saw Russell Crowe there while he was filming a movie in the burgh, so you have to know it's good if his peeps recommended he go there!"
1,"No joke, best burger I've had this side of the Mississippi.\n\nThe background here was that this establishment used to be a deli and they retained their butcher. Knowing the meat as he did, the secrets of the best burgers were passed down to the most delicious recipes in the most competent hands.\n\nRegardless of whether this is true or not, they do know meat and they do serve up quality grade. Don't be afraid to order yours medium-rare or Pittsburgh rare."
1,"Being a native of Pittsburgh I havea always heard tales of the best burger in Pittsburgh. Most of those tales had Tessaro's as the destination in question. The first time and every subsequent time I have been there has held up to it's legend. Don't get me wrong, there may be better burgers in Pittsburgh, but I have yet to find them.\n\nTessaro's has not only great burgers but also other foods that are delicious. Their menu is similar to what you would find in a steak house. They serve a lot of fish and steak aside from their burgers. After eating several different meals at Tessaro's I can say with no doubt that my favorite thing there is the \""Bacon-Bleu\"" burger with crumbled blue cheese (rather than creamy because they give you the opion). The bacon is amazing, the blue cheese melts to the bun within a coulple of minutes and the burger mean is so fresh that you can distinctly taste its freshness.\n\nThe ambiance of the place is really nice too. It is an older place which has kept that old Bloomfield feel still to this day. Everyone is extremely nice there. The owner is usually there at the door to greet you and is always willing to have a nice conversation with you in the time when she is not flying around trying to get people in their seats. \n\nThe only downfall with Tessaro's and this is not their fault is that they are alway's almost too busy. Because this place way a neighborhood bar at one point it doesn't exactly have a lobby for you to wait in while you wait to be seated so that part of your dinner may be a bit uncofortable but all in all Tessaro's will be a great experience, espescially for those who are a fan of the old fashion hamburger and beer."
1,"I have eaten here before and I was very Impressed with the Gourmet Cheeseburger. \n\nThe Burgers here are \"" special \"" You have to try one to understand \""Special \"" ( that means GREAT for you bone heads out there )\n\nThis time I had the BEEF Ribs. They were cooked perfectly .The Flame from the wood fired ovens made these ribs so tender and delicious.....  The smell of the wood fire will make a vegetarian beg for a beef fix. The staff was very friendly and very accommodating.\n\n have  to give you guys a 5 star here !\n\n\n\nThis place will go back to being one of my favorite Pittsburgh treasures."
1,"Best burger anywhere.  A Pittsburgh landmark.  The best hostess -- charming, firendly, makes everyone feel at home and as if you are her only concern.  The burgers are the highest quality meat, cooked to perfection."
1,A classic! Perfect burger to compliment my visit to Pittsburgh. Can't wait to come back.
1,Start out by saying I worked there almost 20 years ago and the place and the employees are the same. In the restaurant business or any business constancy is key. The food is very good and the place is clean. It looks old because it is but that's part of fun. The family who owns it is a great family. If you go through Bloomfield stop in but make sure your hungry.
1,"Finally made it to Tessaro's with my husband and another couple.  It truly does have the best burgers ever!  We all got burgers;  2 cheeseburgers and 2 Kelly burgers.  Absolutely delicious!  The guys got chile as well and it was very good...rich and tomatoey and very well seasoned.  The burgers were cooked to order and were great.  Our waitress, Jessica, was very kind and helpful and was a great server!  We will definitely be going back!"
1,This place is worth checking out of you want a great burger!   It will make you want to come back!
1,"If you like cheap, divey bars you need to get yourself to Teabags.  One of the very few bars that I've been to in Pittsburgh with a legitimate mix of people from all walks of life.  The bartenders are almost always lovely (only had one wacky one so far) and the patrons are delightful.  There's a pool table that is usually open, though it's not the finest table in town it fits the vibe of the place.  The drinks are dirt cheap.  The beer is always cold and the mix drinks are strong.  This place is just really perfect in my opinion and I'm just sad I didn't discover it sooner."
1,"I lived next to Teabags for over a year before checking it out and I definitely regret waiting that long. \n\nIt is huge on the inside, tons of bar space and plenty of room to stand and play pool. Clean for a dive bat, private bathrooms downstairs. Excellent jukebox. \n\nStaff has always been a delight, have enjoyed watching hours of random nonsense on tv with them. Prices are dirt cheap. They have a house drink called like the deep blue or something that is jack, schnapps, and curacao, get that you will not regret it."
1,The beauty of living directly next to Twisters is that well I have an unlimited supply of frozen goodies right in my backyard literally.\n\nI only get the chocolate vanilla swirl for myself and a small scoop of sugar free vanilla ice cream for the puppy.\n\nThe ladies that work there during the summer are always super nice.\n\nNothing to ever complain about here.
1,"In general, I'm not into sports bars, however, Silky's at Liberty and Evaline has that genuine sports/Irish pub feel to it that's just right. Sitting at the bar is really nice, there are at least 5 TVs to watch your favorite sporting event on-- there is also a shuffle board table and I see groups meeting here for after-work drinks often.\n\nThe food is A+ bar food, I love the Reuben sandwich and every night they have some themed drink special night. I think Thursday night is ladies night and on Friday they have free wings from 5-7. The last time I went I watched the U.S. Open Women's Semi-finals and the wings did not disappoint!"
1,Awesome wings and they're 50 cents during all Pen's games
1,"This is one of the coolest laid back bars to go to. It draws a little bit of an older crowd, so the atmosphere is chill and fun and provides a really good time. I'm a huge fan of drinking beers with friends and throwing darts, and with a few dart boards and a shuffleboard to boot this place is perfect. I've had food here a couple of times as well, and for bar food it's actually quite good. The location is perfect for sitting out on the tables right on Liberty and chatting with buddies as the cars go by."
1,Excellent food! Excellent service! I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants a great meal with great service.
1,They are friendly professional reliable quick I think that's enough . I keep coming back to them because I trust them.
1,"I always enjoy my time at Lot 17. You can just hang out and grab a beer or enjoy some food in the back. The food is amazing. I especially enjoy the Mediterranean Seafood Salad. It is a MUST ORDER. The sweet potato fries are a great compliment to any of the burgers, wraps, or sandwiches. Go to Lot 17, you will not regret it."
1,Consistently great food at a fair price.  I suggest the French Dip - a new addition to the already great menu.
1,"Friendly, fast, the prices are fantastic. It's the definition of town diner. Can't wait to come back and try everything else. Also they have grits, that's all I needed to know."
1,If you are looking for a place that has high class  decor.... this place is definitely NOT for you at all.  If you want a REAL down to earth place without any fakeness... this is definitely the place for you.  This is a very tiny place that hold 18 people \ninside (plus two table on the outside)\n\nI love this place.   The food is great!!!!!\n\nThe food is to die for.  Mama R. will make anything you want even though it may not be on the  menu.  The portions are very generous.  The place is owned by two awesome people (Mike and Ros).  They are definitely from the 60s era.  \n\nDon't let the employees scare you away.  They are ALL super nice people.\nThey have body piercings and tatoos every where.  Immediately after walking\nin I felt so comfortable. \n\nThanks Ross for an awesome breakfast.\n\nPS.. This place only take cash.
1,"This has become another Bloomfield Institution.  It's a great place to get breakfast and they do serve lunch.  The hours are odd, so it's usually a breakfast or a late night weekend place.  The environment is very charming and warm.  It's a place you will run into your neighbors and other Bloomfielders and some interesting characters.  \n\nThe food is made with love and it shows.  The owners and staff are good people.  You can't go wrong.  The prices are very reasonable."
1,"Had veal romano, it was excellent, some of the best veal I have had in a restaurant in years.  The pasta was also very good, I chose the Gorgonzola sauce, also very good.   The waitress was very friendly and the cost was reasonable."
1,"Just went to Alexanders Italian Bistro , \nBoy What a Treat ! There should be another Star for this place. The Food was excellent , the wine was very good and the deserts were to die for. Ok maybe I might have had a little too much wine.,But I was very impressed. The staff was very attentive , The Italian bread was fresh and plentiful, And I had the Angel hair spaghetti with Hot peppers and hot sausage. My friends had  seafood  selections. Espresso for everyone after the Tiramisu Deserts ! YUMMMMM !\n\nI would Recommend Alexanders to anyone who enjoys fine Italian food. ( PS its not a chain restaurant )\nParking was plentiful too. I LOVE Mom& Pop places. Very clean & cozy.\nMore Wine Please ?"
1,"A friend took me here for the best gnocchi I have ever eaten. We both chose the gorgonzola basil sauce; I added sweet baby peas and she added broccoli. We ate and ate and took home enough for dinner - it reheats really well. Clearly, whoever made that gnocchi is not a novice! Wine was half price since it was a weeknight, and the house cabernet was delicious. Service was stellar and the atmosphere is fantastic. I'd go regularly if I lived in Pittsburgh."
1,"I always thought I hated Thai food, but it turns out I just hadn't tried good Thai food!  Thai Cuisine is easily my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh right now.  As others say, try the curries; they're absolutely delicious.  Their mock duck and \""veggie chicken ham\"" (it really does taste like chicken and ham simultaneously) are very tasty, and a welcome addition to the menu.  And speaking of the menu, Thai Cuisine offers an entire vegetarian menu!\n\nAlso, the service here is perfect.  Really.  The servers are incredible."
1,"I love Thai Cuisine!! It is probably my favorite place to eat. I usually get their pineapple curry and it is fabulous. The service is usually great and they are always quick to refill your water glass. It is not cheap, but it is worth every penny. I also love that it is BYOB. I would recommend that everyone go there!"
1,"I heart Thai Cuisine! Ryan B. and I always go there for our Thai fix! We ordered the Tom Yum shrimp soup, which was so flavorful and hearty, as well as the Won Ton soup, which was a million times more flavorful than what you'd find in the typical Chinese restaurant. \n\nOur entrees are typically Winter Curry, which Ryan B. LOVES, and Cashew Chicken, which is spicy and delicious. \n\n\nBe sure to BYOB, this place is a must!"
1,"Hands down a great thai restaurant.   I ordered the Tom Yum Veggie Soup because of all the yelper's great experience, however, I thought the soup had a bit too much lemon juice.  Aside from that, my husband and I enjoyed a great meal.  We ordered the Fresh Tofu Roll, Spicy Beef Basils and Chicken Pad Thai.  It seems that no one talks about this number system of how spicey they should make your food.  The waiter asks if how spicey it should be from 1 to 10 (being the hottest).  We picked a number 4 and the Spicy Beef Basils was still very spicy.  The Pad Thai was delicious and amazing.  All together our bill came out to be $32.  We will definitely go here again very soon!"
1,"(BYOB)\nWent here for Saturday lunch with my husband, and we had some GREAT Thai Food! Although they open at noon, we were there a few minutes early and they seated us.  I'm a vegetarian so I really loved the fact that they had a separate menu with only vegetarian options. Made it easier than scanning through the entire menu. Prices are good! We shared spring rolls, pad Thai, green curry with 2/green teas for $31.\nThe interior was okay. Not very fancy, but fine. We will definitely be going there! The portions are big too, so we had some food to take home, which is always nice!"
1,"Really enjoyed the food here!  I was contemplating whether to give it 4 stars but then I thought what could have been better and couldn't really think of anything.  The service was prompt and friendly - they were attentive without being annoying.  \n\nI got what I usually get at Thai places - Spicy Basil Noodles and they were probably the best I've had in Pittsburgh.  I got a level 8 spicy and most of the time at other Thai establishments I'm disappointed in the lack of spiciness even when I get a level 8, but I can honestly say it was satisfactory level 8 spice worthy - which I truly appreciated.  \n\nIt was jumping for dinner and it's BYOB so stop by the wine and spirits store beforehand!"
1,"Great Thai food - ambiance is great, good service, great food!"
1,Our favorite place in Pittsburgh for Thai food! Service is excellent!!! We're kind of regulars now and we always get lucky to be served by this white guy who is awesome and polite. Their food is a little expensive but its so good. Try their tum yum veggie soup!!!! My favorite!
1,"I didn't quite realize how much I love Thai Cuisine until they closed for a few months to remodel. Their absence was deeply felt. Now that they are back in action, the restaurant is better than ever! It is now fully handicapped accessible, with a bright clean new dining room and multiple bathroom stalls. I was worried that the prices may increase due to the remodel, but no, they are the same. The food, also same, if not improved. The Tom Kha soup is as awesome as can be and our entrees were perfectly delicious. They still feature a separate vegetarian menu to make ordering easy. Most anything on the vegetarian menu is or can be vegan (just ask about egg - veg items do not contain fish sauce or shrimp paste). And the service has always been excellent."
1,"One of my favorite Thai places in the city.\n\nThere isn't one complaint I have about this little place.  The hostess greeted us and gave us a choice of tables.  The waiter introduced himself and gave his recommendations on the menu.  We ordered an appetizer, meal, and dessert.  He did not rush our meal, which was fabulous.\n\nDessert....we had the mango with sticky rice...delicious.  This was a new item that I tried and I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nThere isn't much that will keep me away from this wonderful place."
1,"Awesome!  We ate here several times and everything was very good.  Good service, clean place, and the noodles..."
1,"very delicious and good service. byob, which is a dream. love this place."
1,"A haiku:\n\nYum Yum Yum Yum Yum\nGood Oh My God So Good Yes\nYum Yum Yum Yum Yum\n\nHere is a story about the time I had a MAJOR FAIL:\nI lived in Bloomfield just blocks from this place, and I never ate here.  The end.\n\nSeriously, what the hell is wrong with me that today was the first time I ate here?  Also,if you eat lunch here during your work day, you should know the rest of your day will feel like a giant let down.\n\nThis place looks like a dive from the outside.  Its actually pretty cute inside.  They are really affordable.  I had the Pineapply Curry with tofu, and my friend had the Eggplant something, I cna't remember, but he liked it.\n\nThe lemongrass soup is good and spicy and the cripy spring roll is delicious and small, so you're ready for your entree.  I loved mine.  I ate the whole thing and I dont even feel guilty.  \n\nThis place is delicious, and I will definetly be back!"
1,"Fiori's has the Best Pizza on Earth, hands down. I have been eating there since we moved to Brookline in the 70's. My god, this pizza is perfect, the sauce sweet, the pepperoni crispy, with a small pool of the, oh, so good grease. I always dip my crust in it , heh. They have some Shakies behind the counter if you ask. Expect to wait if you stop while bar hopping and actually even finding a parking spot, can be a task. Man, I can't wait to get back to Pittsburgh."
1,"I LOVE Fiori's. The thought of their slices makes me drool. I can't think of a more perfect pizza anywhere. The pizza sauce is so deliciously sweet, and the crust is the perfect ratio of crunchy to chewy."
1,"My stepfather-in-law gave me sage advice about finding good pizza. If you don't know the pizza in an area, look for the dirtiest, rundown place you can find, and you'll find the best pizza in town. The thinking behind that is, if the place looks that bad but is still in busines, then there is a reason they're still in business. And in my experiences, it's almost always true.\n\nFiori's is a dive (in a good way)- the inside looks like it was put together in the '70's, and the staff isn't always the friendliest. Forget about parking- there are three spots on the side of the building and perilious street parking on the hill. The later in the evening you go, the busier the dining room. My suggestion is don't eat here- you're only asking for drama.\n\nBut then you get home with that steaming pie, and all the parking nonsense, questionable customer service, and wait in line vanishes as you're enveloped in cheesey, meaty goodness. The pizzas are big, there are a ton of toppings, and the sauce is sweet in a good way. My suggestion is try their white pizza, which I think rivals the ones I've had in New York. I get mine with ricotta cheese, mushrooms, and meatballs- I'm drooling just thinking about it. I also suggest you try their italian hoagie- big, lots of meat, good dressing, and toasted in a crunchy way- my favorite in Pittsburgh."
1,"We stopped at Fiori's after a late night walking around the inclines in Pittsburgh--although it is no where near the inclines.  We decided to grab a large pizza to fix our hunger and were not disappointed.\n\nFiori's feels like a place out of a Ben Afflack movie--the neighborhood joint where everyone knows each other.  In our half an hour there, I must have seen 8 different chance occurrences between people in town.\n\nOnto the pizza!  We got a 16 inch pie for just over 12 dollars!  Thin crust that was crispy, not overly cheesy or saucy--although the sauce did have a distinct sweet flavor.  Baked to perfection--lightly golden brown.  Enjoyable flavor!  If you have been to Grimaldi's in Brooklyn, it's a similar style with a different taste.  \n\nOverall: the pizza is good, atmosphere is easy! Don't listen to the haters, although parking is a pain."
1,"Just the facts:\n\n1) Realize there is a difference between authentic Italian pizza which varies from region to region and American/Italian Pizza.\n\n2) Fiori's falls under the latter category.  This is not authnetic Italian pizza.  In my opinion, is the best American/ Italian pizza in the Burgh (because of its sweet sauce).  There Italian Hoagie is great as well.   Most people havent tried their pasta  which is remarkable good for a pizza joint.\n\n3) Have been eating here since I was 5 years old.  I craved this pizza when I was living in Ital\n\n4) Parking sucks.\n\n5) ATM inside cash only"
1,"Just tried this place for the first time the other day. Personally, I'd consider it one of the best pizza joints in the city. Extra cheesy! I'll definitely be back again. Parking  on the street is a bit tight, but its definitely worth it."
1,Maybe the best pizza in Pittsburgh. If you want to see how pizza is supposed to taste give them a try. If you live near them and you haven't tried their pizza you probable live under a rock and don't deserve this delicious pizza.
1,"This has got to be one of my favorite places for Pizza in all of Pittsburgh!  When a pizza place does not have to deliver or even have a convenient place to park to pick up your carry out order, but is still slammed day in and out, it tells you something!  Secrets in the sauce!"
1,"Excellent Pizza. We got the large with pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms. It was VERY busy on a Saturday night but we got our food in a reasonable time. I suggest ordering to go, seating can be limited. Will definitely come here again."
1,Purchased a '12 Prius. Have been in for 2 scheduled maintenance services and am very satisfied.
1,"Ahhhhh. I cut my teeth on the RW&B in the mid nineties and just revisited it for the first time since then!! I always looked for thrift stores like this in LA and SF but....hell no. \n\nWow, has she gotten a makeover: ATM in the corner, a bathroom for patrons (one that is actually somewhat clean!) and the absence of that old person-Ben-Gay smell. Prices have gone up slightly....but where else can you buy a brand new tennis racket, framed photo of Kermit the Frog (signed!) and an oversized pair of Joan Collins a la Dynasty sunglasses....true story! And knowing that half your cart is filled with items the have color tags that are HALF OFF THAT day without knowing until checkout provokes sheer joy. I was a giddy schoolgirl the whole way home.\n\nFYI- it is still cash only and the parking lot can get a little wild. Watch out for the potholes!"
1,"Mike, the owner/cook, is awesome and the food was delicious."
1,"It's not Greek to me, because this place makes perfect sense!\n\nThe people that own it are so sweet and make the best food.\n\nEvery time I go there, I stuff myself until I want to die. And then I spend several sleepless nights sweaty and anxious until I can eat their food again. I went from not liking humus to a humus-based diet after eating here. \n\nBut do not ask for their recipes! Trust me, they know their food is made with magic and they are not sharing -- a bottle of wine and I tried to get it out of them once unsuccessfully."
1,"We live down the street and have been meaning to come here... Now that we have, we will be here ALL THE TIME! I hate croutons, I pick them off, but their home made croutons on the house salad were amazing! The hot garlic parm wings had me licking my fingers, the stuffed peppers had the best sausage in them, and the waitress was so sweet and accomodating... I couldn't be happier! The place isn't well advertised, so I feel it's necessary to say... Please come here, for your sake and to ensure this place stays open for the rest of my life. Thank you."
1,"This is my first visit here I was not extremely impressed when I first walked through the door.  We went to the back by the pool tables and wow it opens up nicely.  Our server was nice and prompt I asked her about a menu item and she said she didn't know but wait and I'll ask... Love that... we could hear the chef yelling the answer she came out and told us even though we had already heard the answer.  I ordered the Reuben my wife ordered the beacon cheese burger. The bread was light and perfectly tested.  the sourcrout was very nice and I suspect actual Russian dressing,  the corned beef was hot flavorful and moist it was delicious. Best I have had outside of NY.  So... nice decor good drinks and excellent food.  Chef even came out to chat(slower night) the fire fighters come here so you know it's good.  if you have a chance to stop by do it. You won't be disappointed"
1,"Pita Land has the best pitas in the city, hands down.\n\nThey also have amazing spinach pies and pepperoni rolls - well, technically, they are not pepperoni rolls, but pita pepperoni rolls. Which is even better. \n\nI brought a $8 jar of tahini from Giant Eagle and came in here two days later and saw I could have brought twice as much from here for the same price. Once I finish that jar, I am coming here to buy my tahini.\n\nThey also sell gyro sandwiches for $5 on Saturdays. I haven't brought one, but I sampled one and it tasted good."
1,Score ethnic food! I will say that I love their hummus. It's very tasty as well as their pitas (which appear to be sold all over the city). The staff is friendly and helpful and they have many things that you can't find anywhere else.
1,"Pitaland is the best run business in Brookline (with las palmas a close second).  The caf\u00e9 is well staffed and the food is delicious.  I love the breakfast flatbreads and falafel for lunch.  In a slew of mismanaged bars with little to no fresh food offerings on the Boulevard, Pitaland is a savior for us locals.  Support them with your business!"
1,"Pita Land, olive you.\n\nI don't know why I don't come here everyday.\n\nIt's a great little market, where you can get delicious Mediterranean/Lebanese/Middle Eastern groceries. They have fresh made hummus, dips, pita bread,  you name it! And everything's reasonably priced (don't have to shell out too many leaves for my grape leaves ...) \n\nBest of all, in the last year they opened a cafe inside. It's damn delicious and cheap to boot! The gyro, lamb burger, french fries with rosemary dip, flat breads are all excellent and won't disappoint!"
1,"This place is amazing and anyone who isn't giving it 5 stars is crazy. My husband and I just moved to Brookline from NYC and when we discovered this place I felt like I struck gold. The pita is incredible...like the freshest most delicious pita I have ever had. The baba ghanoush is fantastic and smokey...omg. I could eat that every day. I had the spinach pie with feta cheese and it was yummy. My husband liked his gyro, but next time will ask for a little more sauce. Pitaland is super clean, the employees are friendly and the food is the real deal. I plan on making it one of my regular stops."
1,"I was looking in Pittsburgh for a cuban rum cake... so after looking in different bakeries... I called the party cake shop and they have an italian rum cake... so I asked them that if they could make some changes, and they did.. the cake was delicious vanilla rum cake and white buttercream, pretty close to the cake that we love from Coral Gables Florida :) and the ladies very sweet they helped me to take the cake to the car because I had to babies with me... thank you so much."
1,"Our fav pizza spot in Pittsburgh! 1/2 butcher block & 1/2 veggie lovers is Awesome!\n\nYou get what you expect- Delicious PIZZA!  Toss salad is good with the pizza and the Calzones are great too!! MMMMM I'm getting hungry remembering it.   Look at the specialty pizzas on the back of the menu cause that's where it's at!!! \n\nHonestly, this place is mostly deliver and take out orders, the restaurant is not impressive and leaves much to be desired for ambiance.  10 old booths and lots of old sports memorabilia.  It seriously hasn't been updated since the first time I've been here, 18 years ago.  Don't expect an immaculately impressive bathroom, but you can find the only cloth roller towel I've EVER seen, straight from 1949.  \n\nIt's BYOB so bring some B or buy some from the store next door. \n\n (I don't really understand the previous reviewer's complaint about greasiness, I've never had this issue.  But I probably would not buy a piece of cheesecake from here cause come on, it probably wasn't make fresh here and it it wasn't then what's the point of getting it??)\n\nThis is always a good choice for pizza!!"
1,"I don't even know what to say other than, I love Carhops. I've been eating there for years and I've never been disappointed. Good food good service, family run. The theme inside the sub shop is all about cars and there's a bar in back. \n\nI have an unhealthy obsession with one of their sandwiches called the z-28. ( see picture) Its a fabulous cheese steak sub and it comes with all the things that dreams are made of,  including marinated steak, sauteed onions, white American cheese and the more minced garlic than you can imagine. The bread is baked fresh daily from a local bakery and is to die for. Some times I get peppers and mushrooms too. \n\nI love this sandwich so much that last labor day i had my boyfriend pick up a sedan (2 ft) z-28 sub and bring it with him from Pittsburgh to Detroit. so we could enjoy it together on our picnic. Sick right? Well I'll have you know that I have seriously considered giving them a call and seeing if they would be willing to ship one to me in LA. No matter the cost. \nI've tried a few other things there too. I think it was the fire bird. Which ever one had chicken and marinara. That was decent. Their loaded cheese fries are awesome. Lots of bacon bits. They call them something else though. Something car related. \nMy boyfriends favorite sub was the carhops special (hot) which is a favorite of many. I didn't really stray to much from my usual sandwich but they have lots of other subs and pizza too. \n\nNow let me just say that in the past five years I have tried to find a decent cheese steak sub that is at least comparable to the z-28 but its just no use. That sandwich is unique to carhops and always will be. The only place that has even come close is Jersey Mikes sub shop in Burbank. (which I'll be reviewing later) Its pretty good but I have nearly unreachable expectations for what I think a cheese steak sub should be so, I will continue to carry a torch for Carhops subs for as long as I have to. \nI love you carhops, I'd marry you if it were legal and sane to do so. \n- Love Laura"
1,"Seeing the signs for quite some time, we were glad to learn that Carhops is now open in their new Strip District location!  1806 Smallman St, in what used to be \""Bill's Produce\"".  Same great menu, same great taste!"
1,"Il Pizzaiolo serves authentic and delicious pizza and pasta.  I highly, highly recommend eating in the \""wine bar\"" out back - where the main restaurant is loud, bright, and crowded, the wine room is darker, more romantic, and closer to the bar."
1,Probably one of the best places to eat pasta or wood-fired pizza...
1,"Full review with pictures in blog: \n\nGreeted by our server, a friendly college age girl with an ever-present smile, our waters were filled and menus presented while we were left time to decide - time that would be welcome given the large size of the menu and the fact that I would have liked to try at least thirty items.  Discussing amongst ourselves while scouring other tables for evidence of portion size we eventually settled on one appetizer, two pastas, and a pizza...we then began the agonizing process of deciding which option sounded best.  \n\nBaked in house the first basket was had only three options while the second arrived with a fourth.  With each bread a great example of its particular type the baskets featured a smoky Rustic Italian, buttery Semolina Vienna, amply sour sesame seed crusted Sourdough, and a buttery moist Foccacia.  While I rather wish the pairing would have been a nice olive oil as opposed to butter neither were really necessary with all the sauce that required mopping up.\n\nBeginning the meal as the sounds of eager diners bounced around the wonderfully decorated brick and tile interior was a delightful Arancini with creamy arborio rice providing a slightly toothsome contrast to velvety fried Mozzarella.   An ample portion for a mere $6 the dish was only enhanced by resting the crispy balls of cheese in a pool of house-made marinara.  Remember the comment about the bread - a whole basket was used to dredge the plate clean of the aromatic and slightly acidic sauce.\n\nSelecting two of the eighteen pastas the pair was delivered simultaneously and looking back I still cannot decide which was better.  Beginning first with the Paglia E Fieno, a spinach and egg tagliatelle with peas, prosciutto di parma, parmigiano-reggiano, and cream I was stunned by the bouncy texture of the pasta to tooth yet its undeniable melt-in-the-mouth texture upon mastication...al dente done just right.  Complimenting the pasta were sweet and snappy peas, a smooth and salty prosciutto, and a pungent parmigiano-reggiano that added texture and pungency.  All balanced by a somewhat sweet cream sauce the entire dish was well thought out, well balanced, and divine.\n\nNot to be outdone, Gnocchi Di Ricotta featuring Ricotta Gnocchi, Butter, Sage, and Parmigiana-Reggiano was a dish that would have the three of us fighting for the last dumpling.  Simply prepared, as one expects from a rustic dish like gnocchi, the dumplings were undoubtedly the star of the dish-literally melting puddles of potato and ricotta cheese that provided little resistance to tooth, yet enough body to support and absorb the subtly sweet and aromatic sauce.  Topped with a quick grating of cheese and cracked black pepper the gnocchi was one of the best I've ever tasted-a skilled hand, perfect cooking conditions, and largely un-fussed-with.\n\nEnjoying all the previous efforts so much the \""star\"" of the afternoon was nearly an afterthought-and one heck of an afterthought given that it is where the restaurant made its name.  Opting for the Provola with Smoked Mozzarella di bufala, Cherry Tomatoes, Fresh Basil, Parmigiano-Reggiano, Baby Arugula, and Extra Virgin Olive Oil we watched as the dough emerged from the temperature controlled room, was rolled by hand, topped and was placed inside the stone oven for a mere 90 seconds.  Emerging bubbly and charred the pizza was topped with a heap of fresh arugala, drizzled with olive oil and a quick shredding of Parmigiano-Reggiano before being plated and brought to the table.  Squeaky and smoky the cheese was a perfect foil for the cornmeal accented and yeasty dough.  Crisp and toasted around the circumference of the 13 inche pie and sopping wet at the center each ingredient was pronounced in flavor with the super sweet tomatoes and basil forming the foundation and the bite of the parmigiano and bitterness of the Arugula providing a nice compliment of flavor.\n\nArriving quickly and in ample portion the house made desserts were both presented simply and unadorned.  Beginning first with the Tiramisu-a rather standard example with buttery lady fingers, smooth mascarpone, high quality cocoa, ribbons of chocolate, and a hefty shot of rum-it was good, but like many pre-prepared versions it was largely unbalanced with the rum soaking the bottom layer and cream dominating the top.  Significantly more impressive was the Cannoli, a crisp and slightly cinnamon accented shell housing a lightly lemon tinged ricotta cream.  One end dipped in crushed pistachio, the other in chocolate chips, and sitting atop a bed of hand whipped cream-light, refreshing, and authentic.\n\nGreat service, everything expertly prepared, and prices that fit the quality of the ingredients I was very happy with every aspect of our meal.  Honestly, when the pizza, one of the best I've ever had was the \""worst\"" savory...that is saying something.  Clearly I need to start paying attention to that Verace Pizza Napoletana Association list when I travel."
1,"Pasta is my second language. Eating pasta is my sport! \n\nWith that said, I'm always hesitant to get gnocchi because it never seems to be cooked right. It's always gummy and gross. But the waitress assured me the gnocchi here was homemade and very delicious. I took her advice and was served an incredible plate of melt in your mouth light and puffy clouds of Italian magic! Need I say more? Ok I will.... \n\nThe sauce also tasted delicious and definitely homemade. I was torn between getting the gnocchi or pasta vodka. I would have been totally satisfied with that choice as well. Thankfully, my friend ordered the pasta vodka and I ws able to steal away a couple bites of it. The sauce was fantastic! It was so creamy and had a hint of Parmesan cheese flavor. Cheese makes EVERYTHING better in my eyes (and mouth)! \n\nOur server was really fantastic and did a great job with input on our meals and also filling us in on some upcoming events. They're having cooking classes and wine pairing nights, which I'm totally into! Such a great way to get people in the door and eating, plus drinking! \n\nVery quaint and cute inside. I went there Thursday and had to hold myself back from not going there again on Saturday.  My pasta loving self will sure to be back soon though!"
1,Still one of my all time favorite places to eat!!! I now live in New York City and haven't found anything like Pizzaiolo. This place is a real treasure!
1,"Have I found my new favorite date spot? My fianc\u00e9e and I just enjoyed dinner here last night and we were thrilled with every part of our experience at Il Pizzaiolo. We showed up pretty late, around 9:20pm and were provided with quick service from a friendly server. \n\nI was pleased with their wine list- lots of great Italian reds. The Barbera d' Asti they have by the glass is excellent! We ordered the Carcuccieri pizza (or had a similar name- the one with artichokes and prosciutto) and loved every bite. Real wood-oven cooked thin crust pizza, with good quality toppings and San Marzano tomato sauce. Molto bene!\n\nWe parked on the street and were able to find a spot easily. Seemed like a pretty and safe neighborhood. When the weather is decent, dine outside on their back patio. It's gorgeous and romantic!"
1,This place has the best pizza I've ever had besides Keste and Paulie Gs in NYC.  Wood fired greatness.  Expect to wait on weekends in a crowded wine bar.  FANTASTIC red sauce and olive oil.  Not extensive on the wine list but good by the glass selection. A gem in Pittsburgh.
1,"Now, this isn't the best pizza I have ever had, but it is the most authentic and that is why it is getting 5-stars.  I was craving and in search of a place where I could get the most authentic DOC style Italian pizza, and I honestly think that this place is the best I have ever had at making a certified Margarita pizza.  I cannot wait to go back: luckily, my grandma lives across the street!!"
1,The most delicious pizza and the best cocktails in the area!! Such friendly staff!! I've always had an amazing experience!!
1,"On my second adventure to this wonderful restaurant, my expectations were met yet again.  It was a busy Friday night, but we just headed up to the wine bar to enjoy cocktails until our table was ready. I had a yummy wine, and my BF had an amazing margarita.\nWhen we were seated our server was friendly and let us know about the days specials. Throughout the meal, while he was quite busy, we were not neglected and I always had a full glass of wine. :)\nI decided on gnocchi and my bf went with a pizza....both we so delicious.\nTheir food is just amazing, I could not rave about it enough. \nI've seen people complain that sometimes they have to wait to be seated, but don't let this deter you from trying this amazing restaurant!"
1,"Excellent Italian restaurant. We ate in the wine bar behind the actual restaurant which was very nice and cozy. We shared the sea bass and eggplant parmesan. Portions were generous and the food was excellent. The eggplant parmesean was the best I have had and rather than the frequently found thin slices of breaded eggplant, this dish had nice thick slices with fresh mozzarella and basil. In addition to a great wine list they also had some unique beer selections. Although we did not try them, the brick oven pizzas also looked worth trying. Service was very attentive. We would return in a heartbeat."
1,"First of all, Sarah was the most awesome waitress!!! Loved her wine selection suggestions, as well as dinner entree recommendations!\nThe Paccheri Alla Siciliana was a wonderful marinara sauce tossed with eggplant Fresh Bufula Mozzarella balls and was delicious! \nThe pappardelle al funghi, a delicious while wine and olive oil sauce, was tossed with pasta and shiitake mushrooms! \nBoth dishes were delicious and the amazing pure ricotta cannoli for dessert, excellent!!! \nHighly recommend this restaurant. We ate in the upstairs wine bar. But will definitely come back to sit in the beautiful courtyard garden!"
1,"Extremely pleased! Loved the bread at the table, wedding soup was amazing, the pizza I chose for dinner was very unique - fried the finished in the fire oven. It was excellent. Loved the Italian craft beer as well! Will be back!"
1,Great sushi bar. The staff and owner are extremely attentive. Great presentation. Decent price too. And I got to sit next to Mario Lemeuix at lunch a couple weeks ago!
1,Awesome sushi. Nigiri sushi here is a must-try.
1,"Love Little Tokyo. Dedicated customers keep the place full all week long and on the weekends. If cleanliness is important to you, this is the restaurant you want. You could safely eat off the floors. Staff is friendly but unobtrusive. A definite favorite."
1,Best fresh sushi in town. Their prices are great and the service is good. They also own the Little Tokyo in South Side and both places are awesome.
1,"I love this place!! I'm not a sushi fan, so I have 2 words for the non-sushi eater: Hibachi chicken! Dip it in that yummy shrimp sauce!"
1,"Hands down, best sushi in the city.  I think this is both if you are a roll person or if you are a sashimi person - which is not the case everywhere.  Some places make awesome rolls, but that seems to be to hide the not-freshness of the fish.  Others have great fresh fish, but can't make a roll to save their lives.\n\nThis place does it all.  J and I went here on a Friday night around 6 and were sat immediately - no wait, but the place was pretty packed.  I started with some hot sake and a green salad.  Their ginger dressing is delish!  I was practically licking the bowl.  I considered asking for more lettuce to soak up the rest of the dressing when our shrimp shumai came.  J and I try to get shrimp shumai everywhere we go as a barometer and this was by far the best.  The wrappings were complete and held in all the very fresh shrimp goodness.  Then came the sushi.  We ordered the First Date roll, the David, the black marlin, the spicy tuna and the spicy scallop.  What can I say, we like sushi.  The black marlin is amazing - mild, fresh, not chewy.  The spicy scallop is not something you see everywhere and definitely a plus here.  However, where they really shine is the spicy tuna.  Everyone does a spicy tuna.  At most places, you can barely taste the tuna in the mayo-based spicy sauce that is slathered all around.  Here the tuna is front and center with spices mixed into the pureed tuna.  No mayo needed to hold it together and all the better for it.  The David and First Date were a bit pricier and also awesome.  One was tempura shrimp with spicy tuna on the outside and the other was more like a rainbow roll.  Both excellent.  \n\nWhile I do also love me some Katana in Dormont, this place has the best sushi in the city and in a charming location in downtown Mt Lebanon."
1,Chopsticks down the best sushi in the burgh.  Consistently good.
1,"Love their sushi here. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. There is on street parking, and also a parking garage across the street."
1,"This is amazing sushi.  I have not tried the hibachi but it is nice that they have it for dining with a mixed sushi/non sushi eating crowd.  \n\nThe sushi is spectacular and there is high attention to detail.  The miso soup is made completely from scratch, no cans.  The grated radish and other garnishes are made fresh daily.  There is no hint of staleness in anything.  The bartender is also generous in his pours.  We are never in a hurry when we go for sushi so I haven't paid too much attention to the time it takes but they always bring out the next item as we are finishing the previous.  We have frequented here for a little over a year and always leave very pleased.  \n\nFor the food quality and attention to detail the prices are also extremely reasonable."
1,"Best sushi ever, can't wait to try it once again. Deserves every penny, in the end you get what you pay for. If you're sushi fan, then you must try this place. By far the best ever sushi in Pittsburgh . The waitresses are so friendly . The environment so elegant, lavish, and classy . I highly recommend this restaurant ."
1,"Best pizza in the 'Burg! They definitely don't skimp on the cheese and the sauce is awesome....it has a fresh tomato taste to it that goes well with the crisp, nutty crust."
1,"This pizza is a classic!  If you visit Pittsburgh, you have to try it.  The shop is not big on \""ambiance.\""  It is a casual little pizza shop with a few tables, very small, very VERY informal.  But, man is that pizza great.  I love the sauce!"
1,"Great pizza, our new go to pizza place. Always satisfies our craving."
1,Got an amazing facial here. I have been there for a pedicure and massage in the past. It's great.
1,"I have been going here for hair cuts and color for years! Wonderful stylists - very professional and well trained. They also have other services...full spa, nails, pedicure. Would HIGHLY recommend this salon!!!"
1,I had my first bridal gown experience at Anne Gregory. The entire staff there made me feel beautiful and comfortable throughout my entire appointment. They were able to pick dresses that matched my style and personality and every dress was stunning! I found my gown in a matter of 45 minutes and didn't want to take it off! It is a beautiful Monique Lhuillier! I highly recommend going to Anne Gregory for your bridal experience- it was a stress free and exciting day!
1,"I ended up at Anne Gregory because they were the only place in Pittsburgh having a trunk show with a dress I saw online and really wanted to try on.  My maid of honor maid the appointment and a couple of my bridesmaids, my mom, and grandma came with me to try the dress on.  The experience was lovely and I ended up buying the dress.  A lady was originally helping me then the owner came out a little later on.  Let me tell you....this guy knows his stuff.  He made me feel totally at ease about the purchase.  It was like being a nice restaurant and the chef coming out to check on how your meal was.  I really appreciated him being there.  I wasn't buying the most expensive dress in the place but he certainly made me feel like I was.  It was really great.  I went to a few other places and this one is definitely the best."
1,Really good burgers!
1,"This is the sports bar I have been looking for since I moved to Pittsburgh! I only wish it was closer!\n\nWe checked this place out on Saturday. We were dressed up because we were attending a reception for a wedding later on and we were just trying to kill time. There weren't too many people in there and majority of the TVs were focused on the Pitt game with a few other games sprinkled throughout. \n\nFirst win: PUMKING! I am seriously in love with that stuff. The bartender was incredibly nice and funny and social, which is how I like my bartenders. I mean, shouldn't they all be like that? Customer service is pretty much your job, but I digress ...\n\nWe didn't eat anything, as I said, we were heading to a reception afterwards, but we got to enjoy some beers and watch a bit of the Penn State and FSU games, my two favorite teams, so that was nice. The TV setup was in such a way that no matter where you were sitting you could see the game, a feature most sports bars in this town seem to be lacking. Prices and selection seemed on point and the bartender hooked it up! :) All in all I was super satisfied."
1,"Have a home project or problem...ask the experts at Rolliers.  They can help you fix it or they repair many things like screens and lamps.\n\nNeed seasonal lights and decorations.  Rolliers has it.  Check out the Xmas display of Studio 56 stuff!  The kids love it!  Big kids Too!\n\nGreat place to pick up items and get assistance.  Need some work cloths, Rolliers has it.  Need paint, window blinds, household items, electrical items, Rolliers has it.\n\nThe staff just assisted teaching me in how to repair a few items and help save me a ton of $'s!  \n\nPrice wise most items are competitive with other hardware places.  Sometimes a little more but the experts are worth it."
1,"Imagine those hardware stores you see on tv / movies where the you can go and know that you will get reliable help, well Rolliers is that place. The concept of customer service and expertise is not something of a past era. I have been here more than a dozen times for reasons and I have never left disappointed. \n\nI walked in with door knob pieces for a 100 year old door - not only did they know exactly what I was looking for, they had dozens to choose from to make sure that I had the exact ones I needed. \n\nI could only imagine the look of bewilderment that I would get if I walked into that big orange or blue \""home centers\"" with the same questions. \n\nI have gone back since and will continue to go back over and over again because I trust what I am told when I ask questions - something that is hard to find these days. Yeah, some of the items might be a little more costly (not much from my experience) but that extra pays for customer service that you don't get from someplace that is concerned with shareholder profits. I would rather pay a little more and know that I am getting what I need for the job the first time rather than wasting my time over and over again."
1,"The Korner Pub is a delightful little dive with the perfect mix of classic Pittsburgh dive and craft brew haven. \n\nI grew up near this bar, and remembered the murky smoke-filled spot as somewhere I'd never venture. Since the Korner Pub has come under new ownership and cleared up the smoke, it's been recommended to me by countless South Hills dwellers. \n\nIf you're looking for a laid-back spot to grab a beer, watch the game, or play some pool, this is the place. The draft list is fantastic, with a wide range of crafts brews both local and national. I bugged out when I saw the prices. $13 growler fills? This is officially my new growler filling station. The prices are affordable, and the pub also offers cans and 6 packs to go. The menu also offers pitchers of all the drafts--a welcome choice when you bring a group or plan to stay for awhile. \n\nIf you're not a brew fan, I might not recommend this to you. The spot only offers beer, and there is no food sold here. I'm told you can bring in a meal--which is easy enough with several pizza joints nearby. \n\nThe space is really simple, with a main bar, a dart room, and the pool table in the back. I played a quick game of pool while polishing off a Nitro Mojo IPA. I'm sorry I couldn't stay longer, and made a promise to be back very soon."
1,Been there twice so far and have to say Maggie is so sweet and very knowledgeable. She listens to your concerns and gives you advice outside of acupuncture to help with your problem. The office is very clean and easily accessible to anyone who lives in the south hills.
1,"It's hard to argue with the delicious, fresh coffee and the never-ending parade of fresh baked treats coming from the modest little coffeehouse at the edge of the Lebo shopping district. I can happily while away a half-workday, sipping mug after tall mug of their house roasts while utilizing the wi-fi that has become as much a part of coffeehouse decor as the vintage seating.\n\nI like to set up shop towards the back, away from the cold outdoors but more importantly right by the kitchen where the bakers are outdoing themselves several times an hour. Biscotti, banana bread and pumpkin bread, coffee cake with huge nut pieces, and about 439 kinds of cookie emerge and never disappoint."
1,"The best little coffee shop in Pittsburgh!\n\nThe atmosphere is great!  The baristas are super friendly (the one woman is the most cheerful, happy person I've ever met) and helpful.  I commonly ask about the flavor of the day, and they give me their honest feedback and opinion.  I particularly enjoy the hazelnut and caramel nut ones; they seem to be more nutty and less sweet than most places.  I've had more than my share of espresso drinks as well, and they are also great.\n\nYes, there are occasionally 10+ middle or high school kids there, but in my experience, they're respectful and well behaved.  \n\nIf that's not enough to take Uptown to the next level, the desserts are out of this world.  Muffins, apple coffee cake, cookies, lemon squares, banana bread, omg I could go on and on and on.  All of it outstanding.  Also, they serve Betsy's Ice Cream!!!!!  \n\nI've never had a problem with the temperature (if you're cold, move toward the back, if you're hot, move toward the front).  But the wifi will occasionally need to be reset.  The baristas are always happy to help."
1,"I am writing an update to Magee Women's Hospital.  My attitude towards them has not changed.  This is still the best place for a woman to get healthcare, especially ob-gyn services.  But it will soon be the tenth anniversary of my second of three surgeries I had to have done.  In looking back, I don't know how I could have had them done anywhere else.\n\nThe second surgery was bad enough, the third was even more serious because it involved a life-changing decision.  Instead of being very cold about it, I was given my options and told calmly and with empathy, \""Susan, this has to be done\"".  And I'm telling you that despite the difficult choice I had to make, they guided me through the entire process."
1,"The vanilla lattes are a little sweet, but delicious. This place is perfect when the weather is nice and they can open the garage door. It's definitely a must-visit coffee shop on Walnut."
1,"What can I say about a laundromat? It's clean and well staffed, no creepy dark corners, the machines are maintained and cleaned, and there's free parking with a little japanese grocer next door.  It's a little more expensive than a regular laundromat, but worth it."
1,"Came to this location based on other popular Yelp reviews and was very satisfied. The location is very clean and reasonably priced. The staff seemed very friendly although I did not have to personally interact with them. One issue might be availability of machines during peak times. My visit was around 3:00pm on a Saturday and I had no issues. There is free WIFI too! Overall, very pleased and I will definitely visit again."
1,Clean very clean present people $2.10 for shirts and I hate doing launder at a mat but if I have to then I will do it hear.  It's worth the extra buck to do it some where thats clean has WiFi a tv for the game and is right next to a bottle shop and a bar. Ok everything is stainless.
1,"Oh, laundromats. How you take me back to my days in college and grad school. Though I've been fortunate to have in-home laundry capabilities everywhere I've lived over the last several years, recently I found myself in need of professional (laundry) help when my dog puked all over our comforter and mattress pad (thanks again for that, little buddy). Our washer was too small to do the job, so off I went to the Laundry Factory.\n\nLike I said, it's been awhile since I've been to a laundromat, so I don't know what other laundromats are like these days, but wow, this one was wayyyy nicer than the ones I used to go to back in the day! It was modern, clean, bright, and had tons of well-kept machines. No dank corners where sketchy people loitered, no broken machines, no weird funky old sneaker smells. \n\nThey had several sizes of machines to choose from, ranging from average (a regular household laundry machine) to mega-capacity. I chose the \""large load\"" machine, which fit our comforter and mattress pad just fine. A load in the large capacity machine cost $6.00, which seemed a little steep, but not too bad. Other machines ranged in price from $2.75 to $10.00 (super mega capacity machine). They also have super capacity (50 lb.) dryers, which was very handy. It was $.50 for the first 5 minutes of drying time, and then $.25 for every 4 minutes after that. Again, seemed a little steep, but the dryers were very efficient -- I think it took only about 15 minutes (on low heat, no less) to dry my bulky items.\n\nThey had well-stocked change machines and a nice little lounge to wait in. I didn't see any bathrooms, so good thing I refrained from going to the beer store next door to have a cold one while I waited.\n\nThey do have a parking lot, but it's really small and packed, so you'll probably only get a spot if you're lucky. So plan to either park on the street or behind the building (I found plenty of space behind the building and wasn't ticketed or towed).\n\nAnyhow, next time I need to use a large capacity washing machine (which I hope is NEVER -- hint hint, my little doggie friend), I will not hesitate to come back here."
1,"Sometimes I come all the way to Pittsburgh from Akron JUST to visit Eons.  The employees are friendly & knowledgeable.  The clothing is very well organized, separated by era and then by size.  This is one of the only vintage clothing stores I've been to in the country that has a large selection of deadstock items, complete with their original tags.  The dresses I have purchased here are absolutely amazing, many of them never worn.  I will continue to visit on my quarterly P-burgh visits!"
1,"I lovvvvve this place. It's really well organized, employees are friendly, and I never leave without buying something. Last time I was here I got two necklaces (the jewelry is great), a quilted jacket, and a blazer with polka dot lining.\n\nI always make a stop here when I'm back in Pittsburgh."
1,Meticulously organized and a great selection. Definitely worth a stop.
1,"You simply have to visit this shop, they have the best quality vintage clothing and really excellent customer service.  The store feels cramped, but then again it is packed with a great selection of vintage clothes.  Everything is laid out very logically, and the prices are quite reasonable, especially given the quality.  \n\nIn particular, you will find a great selection of men's bow ties, and I have looked unsuccessfully for these at other stores.\n\nOne more thing, the owner supports the local community, he is continually helping out non-profits by donating or loaning merchandise and by publicizing their events."
1,"THE place that I went for a nice conversation + cocktail combo in the 'burgh. Great atmosphere, great drinks, great food. Ahh, Soba. If only all Pittsburgh restaurants could be like you, the world would be a better place."
1,"Good beer specials when I've had their beer specials for the night.  Appetizers & entrees are usually perfectly sized, if not a little large.  The one exception is the fried calamari - the plate was probably about twice the size it needed to be!\n\nThe complementary small-portioned appetizer (I know there's a name for that, but can't think of it off the top of my head) is always been delicious.  The seafood is extremely fresh, and all of the flavors are very good.  Attentive (but not at all annoying) service with friendly waitstaff, nice decor, and a great atmosphere for parties sized from 2 to 20."
1,A great way to spend the night.  Loved the seafood salad with soba noodles.   Asian cloppino and the filet have never disappointed.  Would love to try everything on the menu.
1,"If you are like me, and adore espresso martini's, you must check out Soba on Ellsworth Avenue! The martini is made of chilled espresso, vanilla vodka and Kahlua coffee liqueur. \n\nBy far the best espresso martini in the city!\n\nThey also have an excellent food menu for both the bar and restaurant.  They have happy hour specials and the bar is always filled with a great crowd!\n\nSoba is affiliated with the Big Burrito chain, along with Eleven, Kaya, Casbah and Umi: all of which are excellent restaurants!"
1,"Soba Saturday night after Art All Night! Whew there were so many people in Lawrenceville! It was impossible to get in anywhere and my group wasn't willing to stand outside in the brisk air just to get in and have to fight for seating or even a drink. Soba was the perfect choice! Love, love it here.\n\nI have been here to eat before but most nights it's such a busy place that we head elsewhere. Since all of Pittsburgh was on Butler St we got in and sat right down in the lounge next to the glass fireplace! I would love to do a photoshoot in this sexy space. There is always a romantic mood at Soba. Martini glasses clinking in a group cheers, a spectacular setting for a lovely evening and exciting conversation, discussing all the interesting art we just saw.\n\nYou have to try the Cucumber Martini, it is \""muah\"" marvelous! I think my drinks all summer will be Cucumber themed because it is so light and refreshing! \n\nI have this thing for Pad Thai, and I am searching the city for the best. So that is what I ordered last time I dined here. It was a pretty decent Pad Thai but I am still looking for one like I had years ago at Papermoon in Erie. It was the best I ever had in my life, no competitors yet. The appetizers I have tried are very good. This is an upscale dining establishment so expect that the food will be as well. They have a small lot that is always packed so you may have to drive around on the small side streets to find parking. I think this is one of the best spots in the city for a date night!"
1,"Dude.  Pittsburgh.  Who knew you had such a refined and sexy dining scene???\n\nWell, your good citizens, that's who.  Which is how husband and I were referred to Point Brugge, Salt of the Earth, and lastly Soba Lounge, thanks to the brilliant hostess at our B&B who told us Soba was her favorite spot within walking distance.  I don't usually dine without Yelping these days, but I am *so* glad we recklessly heeded her advice.  Our meal at Soba was one of the finest, most delicious, and wholly satisfying that I can recall (joining Salt of the Earth, no less, in that prestigious category...).\n\nThe subtle lighting and modern d\u00e9cor of the joint is coolly lovely, setting the mood right away for a relaxed dining experience.  Attentive, professional service is provided by servers who explain that most of the produce used in Soba's dishes is locally sourced and are happy to make recommendations.  Husband and I started out with an Asparagus Maki Roll appetizer, with tempura asparagus, tamago, roasted local shiitakes, scallion, and a spicy lemon ponzu.  The soft, sticky rice didn't overwhelm the crunchy asparagus, earthy 'shroom, and slightly-sweet tamago; the ponzu dip was a pleasantly sour foil.  We also had an order of Thai-inspired Blue Bay Mussels with crispy soba and aioli, which were *fab-u-lous.*  I eat a lot of mussels, but these were some of the most enjoyable I've ever had.\n\nFor entr\u00e9es, husband and I split the Soba Noodle Scallops -- which arrived at the table with root spinach, cuttlefish, wild mushroom, and fresh wasabi -- and the Seared Tuna -- with a sesame crust, cucumber-red-onion salad, kimchee, ginger fried rice, and peanuts.  Both dishes were out of this world.  Husband I had trouble cutting ourselves off at half and switching plates, but were both rewarded tenfold for doing so.  The scallops had a perfect sear, the soba was fat and chewy, the ponzu wasabi broth was soul-warming.  And the tuna was seared expertly, still gorgeously garnet and cool in the middle, complemented by a crunchy, nutty sesame crust and that flavorful rice.  I don't think either of us wanted that meal to end.  And all things considered, husband and I thought the bill at the end of the night was ridiculously reasonable.  Soba FTW.\n\nPittsburgh, I have a crush on you.  Your perfectly-priced fine-dining scene makes me want to pull up stakes and move in with you."
1,"I have dinned Soba on multiple occasions and it never disappoints.  I really like the decor (very fitting for menu served) and the wait staff is very knowledgeable about the menu. Since my standard practice is to ask what their favorite dishes and the most popular dishes are, a waitress/waiter that can give a detailed response is a big plus.    The wine menu is very thorough and my wife and i can always find a bottle that is both of high quality and reasonably priced.  For apps, we usually split the grilled baby octopus, if you have never had it, i highly suggest it. \n\nI was a little surprised on my most recent visit that they have removed the Sea Scallop entree from the menu,  my wife and i had both planned on getting this meal that evening.  I hope it returns soon, however, and a big however, the scallops were replaced with the miso black cod, which was absolutely fantastic.  one of those meals where eat bite is better than the next, the bbq ribs and noodles remain from the scallop dish but i believe there was a llittle more spice in this dish.  I also believe this is the famous miso black cod from next door at Umi, i could be wrong.   get this entree, it is amazing.  \n\nIn summary, Soba is great for a nice meal out, food is top notch, some of the best you will find in Pittsburgh, and of course i will return soon, yet again."
1,Loved it! Great vibe.
1,Love love love this place. They did an amazing job. Favorite place for happy hour.
1,"I love coming to Soba -- everything I have ever had here has been wonderful, from happy hour cocktails and appetizers to full course meals. I can never pass up the crispy tofu (which is also great at Mad Mex) -- it's the perfect balance of sweet and tart. For dinner, I realize the menu changes all the time, but if you ever come across it, I highly recommend the butternut squash soup as a starter. It's delicious! It's filling on its own (almost), but naturally I followed it with one of the noodle bowls with chicken, which was just spicy enough with flavorful chicken and vegetables.  The curry dishes are excellent, too. Soba service has always been friendly and attentive, and I love the dimly lit atmosphere and decor, particularly the waterfall wall. Meals are on the pricer side, but it's a nice night out, so it makes up for it (appetizers are around $12, meals are around $18-38 each).\n\nThey have excellent cocktails for happy hour, too, even if they are a bit on the pricey side ($10-13). Soba has great ambience for happy hour, too -- comfy seats and plenty of room for chatting. Whether you come here for a drink or a meal, it's always a pleasant experience."
1,"Amazing food, lovely atmosphere. Lot of the menu changes seasonally. We probably come here twice a month. I try to avoid ordering the same thing over an over (the fillet mignon is just outstanding), and I have never been disappointed.\n\nIt's a bit on the pricey side, but I think it's worth it for a date or even a group night out.\n\nThe upstairs covered patio area is great in the summer time."
1,"The crab meat corn-chowder appetizer is the finest appetizer I have ever had in my life. I have been to most of the great restaurants in New York City over the past 30 years, and that statement stands.\n\nJust fabulous."
1,My favorite place in Pittsburgh! The crispy  tofu there is so amazing! My next best dish is the thakkali curry.. The drinks specially the Asian plum sangria is fantastic.. Love the ambience! It's like a place in New York. Good veggie options.
1,"AMAZING! we had such a sublime experience here.  Service was wonderful, efficient, not fussy or intrusive.  The food?  Awesome!  We started with the crispy calamari and the crystal dumplings (?) or whatever they were called.  Both were delicious.\n\nJohn had the bibimbap and I had the duck, which we both agreed was the best duck we'd ever had.  Just perfect.\n\nWe're not big on desserts, but it was a special occasion, so we splurged.  John had the terrine and I had the ice cream sandwich, both very nice endings to a fantastic meal.  Can't wait to go again!"
1,"Amazing Two Fish Tempura Fat Roll...one of the best things I've tasted, seriously.\nExcellent Thai Corn Chowder.\nIncredible Black Cod.\nThis place does Asian Fusion well!"
1,"Johnnie knows exactly what to do with my hair, and as always it turns out fabulous! I've had bad experiences with hair cuts, but here I can always trust the staff!"
1,"You get what you pay for. I've never been even slightly disappointed. I've been coming here with a good friend for a few years, and it's a MUST every time I come back to town for a visit. \n\nOn our most recent visit I had the sushi platter entree. It comes with 8 pieces of nigiri sushi and a maki roll in the middle. The salmon nigiri is incredible. Eat it slowly.  SAVOR it!  I'm thinking about going back just for that one more time before I head back to Arizona. \n\nAlso, their desserts are exquisite.  The dessert menu changes, but again, I've never even come close to feeling disappointed.  I don't care much for sweets but the dessert here is SO good that I order something every time.  \n\nP.S. Don't wear a short skirt in case you get seated at a tatami table!"
1,"I believe I've found my new favorite restaurant. After being rather dissapointed with Chaya last night, I decided to go to Umi tonight.\n\nThe staff was friendly and service perfect. There servers watch for you to dictate the pace of the meal.\n\nBeggining with the typical salad with ginger dressing: I was very happy with this dressing, just about perfect.\n\nNext the miso soup: I'm not generally a huge fan of miso soup, but this was probably the best preparation I've had. I could have gone for another bowl. \n\nFor my entree I chose the dinner sushi assortment. This was by far the best sushi I've ever tasted. As cliche as it may sound, every piece (including fin which is notoriously tough) was melt in your mouth good.  The accompanying sauces are not overbearing in the least, they merely enhance the flavor of the fish.  The pieces of nigiri themselves are bite size - as in 1 bite without looking like you're stuffing your mouth.  This is smaller than the giant balls of rice with large cuts of fish you often times see at other places. I rather enjoyed the size, but just wanted to make note of it. The tuna roll was also very tasty. I did not sample any other rolls tonight, but I'm sure I will be back to do so.\n\nMy dining companion had the chicken teriyaki.  The dish came out sizzeling from the back kitchen.  Again, this was probably the best preperation of the dish I've ever tasted. The serving size was perfect, about 5oz of very tender breast meat, with accompanying vegetables and a small side of rice.  More than enough to satiate, without the need for a nap afterwards. \n\nI didn't sample the desserts tonight, but I've seen others rave about them. I will definitely be back, as often as I can. I don't really care to try sushi anywhere else in Pittsburgh."
1,Great sushi for serious sushi eaters.  The omakase is expensive but definitely the way to go. Quite the adventure.  The sauces the chef puts on the sushi/sashimi is what makes the difference.\n\nThe black cod dish is unbelievable.
1,"Anyone who says that there's no good sushi in Pittsburgh (and I've heard you say it, folks, right here on Yelp!) hasn't been to Umi yet. I'd been mostly satisfied, sushi-wise, by quality if standard places like Little Tokyo in the South Side and Chaya in Squirrel Hill before I went to Umi with my roommate last Saturday. \n\nThe first major difference between Umi and the places mentioned above: price. Umi, a Big Burrito joint, is much more expensive than other sushi places in town. That said, if you have the dough, go for the $75/person omakase. We enjoyed eight courses (7 dinner + 1 dessert course), each one subtle and well-seasoned and incredibly fresh. (Now we're broke, but that's my cross to bear.) The black cod and the nigiri course were stand-out favorites. The prices on the a-la-carte sushi, in contrast, looked only slightly more costly than others in town.\n\nThe second difference: innovation. Sometimes, I just want straight-up, unadorned sushi, and when I do, I doubt I'll come back to Umi. However, if I'm looking for a fine dining experience, one where the ingredients are creative and innovative, I'll definitely return here. One of the best meals I've had in PGH yet!\n\nA final caveat: don't forget to make a reservation. The restaurant was packed when we were there, and due to its small size, I doubt they can squeeze too many walk-ins in on a busy night."
1,"I'm going to start off by making the very bold statement that for most of last 10 years, Umi has been the best restaurant in Pittsburgh.  It's not just the best Japanese restaurant (which it is by an extraordinarily wide margin), but the best overall restaurant in the city.  Why such acclaim you might ask?  The answer lies in Umi's consistency in providing delicious cuisine with outstanding service.\n\nI'm embarrassed to say it, but when I first went to Umi about 10 years ago (has it been that long already?), I didn't like sushi.  I thought the texture was strange and it tasted too fishy.  The first time I had the omakase at Umi, the veil was lifted over my eyes.  Never had I imagined that Japanese food could be so delicious!  The constantly changing flavors and textures with each subsequent course was mind-spinning.  It would not be hyperbole to say that it was life-altering because it opened my eyes to the world of finer cuisine and made me want to seek out foods that I had been too afraid or stubborn to try in the past.\n\nOn a recent visit to Umi, I was surprised to see that there had been a change to the omakase menu.  It was always as big as you wanted to make it (like Troy Polamalu who likes the $250/person omakase), but now there were 3 options of a 7-course plus dessert, an 11-course plus dessert, and a \""trust Mr. Shu\"" omakase.  When I inquired what that meant, they said \""that's what the Steelers get.\""\n\nOn this occasion, my buddy and I got the 11-course omakase.  It was delicious as always and included a dizzying array of sashimi preparations, the much-acclaimed miso cod, and spicy and tender rock shrip tempura.  A very pleasant surprise was a new course served in two spoons.  One had poached lobster and the other had Kobe beef.  Each was covered with fois gras.  This was absolutely decadent and brought back memories for me of the fois gras sushi in O-Ya in Boston (which was the New York Times best new restaurant in the U.S. a few years ago).\n\nUmi's biggest criticism has always been that it's too expensive.  Although it's true that it can easily be the most expensive restaurant in Pittsburgh, you absolutely are getting your money's worth.  From very personal (and somewhat disappointing experience), high-end Japanese restaurants in bigger cities are just as good as Umi but MUCH more expensive (like sometimes twice as expensive).  I'll also make the bold statement that for what you get, Umi is a steal and Pittsburgh has been very lucky to have it.\n\nService is always outstanding.  On my most recent visit, Drew was our waiter who in my opinion is one of the nicest and best waiters in the city.  That really adds to the experience.  Also on my most recent visit to Umi, I was very pleasantly surprised that they had a free valet!  Parking has always been terrible in that portion of Ellsworth Ave.  The valet made it so simple, and it was free!  Kudos to Big Burrito for making that outstanding decision.\n\nI don't think it's fair to blame the restaurant for not seating you if you don't have a reservation.  Umi is very small and is always very crowded on the weekends.  As mentioned in other reviews, you can sit at the normal tables or the sunken \""traditional\"" Japanese tables.  Some advice from my wife is that if you're wearing a dress, don't sit at the sunken tables.  When you get up, you might be revealing more than you intend!"
1,"Seriously the best bagel in Pittsburgh.  Which, to be honest, isn't saying much.  We ain't a bagel town.  I will say the cream cheese is straight bomb dot com.  The coffee is also pretty great in my opinion.  My partner always gets the lemonade and is a bit addicted to it.  It is incredibly refreshing.    \nThe main dude that everyone seems to have difficulty with based on these reviews is a bit eccentric but we've never had an off putting experience with him.  He's just a bit socially awkward, not intentionally malicious.  I find the staff to be downright pleasant.  I don't know, we've always been nice there and we're always treated well in return.  Additionally whenever I've seen situations where someone's order was wrong/not what they wanted, the staff addressed to problems with great professionalism."
1,"My go to spot when I just want to relax with some friends.  Great drinks and craft beer selection is coupled with very good food.  Make sure to checkout the lounge upstairs during those cold winter months.  During the summer grab a seat on either the front patio for people watching, or the back patio for a nice quiet and private drink.  Good brunch turns great once the patios are closed, as the brunch buffet becomes a la carte.  This brings about the Breakfast Smil... err, Simile.  Home fries, bacon, sausage, eggs, and pancakes all on one giant plate."
1,"I ate at the Harris Grill for the first time last night, and it was fantastic! It will not be my last time there. The staff was very friendly and welcoming! I ordered a Surly Temple, which was cherry and fizzy, and perfect for enjoying. It was a tad cool on the front patio to enjoy the whole drink, but this will definitely be my summer drink!\n\nMy boyfriend and I started out with the hummus and pita bread. I ate half of it before he had any! Oops! It was really great hummus!! I could have stopped here and been really happy, but I was hungry, so I ordered the mac and cheese and added grilled chicken. Oh holy cow!! This mac and cheese is cheesy, but not overly so. It's the perfect amount of gooey for mac and cheese. The chicken was seasoned, tender, and not dry. Great mac and cheese!!\n\nI'm already looking forward to my next trip to Harris Grill!!"
1,"This is a place where I've never even had a just-OK experience. Every time I come in, I have an enjoyable meal and a killer cocktail or several. If you like Manhattans, I implore you to work your way down their list of variations (over several visits, if you want to remember where you live when you leave).\n\nThe last time I went in, I had a splendid hummus and pita plate -- and although the pita ran out before the hummus, my request for more pita was immediately handled, with no critique of my rationing capabilities.\n\nIf hummus is not your thing, 1) I don't understand you one bit, but 2) try their baby burgers, the arugula steak salad, or the \""labor-inducing vegetarian chili\"". They all have my seal of approval.\n\nLastly, if you like bacon, be sure to try this place out on a Tuesday. That's Bacon Night, and Harris serves it at the bar in baskets of four -- free of charge until they run out for the night. If you're dining at a table it's a buck a basket, but you can still eat to your heart's (dis)content."
1,"Fantastically Happy place to eat!\n\nThe building looks like the remains of an old house.  The walk to the hostess is a bit awkward as you're walking through the front patio full of guests already enjoying their meal.  That not really being an issue, you'll step into the 'foyer' where you're greeted and offered various seating options.\n\nWe were escorted upstairs to a cute dining area with large windows and a very charming ambiance.  We were seated and not shortly after were greeted by our server... 'Shipwreck'.\n\nYeah, I'm not kidding... He said his name was \""Shipwreck\"", even after questioning him... this set the tone for the night.  He was very knowledgeable of both the liquor and food menus and was jolly, and appeared to really love his job; Attentive and courteous as well as entertaining.\n\nThe food was amazing!  When you go, if you're like me, you'll be snapping photos of the names they have come up with for the array of 'American Cuisine'.  Things like the \""spin spin sugar' Salad, or the \""Aw, you're pullin' my pork\"" pork sandwich.  Everything was geared toward putting a smile on my face; and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.\n\nNext time I visit Pittsburgh; I'm definitely stopping in again.  Probably one of the most memorable dinners out in a while!  Thank you."
1,"I normally avoid brunch buffets as a rule; the food is never up to par and it's a cattle call. Usually a poor excuse for restaurants to make money. However, when a local friend suggested we meet here he insisted Harris Grill's brunch was legit. He had me at \""bacon trough\"".\n\nNice patio seating and friendly service! You get a frozen mimosa (and it's not overly sweet or weak; actually tastes like a frozen mimosa) or bloody mary with the $15 all you can eat brunch. Omelets made to order, lox and mini bagels, fresh fruit, trough of well done, really quality bacon as previously mentioned. There's even pre-assembled eggs benedict, which I expected to be a mess but they were perfect. \n\nI wish all brunch buffets were like this. It is a tiny bit cramped when there are several people loading up plates, but everyone was understanding and laughed off the occasional bumps. Brunch is serious business, you do what you gotta do."
1,"Harris is the best.  Good beer, good bar food, good juke box, decent outdoor seating and all of the Pittsburgh charm you would want from your bartenders, servers and management.  It's my go-to bar when I'm in the Burgh. \n\nIt's a bar; it's a good bar--if you're looking for life changing event I would recommend staying home and punching yourself in the face, since you're likely a Nickelback loving douche."
1,"I grew up in Pittsburgh and now live in San Jose, CA. Every time I return to Pittsburgh, I make make it a point to stop at Hey Betty! I can tell you we do not have stores like this where I live now and the vintage shops we do have charge five times the price. It does take some searching around to find things, so if you are a person who likes to discover treasures, you will likely be rewarded. The store is small and packed. If you are impatient, like me, it's best to ask if you're looking for something specific. Sandra and Michael know their merchandise but they are not intrusive and do not try to push things on you. I have things from there that span decades. The last trip we scored the most amazing pair of sunglasses ever made."
1,"I LOVE THIS PLACE.  It is less expensive than area hotels:  for less than the price of one normal hotel room at a hotel located in a less desirable area, you get your own apartment nestled comfortably in Shadyside.  You really become a resident of the area and don't feel much like a guest.\n\nThe customer service was great over the phone.  We were given the university rate for the room due to my father's affiliation with Pitt, and that made a good deal even better.  There's fancy cable, enough room that a family of four won't trip all over each other, and one of my favorite hoods within a short walking distance.  I LOVE THIS PLACE.  \n\nI recommend it without reservation.  Truly."
1,"This place is awesome. Immaculately clean, lots of natural light in every room of the enormous suites, modern decor, great location, and amazing customer service. You really feel like you are at home. Such a wonderful experience. I will definitely be a returning guest."
1,"Everything about our experience was wonderful!!  We had made a reservation because we had a large party - our table was ready and waiting for us (this was a Friday night about 6:30). Our waitress was friendly and kept up with our many requests - from drinks to appetizers to dinner.  The food all came out together - (we had salads, burgers, seafood entree) so there was a variety and everyone was pleased with their dinners.  Will definitely go back!!"
1,This place is definitely great. Any entree I have had has been excellent.. The service is great too. Bartender is very friendly and the atmosphere is very nice ! I'm going to be a regular for sure!
1,"It started out as a place where I would occasionally come for a few drinks.  They were good.  White sangria topped with champagne and the vodka-infused fruit.  Then, a few big fish sandwiches.  A little apple pie crunch thing with vanilla ice cream.  Dinner specials.  After a long day of work, preordered dinner specials.  The Elbow Room crept into my heart and swept me off my feet.  While I found most of the food delicious and tasty, there were a few meh dishes, but that was easily overlooked by the outstanding service.  Everyone who has waited on me has been kind, friendly, and personable.  The atmosphere is laid back and excellent for unwinding.  Love.  Love.  Love."
1,Always enjoy coming to The Elbow Room. Atmosphere is great. Food is great. Jason was our server. He did an excellent job! Highly recommend asking for Jason.
1,"I've been using this store for about a year now. Recently I took a very dirty cashmere sweater of my husband's, who carelessly spilt glue and other unidentifiable sticky stuff all over. It was navy colored sweater and the yellow glue residues stood out like highlights! I tried to take these off at home, but gave up. Even when I took it to footer's, I truthfully did not expect it to come clean. The owner lady said she would do her best and she kept her word! The sweater is 95% clean now - their work far exceeds my expectation. Plus, the owner lady is always nice and helpful."
1,"This is where I always get my haircut and color by Richard, my fav hair stylist in Pittsburgh! I was referred to Richard by a friend with a favor card. Richard is excellent in asking the right questions and making sure he understands the customers' boundaries, but I decided to become adventurous because I was so bored with my hair and I gave him some basic boundaries to comply with but told him he has my blessings to get creative! I didn't like my haircut at all, and felt very very bad! I went home and decided to take a shower and style my hair my way and I LOVED it!! It turned out it was just the way he styled it that I didn't like but the haircut was BRILLIANT! Since that day, I became a loyal customer and never went somewhere else! I had a hair color and highlights, and Richard was extremely cooperative and made sure I loved my hair color, I even called him and complained about some little detail I didn't like, and he had me come over and fixed it without charging me. Besides Richard high talent and high tolerance, the service in this place is excellent and very accommodating. It's clean and parking was never a problem."
1,Krista is a hair wizard. Not only do I love the cut and colour of my hair I love how well informed she keeps me about everything she's doing to my hair. Her product knowledge is out of this world and she seems to really love making people look good. I would never trust anyone else with my hair.
1,"What a great neighbourhood joint!  I can't speak to the food as we stopped there after dinner - but parked ourselves at the bar to watch a baseball game and have a few drinks. We were visiting Pittsburgh from California, and popped in on our way back to the hotel. Owner Brian Carey mans the bar and keeps the casual atmosphere going with lighthearted banter. Stick around long enough and you will meet staff and owners from other local waterholes, or maybe even your local councilman. It's a great little place w/irish pub ambiance. Make sure to pop your head in for a drink or two on a Thursday night - you never know who might show up - like the Bud guy or the Jagermeister girls - it's a busy place, and a lot of fun, w/great staff and an owner who cares - this is as close to CHEERS as you'll ever get"
1,"Come here for the jelly sandwich cookies. BEST jelly sandwich cookies ever. they're round, 2 layers, powdered sugar, and you can see the jam in a little cut out circle on the top layer. Their \""burnt almond torte cake\"" is supposed to be really famous, but i always got distracted by the cookies..."
1,"Pastries, brownies, doughnuts, breads, cakes, cupcakes, cookies, danishes, muffins, and more.  Reasonable prices and fresh goodies!  \n\nToday was my first experience at Pranti's.  BF and I walked in and it was packed but the wait was not long before someone asked what we wanted.  \n\nMy eyes darted back and forth trying to pick something.  That was a challenge.., Finally after talking to the counter girl, my BF, and myself I decided to go with a brownie and a cookie.  BF picked a doughnut.  The bill came to under $4 bucks.  \n\nThe chocolate chip cookie was as thick as a blondie bar but bigger in circumference.  \n\nThe brownie was enormous and has walnuts in it.  \n\nThe doughnut was chocolate and vanilla frosted and my man ate it up within 2 seconds flat.  \n\nAddicting!  Delicious baked treats.\n\nThe coffee cakes here with the white powdery stuff on top looked so good.  Maybe next time...."
1,"This place is the BOMB DOT COM.\n\n{does anyone still say that? I'm 30 and so out of touch with reality}\n\nBut I do know dessert and it's official. This place has the very best burnt almond torte ever. If you're reading this and thinking that sounds gross, it's not. It's basically a piece of the most moist cake you'll ever eat covered with slivered almonds and other goodness I can't describe. All these people below me can't be wrong.\n\nSo good that you'll rip open the box in the car and realize you don't have a fork but devour it with your hands because it's that good. I might have some experience in that department. Mayyyyyybe.\n\nEat cake."
1,"I generally am not a fan of baked goods. HOWEVER, Prantl's has me coming back and wanting more.\n\nThe toasted almond cups are to die for. GET. THEM. I believe it's a mini version of their burnt almond torte? Either way, ah-mazing.\n\nI even liked their donuts! I never eat donuts. The only donuts I ever liked in my life were Krispy Kreme's original glazed donuts. After KK died, I have never enjoyed a donut since. However, today at Prantl's, their glazed donut was calling to me. Ohmygosh. I devoured that thing in literally five seconds.\n\nIn one word, yum."
1,"I don't even like cake, but, the best dessert I have ever had is the Burnt Almond Torte from Prantl's! It is so delicious, nothing compares!"
1,"I can only speak to the burnt almond torte from Shadyside.  After all, why would you buy anything else in a store when you could buy one of the most heavenly cakes on earth?  I have been eating this cake since childhood.  It is a favorite.    \n\nWhoever invented this torte deserves a medal.  I thank you most sincerely.  You've gotta eat it cold so you can experience the thick texture of the icing with the crisp but not too crunchy coating of slivered almonds.  And though the icing is sweet, it is cut by the creamy coolness of the vanilla custard and light white cake.  Somewhere in there is just the right slight taste of salt.  Heaven, pure heaven.\n\nGreat tip: My brother had it as his wedding cake.  The store made three inexpensive fake round cakes that looked like burnt almond tortes and were on pedestals of varying height with beautiful fresh flowers at the base.  You never, ever would have known they were fake.  (I know it sounds super tacky but was not.)  Meanwhile, the actual burnt almond torte was delivered in sheet pans and cut in the back.  So much more cost effective than having some over the top looking wedding cake.  It looked beautiful and tasted so, so good.  Out of towners who had never had Prantl's were amazed."
1,The cinnamon rolls are so good. They are almost half cream cheese icing which is delicious. Plan to be in a sugar coma afterward but its so worth it! The red velvet looked good but I felt too guilty to order more after ordering all five of the cinnamon rolls they had left :)
1,"After falling in love with the burnt almond torte while living in PGH, we wanted to have it at our California wedding.  Recent publicity meant they were not able to ship the cakes for us.  \n\nThankfully they were very responsive to email questions and requests and made it very easy for a friend to ship the cakes for us.  They arrived in perfect condition and were delicious."
1,"Amazing pastries! Gotta go and check it out.  We had the almond tort, cream horn and the gob. All great! Reasonable prices too."
1,"Oh, baked almond torte, how I love you. Why, though, must you be so caloric!?!  It distresses me that I must save you for special occasions."
1,"MY OH MY can prantl's make a Cali girl feel like she's in heaven!\n\nCame here today for the famous almond torte and left with an almond torte, apple strudel, and a pizza roll. All reminded me of Beyonce, they were friggin fabulous. \n\nI did have to scrape some of the torte's frosting off because I did not want to overdue the sweets. I normally do this with cakes and cupcakes so this is not a diss to Prantl's. It is a diss to myself for not being a part of the frosting is the best part of the cake club. Definitely recommend this place to anyone who is in town!"
1,"Best desserts I've ever eaten. While I am a chocolate girl normally, I have to agree the burnt almond torte is out of this world. For a smaller version try the burnt almond cup...about the size of half a small cupcake, but just as delicious and a very controlled portion. Not that i was interested in this this weekend...my husband and I got a variety of cups...2 dozen to be exact with plans to take them out to friends and family. Our friends and family got some of the second dozen, but we housed the first and a few of the second.\n\nNext to the burnt almond cup (I've only had the cups) my favorites were the red velvet (take that all you stupid cupcake trucks), the german chocolate and the white chocolate rasperry. But they were all good...I couldn't say any were something I wouldn't steal from a small child. I love how all the cups these are like sushi in their delivery.you get a bit of everything in each small bite.\n\nOne thing to be aware of...some of their cups are *very* sweet so if you're not a fan of sugar I might suggest the tiramisu or german choclate...they are a little less sugary than the rest."
1,"A Pittsburgh gem.  I adore Prantl's Bakery. It is a must visit if you have friends or family in town. They have a tasty selection of pastries, cakes, cookies and donuts.  Each more sugary and delicious than the next. By far my favorite are the small cake cups.  The perfect little treat while shopping along Walnut St. There are so many flavors to chose from but I can never go past the classic burnt almond custard cup or the seasonal pumpkin cake  cup. That buttercream frosting is heaven!   Also, hats off to the staff who maintain composure even in the midst of the weekend onslaught when people pack in like sardines to get their sweet fix."
1,"My favorite coffee shop on Walnut St.  Most of the folks in there are regulars who greet each ohter by name.  I did my job search there this winter so I was in daily and I too, got to know everyone there.\n\nThe coffee is great, the staff is friendly, and they have free wireless.  One day I couldn't get the wireless to work and the guy who does their IT just happened to be in the shop, and not only did he set my wireless up for me (which he didn't have to do), he also fixed my computer which he REALLY didn't have to do.\n\nThis place has a warm, friendly, welcoming environment and is a lot quieter that hte coffee tree.  It is my fave coffee shop! \n\nThe also serve ice cream, and have outdoor seating which is perfect for summertime."
1,"This is by far my favorite place to get coffee ever. If you are a student, or maybe a recent graduate in need of Internet this is the place to go. Grab a coffee and grab a seat inside or outside and enjoy using the Internet as long as you like. NO TIME LIMIT!"
1,"Their coffee is solid--better than coffee tree roasters, imo--and the atmosphere is nice and relaxed. Prefer this place over the local chains any day."
1,"Despite the kooky spelling, Kards Unlimited is a great place to shop for a gift. The card selection is extensive, so if you go there in search of a card you're unlikely to head home empty-handed. Even better, there's a wide assortment of knick-knacks and books that are perfect as gifts or impulse purchases for yourself. It's easy to lose track of time as you wander up and down the narrow aisles."
1,"Such a great store. They stock everything (EVERYTHING), including: cards, hand puppets, necklaces, books, etc... Kards Unlimited seems to take great care in choosing store products for sale. Definitely my favorite store on Walnut."
1,"They have a huge selection of greeting cards in the back, but I've usually come here to browse the books (lots of Kurt Vonnegut) or the stationary and other gifts like that (notepads like \""While you were out\"" but with snarky commentary). Not only do you have a ton of options here, but they're very well curated options. One of the very best gift shops around!"
1,"This is a gem in Shadyside. I make sure to stop in here every time I'm in Shadyside. It's a perfect little novelty store equipped with funny quirky cards, books, T-shirts, and little stocking stuffers and the like. To be honest, it's a little expensive and I generally don't buy anything while I'm here, but it's the perfect little place to browse on a Sunday afternoon stroll on Walnut Street with a coffee. I lived in Shadyside for a while and grabbing coffee next door at Tree Roasters and walking in here for a peek became a part of my weekend schedule."
1,"Without a doubt one of the nicest places I have ever had the pleasure of laying my head...\n\n...having wine and cheese...\n\n....or breakfasting.\n\nThe Inn on Negley is gorgeously appointed.  The individual rooms, all named for varieties of apple, are spectacular.  We were in the lovely Northern Spy.  The bed was wonderfully comfortable, the linens unbelievably soft and luxurious.  L'Occitane bath products smelled divine.  The Shadyside neighborhood outside of downtown is quiet but still conveniently located to all the Pittsburgh doings.\n\nBreakfast each morning, cooked by the hospitable Chef Jackie, is pure pleasure.  Each night on your pillow a menu card appears; check off what you'd like in the morning, what time you'll be eating, and drop it off in the dining room.  The next day, Jackie is ready and waiting with a fresh fruit plate, the pastry of the day, and fantastically strong and flavorful coffee.  Omelets and fritattas are made with local produce and eggs.  Irish oatmeal is served with milk from a nearby creamery.  Toast bread changes daily but is always whole-grain and delicious.  Breakfast meats are lean and filling.  \n\nAfternoons, iced tea and cookies are set out, and in the evenings wine and cheese served.  Enjoy them in a rocker on the front porch, relaxing on the back deck retreat, or in the privacy of your room.  \n\nStaff is not only eminently professional, but warm and gracious.  Heidi at the front desk was beyond helpful in making suggestions for what to do in the city or where to eat (I will be forever indebted to her for recommending what was probably our best meal of the trip at Soba).  If you ever find yourself in Pittsburgh, lodgings can't get much better than the Inn on Negley.\n\nThat's probably sufficient gushing."
1,"Amazing!\n\nI recently hosted my friend's bridal shower here and everything was absolutely perfect!  Heidi went above and beyond helping me plan from 3 hours away, including taking pictures of the tea room and promptly responding to my many many emails. The Inn itself is gorgeous, and the staff was extremely professional and accommodating. \n\nA++++!!!"
1,"What a wonderful location!  My sister's future MIL hosted her bridal shower here and with 11 people, we had our own private room.  It was tastefully decorated and beautiful.  The Inn on Negley also has a private parking lot in the back meant for their guests but street parking is plentiful around there, as well.\n\nThe tea room is simply gorgeous and the variety of tea is plentiful and delicious!  They even had a blue & yellow tea for us (the bride's wedding colors) and I loved the fact that we could request a different type of tea the second time around.  The food was delicious from the cucumber finger sandwiches to the apricot scones.\n\nWhat a lovely spot for afternoon tea and I look forward to returning again to Pittsburgh - may want to stay there next time!"
1,First time having Afternoon tea time in the States. This place is very beautifully decorated. We had the Earl Grey and peach ginger tea. They were really good and the tea stand was AMAZING
1,"I love this little grocer. They prepare little bentos (perfect for lunch while you do your laundry) and have a ton of niche items you can't get anywhere else. Plus, the produce and seafood is some of the best in the city. If you haven't found this place, then stay away, I don't want my selection lessening."
1,"The bento lunches made by the owners at Tokyo Japanese Food Store are the bomb!! They satisfy any Japanese food craving that I might have. They typically either have something fried or grilled along with a small salad, rice and some other tiny sides, which can be found in the fridge in the back of the store.\n\nIf you want to make any type of Japanese food this store would have anything that you would need though a little pricey. However their fresh fish is out of the world if you want to make your own sushi or sashimi. I also bought the largest carrot that I have ever seen (for under a buck!) to go with a cold soba noodle dish that I was making. \n\nYou won't regret popping in here as the owners take pride in their shop and keep it clean and all food fresh though note there is a $10 minimum for credit card."
1,"\""Sugoi! Suki! Hontou!\"" (Wow! Love it! Really!)\n\nJust a few of the cute little responses the cashier exclaimed as she rang my items up (I'd like to thank anime for my informal understanding of the Japanese language). \n\nTokyo Japanese is one of the most comprehensive Japanese groceries I've been to. Sure there are other Asian groceries where you'll find common items like soy sauce and pocky sticks, but when it comes to rare Japanese cooking staples, look no further. I loaded up on shiratamako, fukujinzuke, natto, okonomiyaki sauce, okonomiyaki flour, takoyaki flour, shimeji mushrooms, tenkasu, yakisoba noodles, and more. They also have sushi grade fish, produce, bento boxes, and baked goods -- all fresh. I couldn't not find anything if I tried.\n\nThe staff is very pleasant and friendly. Some items can be pricey, but they are the harder to find items that justify the cost. \n\nTokyo Japanese is as sugoi as it gets, so they get 4.5 stars rounded up."
1,"I was looking for something Japanese around me but had no luck until I came across this place, the prices are fair. I don't understand why people are complaining about the price, it's coming from japan! Of course it will be more than the American junk candy. The food is very fresh and extremely good for the price, I bought a big list of stuff and I would buy out the entire store if I had the money. They are very kind and nice, polite and funny. They are willing to help you out and they give you a nice verity of food and items for a little shop they are. I would highly suggest going there, the food is healthier for you and isn't much more than our typical everyday food. They have certainly got me wanting to go back for more."
1,I have been here a few times and always find something new to try. The staff are a delight and I have great back and forth banter with the elder gentleman who is usually at the counter. \n\nMy latest visit here was to get supplies for a friends Hot Pot night. Both of the staff were incredibly helpful with my questions. They directed me towards the best cuts of meat (I knew thin cut beef and pork worked well but not the specific type - i.e. fatty or lean). There was a great selection and variety of fresh vegetables which were well priced. Self control with respect to the assortment of red bean paste-based sweets was difficult but I managed!
1,Great place to go. Friday and Saturdays are busy. Good prices for shady side.
1,"What's with the bitter reviews? I live in San Francisco, and even I miss Market District! It's one of the best grocery stores I've ever seen in a proper city. Folks from upstate NY like to boast about Wegmans, but you only get 6+ prepared food buffets if you have nearly infinite floor space. Giant Eagle: Market District makes great use of their limited space. My favorite things:\n\n-charmingly confusing store layout\n-happiest store employee I've EVER met -- the guy who hands out cookie samples is so enthusiastic\n-polite cashiers\n-walk-in cheese closet\n\nTransportation is easy for CMU students (B shuttle stops here). It's also on several major bus lines because it's on Centre Ave. Unfortunately, parking is the worst ever. Turning left out of the parking area is a nightmare and takes upwards of 3-4 minutes. Trying to turn left onto Centre during rush hour? Forget it. No matter where you're going, just turn right and resign yourself to driving really far out of your way."
1,My local grocery store.They just remodeled the cafe and dining area- looks beautiful and is spacious. They sell beer now. Also has a deli and cheese section. Gets crowded in the afternoons.
1,"When I started looking for an engagement ring for my wife, a friend recommended Henne Jewelers. From the moment I walked in, to the moment I bought my wife's engagement ring, I loved the experience! The staff was extremely helpful and genuinely caring. In fact, they told me about their \""To Have and to Hold\"" program. In the program, the Henne's will offer couples a financial incentive on a couples purchase if they commit to going through premarital counseling. They told me that, \""Most people spend more time planning for their wedding day than they do for their married life.\"" I couldn't agree more. My wife and I went through premarital counseling and it was extremely beneficial to us. \n\nWe had such a great experience buying the engagement ring their that we also bought our wedding bands there. When we went in this time, co-owner, John Henne, handed me and my wife a book called, \""Things I Wish I Knew Before I got Married\"" by Gary Chapman, to help us prepare even more. \n\nNow, I recommend Henne to everyone I know. They don't just care about making a sale, they care about the couple, and that made all the difference in the world to us.  Finally, in addition to the excellent customer service described above, the jewelry that we purchased is of the highest quality and style.  My wife was thrilled with the engagement ring I selected and we both love our wedding bands."
1,"I've recently moved away from Pittsburgh, and Girasole is one of the places I miss the most. It's tiny and can be loud, but the food is amazing, the atmosphere is fantastic, and I can't wait to go back. I'd especially recommend the pumpkin ravioli, which appears on the menu in the fall. \n\nBecause it is small, it's well worth calling ahead for a reservation. Otherwise they will take your name and cell phone number, and you're free to wander around Shadyside until a table opens up."
1,"Girasole is a great, little restaurant just off Walnut.  I love the cozy atmosphere and the decor.  I LOVE the salad and escarole & beans.  Perfect!  Vito, the owner/waiter is awesome.  They do a great job.  I think you can have parties there on Monday evenings (that take up the whole space), FYI."
1,5 stars. 'Nuf said.
1,"The food is incredible!! Despite getting caught in a thunderstorm, and having to wait in an awkwardly crowded area, it was totally worth it!! This was my first visit to Girasole. We were a group of 5 celebrating my daughters engagement. Shared a bottiglia di vino.  All of our dinners came with a fresh salad with sunflower seeds and a nice vinaigrette dressing and blue cheese. I ordered the fish, which was salmon. Unbelievable!! It was served over an artichoke pur\u00e9e and was cooked to perfection. Everyone tremendously enjoyed not only the food, but the atmosphere as well. A man was playing acoustic guitar Italian music. I am Italian, and this was the real deal!  I will definitely be going back!!! Love this place!!"
1,Girasole is a great Italian restaurant in shadyside. Make a reservation. . . it gets crowded and hectic on Friday and Staurday nights. It's small on space but big on atmosphere from the neghborhood to the patio seating to the decor!  The gnocchi is fantastic. They have a pretty broad italian wine list and great deserts. Not too terible on the wallet. Only gripe is the small real estate inside which tends to lead to slightly cramped seating.
1,www.bigtsreviews.com
1,"Girasole is a great example of authentic, traditional Italian food.  My boyfriend and I have made this restaurant one of our date-night staples! It is BYOB so feel free to bring your favorite bottle to enjoy with your meal.  They have a rotating seasonal menu that offers daily chicken, fish and meat specials.  Each meal comes with a house salad and a side of bread. \n\nThe restaurant is great at accommodating your dietary needs. I came with my family for my graduation and they were able to accommodate my mom who has Celiac (an allergy to gluten) without any problems!   \n\nI have to admit, if you come here it's definitely for the food. The restaurant is small (which creates a romantic setting) and the tables are very close together (which helps you make friends with your neighbors)! The servers do a great job of tending to their guests and making the best of the situation and the restaurant can feel cramped, loud and chaotic if you are not ready for it.  You are definitely better off making a reservation, but keep in mind that t doesn't always guarantee that your table will be available at that specified time. \n\nI recommend going to Girasole on your next date night with an open mind and taking the time to enjoy the food and atmosphere, since that is what makes Girasole one of the best restaurants in Shadyside!"
1,"Beautiful ambiance, fantastic service, delicious food, and a personal toast from the owner was a great touch!"
1,"Food, service and atmosphere were excellent. I don't ever post reviews but couldn't believe this place didn't have a higher rating."
1,"This place has authentic peruvian food and tasty american style peruvian sandwiches.  Every day they have a choice of two or three vegetarian and two or three non vegetarian entrees.  They serve these with rice and side salad.  My favorites are pumpkin and potato stew and potato, cheese, and pea casserole.  They also make a great egg salad sandwich with guacamole.  The homemade sweet potato chips and alfajores (shortbread cookies filled with caramel sauce and dusted with powdered sugar) are must haves."
1,"La Feria recently changed their menu, so I thought I'd post a review about their new system. \n\nThey've replaced the rotating daily specials with a larger menu. The classics are still on the menu (like the delicious ropa vieja) but now it's expanded to include things like their cheese and potato stew. \n\nAs you'd expect, everything is delicious. It's also worth noting that the service is quick and friendly and there's a whole section where you can shop/peruse Peruvian folk art and goods while you wait for your food. \n\nWhat can I say? I love La Feria."
1,"Can't emphasize enough how great this place is. It makes me sad that everyone goes to Pamela's when La Feria is right above it - I always go here for breakfast/brunch and am always extremely satisfied.\n\nIt's a great environment: La Feria, in addition to a restaurant, also acts as a Peruvian shop. They sell clothes, toys, and even amazing chess sets. The seating is cozy, the people are friendly, and the food comes out pretty quickly.\n\nSpeaking of food: It's fantastic. You'll pretty much always want to get one of the specials; each day they have a meat special and a vegetable special, but both are always great. The special (which usually consists of meat and vegetables) comes with garlic rice, salad (with onions, tomato, olives, cheese, and walnuts), and French bread. It's $10.95, which might be a bit expensive, but it'll definitely fill you up, and every bite will be delicious. Maybe you'll even have some to take home!\n\nIf you don't get one of the specials, go for the ropa vieja - beef slow-cooked with tomatoes. Still $10.95, still comes with rice/salad/bread, still delicious.\n\nBonus: La Feria has great Peruvian coffee!"
1,"This place is amazing! First time here and it's a small place. Couldn't find it at first because its above Pamela's. needs a sign! \n\nAnyway, the food is incredible! I had the Triple Sandwich and it was WAY MORE than I expected. Taste is amazing. Sweet Potato chips were perfect. Definitely recommend it! :D"
1,"Fantastic service! I needed to get my engagement ring sized down and saw the great reviews The Collection had and decided to give them a call. I had my ring resized in a matter of about an hour. It came back nicely cleaned and polished and finally fits! Kerry was so nice and professional and I felt like I could trust them. Love it, thanks!"
1,"My personal favorite Pittsburgh bar. Notorious for fresh juice and strong drinks. For the first few years I lived in pgh this was our standard last stop before heading home. Not once did I remember leaving the bar. Things have slowed down a bit since then, mostly because I've also learned to never order more then two drinks. It's also tiny, so if you want to sit down, get there early (or go during the week). Weekend crowds are ass to crotch throughout the entire place."
1,"This is a total hidden gem. I was unaware that this bar existed till a friend took me here. We were sitting across the street at Mario's and he says to me, \""You want to go some place else and get some STRONG drinks?\"" This proposition not only got me excited, but piqued my interest. Where are we going and why don't I know about this place?\n\nOnce we made it inside and up the long set of stairs (I can see myself taking a digger down these after a few Manhattens) you enter the dark, semi smokey bar. This place is divey but not dirty. It just looks they decorated it about 25 years ago and if it was good enough then, damnit its good enough now. The juke box is loaded with classic jazz and blues and normally operates at the guidance of the bartender (which is fine by me, he has good taste.)\n\nThe bartender is one of those guys whose career has been behind the bar. He makes his drinks fast, tall, and strong. The average cocktail (whiskey and coke, vodka and juice, gin and tonic) run about $6 and some of their others (Manhattan, martinis, etc) cost $8. The prices are higher than some may be used to, but relax, its worth it. You are getting a rocks glass with little ice, filled nearly to the top with your booze of choice, and a mist of whatever else you wanted to water down the drink. If I'm going to spend $15 in a bar I would rather drink 2 well made, strong drinks than drink 15 cups of coke each with an eye dropper's worth whiskey.  \n\nIf you want a place to listen to some good music, get schwacked on liquor, and enjoy some conversation, Mardi Gras is you joint."
1,This is without a doubt the best alcoholic's bar in Shadyside. Smoking permitted. Extremely strong cocktails. The downside is that its a bit pricey but you are compensated well in alcohol. The bartenders are good people. Downsides: poorly lit - on weekends it can get a bit packed - so packed that you have to stand and in such a small space that's a bit uncomfortable.
1,"I moved to California ~2 years ago and miss Mardi Gras more than anything else. Richie and crew provided a home for all, the writers, designers, storytellers and more who found ourselves adrift and looking to share our story. Can't wait to get back one day."
1,"Great portions, homey service, homey atmosphere, reasonable prices. Classic."
1,"We met a group of friends at Pamela's for brunch, it was my first time at the restaurant and I loved it. This no-frills place serves the best pancakes that I have eaten in a long time. I had their Blueberry pancakes as part of my breakfast combo. My friends had the strawberry pancakes and the french toast with walnuts. All three dishes were delicious (my mouth is watering just thinking about that meal). \n\nThe pancakes are sort of in between flapjacks and crepes, and the blueberries (fresh ones) were folded into the pancake with sour cream  and brown sugar (which complimented the blueberries beautifully).  The rest of my breakfast was tasty too, but nothing to write home about, especially compared to the pancakes. \n\nThey get very crowded and they will not seat you until your entire party is ready to be seated. Also, they do not accept credit cards (CASH ONLY)."
1,"you must come here, and you may even want to dedicate 2 separate breakfast/brunch meals here! \n\nhotcakes are the specialty, and you can get them a variety of ways. they're really good plain, but also super delish with the stuff in it (ie banana choco chip, blueberry, strawberry). personal fav is the strawberry or plain. i usually get plain hotcakes sans butter, and sprinkle granulated sugar on =)\n\nother things to try: corned beef hash is yummmmy. \n\nout of all the pamela's, i like this one the best. this is also the place i mist most from pitts=( it's soooooooooo greasy delicious awesome."
1,"New Yorkers.... if you like Clinton St. Bakery, this is Pittsburgh's answer. Their pancakes are the best I ever had. I had banana walnut once that was unbelievable. I am a sucker for corned beef hash and this was the best I've had as well. Really, this place is a national treasure."
1,"one of the best places for breakfast ever. It gets packed every weekend with students, parents, and locals alike. don't be afraid to put your name in and wait the little bit to get an amazing breakfast. the interior is pretty festive with old school board games all over the walls and ceiling. Has some of the standards of breakfast such as pancakes (hotcakes), eggs, omelets, etc  but also has their spin on it. \n\nthis is a cash only restaurant so make sure that you have plenty of cash in order to pay for this meal. I really liked the western style omelet that i got which had chorizo sausage in it. so good"
1,One of the best breakfasts ever. Awesome diner feel. Friendly service. Delicious corned beef hash. Addictive. And the best pancakes i've ever eaten - really unique and perfect texture. I wish i had a place like this near me. As good as it gets.
1,Blueberry pancakes were amazing
1,"Excellent food. Great omelettes, great pan-cakes, everything is excellent!"
1,Oh my goodness I absolutely love this place! Strawberry hotcakes have brown sugar creme cheese and whipped cream! Also love the chorizo sausage with eggs n hash! Fresh strawberries year round wonderfully delicious !
1,"Absolutely delicious food, melt-in-your mouth lyonnaise potatoes and crepelike pancakes.  It's tiny, cheek-by-jowl and often a long line on the weekends, but worth the wait and the cash-only inconvenience.\n\nI can't speak to anything but the breakfast food since I've never been able to get past it!\n\nMy husband and I who lived within walking distance (or waddling distance, when leaving to go home) would normally split a hotcake special with the ham and cheese omelet.  That way we each could get eggs, meat, pancake, and potato cravings fulfilled.  When I went without him, I would either get the breakfast special or the corned beef hash with a side of the hotcake, regular.  My favorite hotcake flavor was the banana and chocolate chip, but occasionally we would get the strawberry or blueberry - don't be afraid by the sour cream ingredient.  It tastes AMAZING, and not too rich. (any richer, with the buttery hotcakes it would be over the top and make it more like dessert than breakfast).\n\nTheir hot cocoa is probably from the package, but made decadent by the generous dollop of whipped cream that floats majestically on top.\n\nI once sat next to Franco Harris at the next table.  If he and Obama eat their hearts out here, you'll do fine.  Come try it already!"
1,"I'm no crepe connoisseur, but I did try quite a few places. I waited Yelping this place until I got a chance to try San Francisco's well-known crepe place. Whereas the SF place wins on their ambiance category, this Pittsburgh gem has a way better quality crepe. The taste here is by far more superior than any other places.  Be prepared to wait in line for half an hour+ on a weekend, but I can assure you that your patience will be well rewarded with a great plate of crepe - regardless of what kind you order!\n\nP.S. - BRING CASH. They do not accept credit cards."
1,"The best place for breakfast in Shadyside, especially if you don't feel like being drowned in food at Pamela's. There might be a wait, and don't try to go with more than two others (really, make it a date), but it's so clean and nice and relaxing. The crepes are excellent, I always get the breakfast crepe (sausage and egg) with their soytang sauce, but the dessert crepes (chocolate and orange! banana!) are also delicious. The little salad of greens and orange slices that comes with the savory crepes is a great addition. Go here when you're feeling cosmopolitan."
1,Love Crepes Parisiennes
1,"The breakfast crepe with b\u00e9chamel sauce is the best crepe on the planet! I have made many a trip to Pittsburgh under the guise of visiting my boyfriend.  Little did he know that I was really taking the 4.5 hour flight from San Francisco to have three or four of the best crepes ever created. \n\nAs I said before, the Breakfast Crepe is the best. It has egg, cheese, breakfast sausage and your choice of one of a few different sauces (the b\u00e9chamel is the best). The BF likes his crepes on the sweeter side, so he enjoys the nutella and banana. The savor crepes are served with a light salad with mandarins oranges and a citrus vinaigrette while the sweet crepes have whipped cream.  \n\nSeriously, this place is amazing. If you live in the Pittsburgh, or are visiting you are doing yourself a disservice by not treating yourself to this absolutely fabulous, terrific, superb, and wonderful restaurant. No joke...now that the BF has graduated and no longer lives in Pittsburgh, I have thought about flying over just to eat at Crepes Parisiennes."
1,"Amazing crepes!\n\nMy wife and I love this place.  We often stop by and try different crepes, my favorite has to be the Russian blintz and her's is the Nutella and banana.  I highly recommend getting a Cafe Au-Lait with your crepe.  \n\nNo complaints about this cozy little creperie."
1,"Boom! I love this place and I'm a 6'3\"" man with an appetite! Every time people want to go I think great crepes and Ill be hungry right after I eat but damn I am wrong with this place.   Breakfast crepe is my choice but they all look amazing. This place fills up fast so get in line order and grab a table. EAT!"
1,"Really delicious crepes! I come here all the time and I love it.  The woman behind the counter always remembers my usual order.\n\nThings to know before going: Cash only, order before sitting, and come during odd hours if you can.  It's a very busy establishment in a small location, but I normally go for late lunch on weekdays and have no problem at all getting a table right away or my food coming out quickly. I avoid Saturday mornings here."
1,"Perhaps it is due to my experiences in dtown Balto that I may have a skewed opinion, but anyone who tries to say that this location has shady patrons is woefully incorrect.  As of today, I have gone to this location throughout every part of the day.  Today, sunday morning, I walked into the fast food joint while half the restaurant was blocked off for prospective vibrant wendy's employees training.\n\ntheir overplayed commercial promoting their breakfast, specifically their \""fresh cracked eggs cooked on a griddle\"" thing, finally inspired me to wake up before noon for the first time in a while to head to wendy's for breakfast.  I got the artisan egg sandwich with sausage combo (which includes their roasted potato slices and a drink (OJ costs 80 cents extra)).  I thought that the roasted potato slices would turn out too gourmet, which i was NOT looking for.  But praise whatever you'd like me to praise, they did use a good amount of starch to give it the outside crunch reminiscent of a french fry or a tator tot.  thumbs up to that.  unfortunately, i may have come too late to get the fresh batch of sausage patties, but mine came out a bit dry.\n\nThen why 5 stars? the 99 cent junior bacon cheeseburger.  my goodness, it could be the best 99 cent fast food item of all time.  i've ordered as many as 6 at once before, and no more than 1 was made with any type of cheese translational misregistration relative to the sausage patty substrate (did i just reveal my identity as a loser? i hope not). in layman's terms, every little cheeseburger came out constructed perfectly, with one slice of fresh tomato, crisp green lettuce, and most importantly, their bacon.\n\noverall, i'm partially thankful to be in pittsburgh because of how near i live to this wendy's, and because pittsburgh is one of only around four metropolitan areas where wendy's currently offers breakfast. although nothing would ever match up to in n out, this is my go-to place to satiate my cravings i get as a socal fast-food junkie."
1,"This is my favorite place in the area, and I would eat here everyday if I could. Their vegan options are extensive and amazingly delicious. The won-ton soup is vegan friendly too, at least that's what the server told me. Portion sizes are generous, the soy protein is to die for and the price is right. This place is a little piece of heaven for vegetarians and vegans, but omnis won't know the difference.\n\nI've visited this location a handful of times, and each experience has been nothing but pleasant. I have tried the fried mushrooms, the sesame soy protein, the orange soy protein, the sweet & sour soy protein, the wheat gluten veggie mix, the general tso soy protein and the hot and sour soup. \n\nMy favorite is the sesame soy protein, but I plan to try all of the soy protein dishes at some point. The wheat gluten is tasty, but it's not the best I've ever had. I prefer the meaty and solid texture of the soy protein over tofu and wheat gluten. \n\nThe spicy dishes are never spicy. You can always ask for extra chile paste like I do though. It's weird that they aren't spicy enough, but that could be because this area isn't as likely to have a preference for the spicy foods. \n\nMy last visit here on April 1st was definitely the most memorable. The sweetest young male was our server. He forgot sesame on our sesame soy protein, and he apologized profusely and fixed it. He kept bringing us refills, especially on my diet coke. Restaurants can be a little stingy with soda refills, but he was generous. He also gave us free rice refills, and since we all love rice, we were immensely grateful. I can't say enough good things about this kid, but I hope the tip we left him conveyed our gratitude.\n\nChina Palace is a win for sure!"
1,"Gary is great with coloring (blonde). It's a cool, laid back little salon."
1,"I am always super weary about going to a new place to get my haircut, as I have had many a bad experience. I have wavy/loosely curly hair that I like to keep cut short, and that combination seems to be lethal for many stylists.\n\nI found a recommendation for Eddy on the internet as a curly hair specialist, and I started going a year ago and am so glad I did! He has never given me a bad cut, and even gave me an awesome 'more experimental' style that I had been waiting to try. I'm moving away from Pittsburgh and I wish I could take Eddy with me!\n\n(In addition, I recommended him to one of my friends, who has super thick hair with some body, and he also gave her an awesome haircut!)"
1,"Best Salon in Pittsburgh! I've been going to Eddy for a few years now and he never fails to make my hair look a thousand times better than it does when walking in the door. I have super thick, curly hair and he makes cutting and styling it look effortless. Super talented stylist who is always great fun to talk to! \n\nEveryone at Salon Cercone are really nice, and the environment is welcoming and casual. It's definitely a great place for the more laid back salon goers."
1,"The staff is super friendly every time I'm in this store. I think I've been there almost every month since there's always something there that I'd love to have and it's right down the street.  Whether it's random cooks tools like a 4\"" wide vegetable peeler (highly recommended), a Microplane grater or splurging on a new Shun knife, Williams-Sonoma always seems to have what I want with people there who know what they're talking about."
1,"Best Chinese food!!! Good delivery service, just love it!"
1,"This place is the bomb.  Great hoagies.  Great pie.  Fair prices.  Cheap delivery.  I have had a LOT of pgh pizza over the years, and this is a solid non-chain joint.  The sandwiches are fantastic. Probably skip the wings or anything fried, to be honest though.  Cheesebread is fantastic.\n\nIt's WELL worth a try folks."
1,"My favorite family Chinese in Pittsburgh!  Best Won ton soup, egg rolls and fried rice (darkened by soy sauce). Lomein , Moo Gu gi pan yummy!  Service is the best part Kitty with her husband Kwan are the owners and Chief cooks and bottle washers.  They do it all and do it well. Cash only but you don't need much prices are very cheap. Freshly made everything (except the classic fortune cookie in the plastic wrapper and wouldn't have it any other way!). Great Oolong tea with every meal!"
1,"As far as bar food goes, this is as good as it gets. They have your normal selection of bar delicacies, but they never cease to satisfy. I can't say much for all of the food though, because every time I go (and that is often) i get an order of killer fries and 24 zestique wings. They are both an amazing combination, and Castle Tavern's wings are by far the best in Castle Shannon. I would highly recommend this place if you like bar food. And their dining room is seperate from their bar so it is smoke free and quiet. Really a quaint little place. Excellent!"
1,Best Italian hoagies you can get
1,"Best Italian hoagie anywhere in the known universe. I have been eating these sandwiches for the better part of my life (I'm 45) and I still can't wait for the next one. It's the way they are toasted and the cheese caramelizes--and the dressing is just perfect. Honest to god, I live in CO and this is always one of the reasons I return to visit the town I grew up in. Just get an Italian hoagie here and quit trying to --you can forget the meatball sub guy. Pizza is quite good, too. But get the hoagie."
1,Awesome place for a working guy to get boots and work clothes esp Carhart stuff ....I have gotten a few pairs of boots here and also got a pair of boots resoled here and it was worth every penny
1,"I was on vacation in Pittsburgh and had a muffler problem. Penn Automotive took a look, told me what I needed, but was unable to fix it that day due to scheduled customers. They also told me it was safe to drive, just loud and annoying. They didn't charge anything. I told them I couldn't give them repeat business since I was from out of town, but would surely give them a good review. If I did live in in the area I would be a regular customer. Thanks again"
1,Fast friendly service and good sandwiches. This is a neighborhood staple that deserves your business.
1,Amazing food. You can stuff your face to the point you hate yourself for $10.00. The shoe string fries are amazing and the subs are made fresh right in front you! I love the casual and down to earth environment. One of my favorite places to eat in the entire city!  The cash only policy isn't ideal and the .50 cent refills I don't agree with but an ATM isn't far if need be! My advice? Eat here! It's delicious.
1,"This has always been my favorite Chinese Restaurant in the Pgh area. Food is consistently very good - General Tso's is tender, not the shoe leather I sometimes get at other places. Steamed dumplings, wonton soup, lo-mein, all terrific."
1,"Truly, the kindest, most gentle vets I have ever met! We recently moved to Pittsburgh, and one of my cats was dealing with an ongoing sickness. We went to VCA Fox Chapel, and I was pleasantly surprised by how kind, caring, and gentle the doctors were. We worked with Dr. Miggins and Dr. Resek. In the end, we ended up having to put our cat to sleep. Even then, Dr. Resek was amazingly patient and kind, and gave us the time and space we needed. Yes, they are expensive. But you are getting great care and more than that, you can rest assured that they truly have your pets' best interest in mind."
1,I took a high end designer purse to be fixed here! It turned out better tan expected! The fixed the strap without any hint of repair! They do a great job on shoes! Great place to do business!
1,Best place in da 'burgh for the frequent traveler!
1,"Bumping up my stars because I have recently found out that they use a soy sauce in their sauces that is gluten free! Feast away, my fellow gluten intolerants and celiacs!"
1,This is my first Thai food restaurant I have eaten at in Pittsburgh and I love it! The Tom kha soup with vegetables is delicious and so is the butternut squash curry. The mango sticky rice is the best dessert!!
1,"I have been a customer at this music store not only for gear since I started playing drums, but also for 5 years of drum lessons. They have great staff who are all very knowledgeable about the gear they sell and I have yet to find better prices in any other music store. They treat customers like friends but they don't try to \""sell\"" you things the way the big corporate stores do. If you need any kind of music gear, but it at N' Stuff Music."
1,By far the best cigar/ pipe selection  with a lounge in the Pittsburgh area!  Great employees and very knowledgeable as well ! A must to come by too!
1,I love the Radisson!!!
1,My boyfriend enjoys brewing his own beer and the guys here are wonderful. They always have the supplies and if they don't they can recommend places to get them! Everyone is always very nice and knowledgeable!
1,"Cheap bowling, clean, serves food, & has pool tables. What else could you ask for in a bowling alley?"
1,"Living in the burbs and spending most of my time in the city, I always look and seek out some natural green space now and then.  Running on the greenways are great, but it is rare to have a good amount of land dedicated to nature and activities.  Latta Plantation Park is not only home to the Carolina Raptor Center, but also has a number of horse trails (you can use for running and hiking as well) and access to Mountain Island Lake for water activities.\n\nI came here for an open water swimming event (NOTE:  there is no swimming in the lake unless it is a sanctioned event).  It was strange getting into the water right were a big \""NO SWIMMING\"" warning sign was posted.  The no swimming rule is probably due to the way the lake was formed and Duke Energy's involvement, but the rules are the rules.  There are plenty of houses that dot the perimeter with docks and watercraft.\n\nThe park facilities are well kept and there is a good sense of trying not to interfere too much with nature."
1,This place is great for the whole family. Admission was $8.00 because they were having a special holiday program. The grounds were just like it was back in the 1800's. The houses and cabins are in excellent shape. The gift shop was nice and the civil reenactment was nice to watch. This place is perfect for a great history lesson.
1,"This is a great way to spend a few hours (or 45 minutes, in my case. Strong am I with the force ;) with friends or a significant other. \n\nI've been to the Amazing Maize Maze a few times and gotta say that it is really fun! Plus I am a sucker for clever puns.\n\nCome prepared for the weather, as it takes some people 2-3 hours to get out of the maze. A light snack may not be that bad either. Water is provided throughout. \n\nSurprisingly, there is more to the maze than just the maze. Of course your goal is to get out, but also to find 12 stations containing pieces of a map AND also reading \""kernels of knowledge\"" (get it) listed on boards throughout the maze, which help you solve a cross-word puzzle. This flexibility allows many ways to enjoy the maze and to make it more challenging. Or you can pound through and just try to find the exit.\n\nThere are helpers in the maze to give hints, and also at the bridge and tower. You also get a tall flag to use for help if need be, but you can opt out.   \n\nTotally do it!"
1,"*disclaimer up front*\nI am a transport volunteer for the injured raptors coming into this facility. Most of my \""deliveries\"" get euthanized because of the severity of their injuries... and I see this place as the single best way to educate John Q. Public about why these birds die needlessly every day. \nBefore I became a transporter, I visited here at the urging of friends... and, friend, I was hooked. This is one of the best, intelligent displays/educational interactions of birds of prey I have ever seen. I bring my friends and family here whenever they visit because it is that cool, and that important. I even have a friend who also became a volunteer here after visiting."
1,"I love zoos and animals, so I was looking forward to checking out the Raptor Center. We had my niece and nephew last weekend (ages 6 and 3) so we decided to take them there to check out the birds.\n\nI enjoyed the center and felt the price was right for the amount of exhibits and time it takes to get around ($10 adults, free kids under 4). The Raptor Center is a sanctuary for birds who would not make it in the wild, and they go to schools to educate young kids about raptors, so I didn't exactly feel bad paying since I knew it was going to a good cause. They had several different kinds of owls, eagles, hawks, vultures and other predatory birds. Most of the habitats seemed to be a decent size for the animal inside, and the birds themselves seemed relatively comfortable. There was also a little playground based on Harry Potter for the kids to play in, and they liked that. The staff there were very friendly and informative, and several who were transporting a bird from one area to the next were more than happy to take a few seconds to tell us a little about the bird and let the kids get a good look at it.\n\nMy nephew really enjoyed looking at all the birds, and he even knew a little on his own since the center had brought some birds over to his school. My three year old niece didn't care for it as much and was more interested picking rocks and thistles out of the dirt then looking at birds in cages. I was really glad that she was free and we didn't have to pay for her!\n\nOverall, it's a really clean, friendly, and educational experience. Check out some cool looking birds while walking the trails and learn about these beautiful raptors. Great for kids and adults."
1,"I was in Charlotte visiting family over Spring Break when my engine started misfiring.  It was Good Friday afternoon and I was planning to drive back to Chicago the following day. All the auto shops were going to be closed for the holiday weekend, so I knew I had to get it taken care of that day.  I called and spoke to Todd, who told me it might be a bigger job than they had time for, but told me to bring it right over and he'd see what he could do. \nI'm SO glad I brought it there.  Three men worked together to quickly diagnose the problem, go get the part I needed, WASHED the car while they were waiting for the part (just to be nice!!) and solved my problem in about an hour.  The price they charged me was much less than I expected, and I can honestly say it was the BEST car repair experience I have ever had.\nPlease take your car to these guys with confidence.  There's just no way you'll regret it."
1,I came to Tullock because my wife and i are big on Yelp. I recently purchased a vehicle after i lost my other car in a recent auto accident. The car i purchased had numerous issues and financially i was in a bind. I came hoping that I'd find a mechanic that was honest and that wouldn't take advantage of me. All i can say is Mr. Tullock went above and beyond his duties to help me. I can't even begin to say how thankful i am for his service! Mr. Tullock is a man of integrity and character! I seldom have ever came across people like him. Not only did i find a mechanic i made a friend! There's no one else I'd even trust my car with! All i can say is my family and i thank him from the bottoms of our hearts! We are in your debt sir! Tullock Automotive is 2nd to none! Hands down best shop in Matthews maybe even in all of North Carolina!
1,"We moved to Matthews in 1987 and bought a new house. The heating and air conditioning units had been installed by Custom Comfort. Whenever we have needed repairs or replacements we have used them. They are prompt, their prices are fair and I trust them. They won't try to sell you a replacement unit if your current equipment can be repaired. After 25 years of great service I wouldn't think of calling anyone else."
1,"We appreciate so very much the honesty, integrity, and prompt and efficient service provided by Custom Comfort Heating & Air of Matthews, NC.  Custom Comfort has serviced our home for over ten years.  This company provides wonderful service to their customers.  The company operates with ethics and integrity.  You can trust this company and be assured of their best with every service call!"
1,Great food! awesome Margaritas!
1,"Great BBQ plate, amazing slaw on burger. So glad I found this place right near my house."
1,"I arrived late-ish, tired from a grueling trip and emotionally bruised from an encounter with a rental car company, and immediately I was in good hands. Kind and friendly front desk people took care of me, going the extra mile. Beautiful lobby, excellent room (impeccably clean), great wings at the bar (open late!), patient servers, and just an overall feeling of comfort and wellbeing.  Lovely bed, hot shower, in-room coffee pot, freshly renovated...go stay there. I would. \n\nHighly recommend. Only faint issue:  would have loved free wi-fi. Not a deal-breaker, though. I like Starwood Hotels, of which this is one."
1,"I love these wings!!!\n\nThere are so many flavors here....and I've enjoyed a lot of them...like, Hot, Barbecue, Cajun, Lemon Pepper and Spicy Garlic Parmesan and I have not been disappointed yet! \n\nEach wing is juicy and full of flavor, they are always hot and made to order ..SOOOO amazing! \n\nYes...they have more than just wings....like pizza, subs and fries...but I've only had the wings AND trust me YOU are going to want to try these wings...again and again!!!\n\nIn my opinion, these are the best wings in town!"
1,"I reviewed TLC back in Feb., and you can read that one for yourself. I complained about the attitude and attention given the customers which was so bad I didn't want to go back. If I can speak plainly about their faults, then when they do good, I feel it should be noted as well. I've been several times now here in Sep. and Oct., and the teenagers are gone. There's an adult running the kitchen now, and a mature, helpful person on the register, and I'd like to think my earlier review had something to do with making these changes. The wings are still the best around, and now its a treat to go in and pick up some delicious wings (which are done when promised), and promptly be served, waited on, and out the door in a hurry. I don't try many flavors because the terriaki is just the BOSS, but my wife likes the honey BBQ, and I'm sure the rest are equally good. The problems seem to be worked out on the service, and their wings were always the best, so I can recommend that you even go out of your way to try the wings at TLC, and feel confident in saying you won't be disappointed!!"
1,"I dislike when people give low reviews because of uncontrollable factors like other loud guests and too many people.  If it's a good place, you are gonna get both.  And it's a German restaurant for goodness sake.  Ever hear of Octoberfest?  It's not a quiet outing from what I've heard.\n\nThe food here is excellent.  From the sausages, to the breads, to the red cabbage, etc.  I have yet to really have a meal I didn't like.  I usually take a good look at the special, since it's usually pretty reasonably priced, and a good mix as well.  I admit the no more free pretzel rolls sucks.  But you know what else sucks?  The economy.  \n\nThe selection of beer and wine is pretty good as well.  Usually we go with a big group, and the next time I go, I will make an effort to keep my voice down.  LOL.\n\nIf you're looking for good German food in Charlotte, hit it up!"
1,"Tonight was my first time here, and I think I'm in love. The beer selection is fantastic (you had me at Weihenstepher), the service was great, and the food was really, really good. I ordered the Wurst Platte, which, as it's name suggests, is a plate of sausages--three different kinds, to be exact, with a side of kraut and home fries. There was also a perfect dribbling of jaeger sauza to go with it. I've always like kraut, but not loved it. This stuff, I loved. It actually had a slightly sweet flavor to counteract the normal tang of kraut. My wife had a pork schnitzel that was flayed and stuffed with black forest ham and cheese. Nothing better than stuffing pork with pork, my friends. That was served with a side of spaetzle and broccoli that was actually fresh. \n\nThe old timer walking around playing the accordian was a nice touch and got everyone going. There were a lot of large parties, but we were seated quickly and also served quickly. The location is a little out of the way for a Charlottean, but well worth the trip if you find yourself south of town."
1,"Great restaurant. Has a mug club that is worthwhile if you go here a lot. Their food is great, especially the pretzel rolls you get.  The beer selection is vast.\n\nOktoberfest is a great time as well. A polka band plays while you eat and enjoy authentic German food."
1,"Having been in Charlotte only a year, I'd despaired of finding good German cuisine in the QC.  Turns out you have to go to Pineville.  Also turns out it's well worth the drive.\n\nThe Waldhorn is a little kitschy, but appropriately so.  Their tap selection is well-chosen and good.  The rolls are pretzel-y and fantastic.  The sauerkraut is sauer enough, though they do the sweet caraway-seed version.  The wurst is the best in Charlotte.  (Please don't kill me.)\n\nWe started with the wurst plate, served with mustard, sauerkraut and rolls.  There was plenty, and I should've stopped there, but I hadn't had good German food in a while, and was in a celebratory mood.\n\nI had the jagerschnitzel.  It was made entirely of food.  Pork was thin, crispy and delicious.  Red cabbage was firm and sweet.  Sp\u00e4tzle needed salt, but it usually does.  Heated up well the next day, also--there was a lot of it.\n\nShe had the venison.  Sweet lord.  That is all.\n\nAn older gentleman in liederhosen and wielding an accordion played throughout the place, but never so loud as to be distracting.  I like the accordion though, so your mileage may vary.\n\nIt is a little pricier than I would've liked, but I don't think that is going to stop me from going back.  Regularly."
1,"Let me start by saying this. If it's lunch...\n\nORDER A PRETZEL ROLL...or maybe 3! (They're free with dinner, or at lunch they're $1.) Crunchy exterior (but not hard) sprinkled with sea salt and served with pats of butter. \n\nCan I admit, I wish I hadn't offered my husband half of mine, so I could have eaten the whole thing?  Silly Dion. \n\nBut besides that, Waldenhorn's food is authentic German, set in a comfortable, homey setting with friendly servers.  Lots of beers on tap, served by the liter and half liter. \n\nLunch is usually served until 3pm, but on Saturdays it's 4pm.  I had the special of the day, the Rindsrouladen, which is braised beef rolled with cabbage, onions, pickle and bacon.  It was served with spatzel and green beans.  \n\nI ate the entire thing!  The meat is so tender, the spatzel nice and buttery (their spatzel is more like long thin noodles, not little pellet shapes BTW) and even the green beans were nice and crisp and garlicky.  No mushy beans here! \n\nMy husband got the weinershnitzel, and it was pounded perfectly thin and uniform, crisp on the outside and tender and moist on the inside.  The fries are the thin, super crispy kind (Think BK...but better. Strange comparison, I know.) and more of those yummy crisp green beans. He too ate it all!\n\nOur server was very good at explaining each menu item to us, and didn't steer us wrong with her recommendations. She even came by to ask if we wanted more gravy...which we did, and could have sopped up 5 pretzel rolls with the stuff! \n\nPrices were reasonable.  Sandwiches about $7-$9 and the lunch entrees about $10 to $11. \n\nCan't wait to go back and try dinner (Complete with accordion player!?) or their brunch buffet. Oktoberfest is coming up too, which includes live music and festivities."
1,"THIS REVIEW IS FOR THEIR BRUNCH. IF IT IS SUNDAY BEFORE 230PM AND YOU ARE READING THIS - STOP. GO TO THE WALHORN. THEN RETURN TO SAID YELP REVIEW AND THANK ME. THIS IS NOT A JOKE. THIS IS VERY REAL.\n\nSometimes there are things in life that you just can't express in words full how much such and such means to you. Or how much you hate it. Or love it. This is ALMOST one of those cases, but for you fine people I will spit some lyrical truth about this epic brunch.\n\nBest roast beef in the land\nSliced by hand,\nOn your Command,\nDelish.\n\nBreakfast foods ye seek,\nMight as well get 2 plates,\nFrench toast and hashbrowns peak,\nUnder all that bacon.\n\nSausages are varied,\nMustard with them - heaven.\nSauerbraten, sauerkraut, spaitzel\nOh look, schnitzel - I'll have 7\n\nI love you Waldhorn Brunch.\nI want to spend my life with you.\nThis isn't a poem.\nBRB going for another trip (and don't skip dessert!)"
1,"OMG! Why or why have I never been here before now. This place is awesome, in so many ways. First the atmosphere was perfect. A very casual feel. There's a bar that you can walk up to sit down order a great pint of beer. Second the waitstaff is extremely knowledgeable. Third the food all my God is so good.  The portion sizes are great. We will be going back definitely."
1,"Excellent service and the most delicious food! The waitstaff is very attentive and friendly and the manager Brian is awesome. My husband compares the kartoffelpuffer to the potato pancakes that his mom or grandmother would make - very authentic. They have a great selection of German beers and wines. The sauerbraten and gegrillter lachs are two of my favorite entrees. I also highly recommend the rindsrouladen and the schnitzel. The portion sizes are very generous; I always had leftovers to take home. The apfelstrudel is a must for dessert. While living in the Charlotte area, we ate here at least once every week or two. Hands down best and most authentic German restaurant I have ever eaten at."
1,"One of our favorite restaurants!  Been there many times for Sunday brunch, beer club Tuesdays and special occasions.  Most recently we stopped by for the Charlotte restaurant week special.  This is a really good deal as they have many more selections than any other restaurant and offer 4 courses instead of 3.  Everything is great but I highly recommend trying the Ungarische Gulaschsuppe, like the best beef stew ever.  The brunch is also something everyone should experience.  The omelets are amazing and the beef tenderloin carving station just takes it over the top.  There is a huge selection of items with lots of German items to choose from."
1,"Wunderbar! Authentic! Eleven German draft beers. The server( Stefanie) was from Dresden and did a great job. Sauerbraten, spatzle, and rot kohl were great!"
1,"Everytime I'm in the area I stop here.  Great selection of German Beers.  Staff could not be more welcoming and friendly.  Schnitzel, red cabbage, potato pancakes are excellent.  If you are not filled by the end of the meal the black forest cake is a can't miss."
1,"You don't see German restaurants very often and I'm glad I ran into this one for lunch. To begin, great atmosphere and stellar service. And because it's a German spot, I had to order the Wiener Schnitzel. I'm glad I did because it was fantastic. It's been a while since I've had breaded veal, but to say I was satisfied would be an understatement."
1,"We were in Charlotte visiting Carowinds and we were tired when we checked into our hotel. Plan A was to find a mid-level chain and bring take-out back to our room, but then I spotted Waldhorn's on the list. The ratings and reviews looked way too good to be true, but I have a soft spot for German food and the prices looked downright reasonable. So we rallied and had one of the best dining experiences of our lives.\n\nThe service was friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. Great recommendations on beer and appetizer.\n\nWith a Warsteiner Dunkel for him and a Spaten Oktoberfest for me, we started with a Gebackener Ziegenk\u00e4se. The pastry was light and perfectly crisped. The goat cheese, spinach & sun-dried tomato filling was surprisingly light, even after dredging it through the brown gravy and sour cream.\n\nFor our entree, my other half ordered the Hausgemachte Maultaschen \""geschmelzt\"", pasta filled with meat and spinach, lightly dressed with sauteed onions and beef broth. I ordered Wienerschnitzel, but I wasn't enthused about french fries and the veg of the day (broccoli) being served with it, so the server cheerfully and enthusiastically switched them for spaetzle and red cabbage. \n\nOur meals were perfect. Every single mouthful was perfect. The spaetzle was really light and was sincerely the best I've ever had. The red cabbage was beautifully prepared. The wienerschnitzel melted in my mouth. His meal was a little lighter than mine, but still filling and so very delicious.\n\nAnd reasonable! Two beers, appetizer, and two entrees? $50 before the tip. \n\nNow I'm mad because it's so far away."
1,Not our first visit and not our last. Great quality German food and beers. Spatzle red cabbage and schnitzels galore. I like the wurst platte and the wife loves Jagerschnitzel. Portions are not quite big enough to split unless you load up on soups and the fabulous pretzel bread.
1,Great food and service. Very happy with my visit.
1,Definitely not stingy on the meat! The hot corned beef and the baked potatoes are delicious .
1,"This is the second review I have done for this store and for this sales associate, Samantha.  I purchased my dress the first of the month and after looking at other headpieces on line decided I wanted to swap out what I had gotten. I went in today , not sure what to expect but Samantha was there and was just as gracious and courteous as during my initial purchase. I explained my situation and she immediately spent time with me finding  veil more to my liking. The one I picked was slightly less than the original and she was just  concerned for my happiness with the veil. Again, If you are looking for a wedding dress, request Samantha, you will not be disappointed. This review was not solicited in any way from the store or from Samantha."
1,Good food and good service. Will definitely go back.
1,"I've been to this restaurant twice and the food is amazing. Someone wrote here that the food tastes like it's either frozen or straight out of a can. I've had frozen italian and canned italian. The first thing you notice when eating at Buca is how FRESH the food tastes. Even the herbs in it seem quite fresh and complimentary.  someone also wrote that the atmosphere was loud and that they sang birthday songs a lot. Well to get around that my advice is to eat at home. This an italian restaurant. Nothing should be quiet about it! Enjoy the food, enjoy the cuture and go home. Some people will complain about ANYTHING."
1,"After a good body massage me and my other 2 friends went to this place , the whole wall is decorated with variety of pictures :) , this place was so different , you can walk inside kitchen , there is even a booth near kitchen :) \nThis restaurant has some art on the other side of the rooms , I will go next time to see them all :) \nWe ordered cheese motzerila n garlic break , it was hot crunchy , yummy :) we ordered chicken  Parmesan family size for 3 of us and packed one for our other friend , it yummy de best I ever had , I would personally  prefer this over Olive Garden and magiannos , chicken was crispy , soft and juicy , tomato sauce was so fresh and i think they made from scratch , waitress was very good , she suggested me some cream soda , which was awesome , tables are quite close , which made me feel like family restaurant , I would go here again and again :)"
1,"GREAT steaks, prepared just the way it was ordered. Highly recommend the Portabello mushroom steak. Fast, friendly service."
1,Being apart of  the Darden company I knew what to expect which was great service. My family received just that. Ashley was our server and she was awesome. Our food was nice and hot and was on time. Thank you Longhorn family!!!
1,"Omgoodness! Went with the other reviews and tried Genaro's. This was some of the best food ever and we eat out a lot, everywhere and all cuisines. The rotisserie chicken held up to the reviews as the BEST we've  ever had! The sauces were crazy fantastic too. From the Aguadito soup to the plantains to the cilantro rice to the most awesome Tres Leches. Wow. If you're in the area or anywhere  near Pineville, NC definitely recommend. Service and recommendations  from Luis were greatly appreciated  as well. 5 stars. We are bookmarking  this one and are so happy it's only 1/2 hour away:-)"
1,"I came here for the first time and was so happy they could customize my bagel to be healthy by making it skinny (cutting a chunk out of the middle making it thinner) and using egg whites.  It was warm, fresh and tasty.\n\nNext I thought I would try one of their Green Mountain coffees - the Island Coconut flavor.  I know what your thinking but stop right there .... give it a whirl.  Wow it is good!  I got so excited about it I craved it for a whole week.\n\nIts such a nice change to a greasy fried breakfast.  I'm glad I went and I will be back!"
1,"Admittedly, the grump factor is high in some of my Yelp reviews.  In my defense, that's because my priority when reading others' reviews is to take note of the bad places and avoid them and I try to return the favor.\n\nThat said, I'm happy to click five stars for this location and would give them a sixth if I could.  Unfailingly helpful, polite, friendly and efficient, the crew lineup at this store has been remarkably stable - it makes one confident of getting the same excellent product and service regardless of the day of the week and despite the brutal early morning hours including weekends.  They are never shorthanded.\n\nThe bagels themselves are unmatched in the local market and in the Bruegger's chain overall.  The whole 'thank you baker' routine is a bit contrived but this one deserves the gratitude from staff and customers alike.\n\nI'm not crazy about have to stand in a queue to get a quick bag of bagels and a to-go coffee waiting for others to place intricate eat-in orders but that's generally a problem only on the weekends.\n\nThis location has the self-serve coffee bar which also saves time and headaches for all.\n\nI'm roughly equidistant from a few Bruegger's locations.  I occasionally visit other locations and am consistently disappointed, especially in the Park Road store (see other review). I'm a slow learner, I suppose, but grateful that one location does it right."
1,"I recently moved to Charlotte and I was looking for a nail salon to get a mani and pedi. I'm so happy I stopped at Lefi. I loved, loved the manicure and pedicure they gave me. They took their time and gave me the longest and best massages. The also add paraffin to their pedicure for no extra charge. I will definitely recommend this place, not only they give great service but they are super friendly."
1,"First time visiting this mall and it definitely has a good spread of shopping and food. We weren't on a mission to purchase anything so we were just walking around but it was clean, bright and buzzing with activity."
1,I love this place because the pasta is always very very very hot.
1,"Everything pasta ! BuonAppetito ! So our first impression was we would be here awhile since parking was full. Surprisingly enough we were seated in less than 10 minutes. Our sever was prompt and informative and our first course arrived on our table less than 8 minutes from the time we ordered it! \nThe salad had only one complaint and it seems to be a consistent issue with this restaurant - one that really doesn't make sense to me - olives ! There are two olives in the large bowl of salad ... If you want more than two olives, you have to ask for them - which is strange since their very name boasts of them ! Have found this to be the case each to time I've eaten here. \nSpaghetti & meat sauce was my meal and it\n was yummy.  Hubs had seafood Alfredo . He said he wouldn't recommend it again but it was just okay. \n\nTiramsu was delicious and the coffee was fresh and piping hot !\nNo complaints other than the olive shortage ..."
1,Wow! The tenderloin medallions were out of this world! Full if flavor and choice of topping. The service was fantastic as well. I have no complaints here.
1,"I came here initially seeking Sriracha, but unfortunately, this location did not carry it. The very handsome sales associate (near the computer stuff on 8/23) with the moist blue eyes and sandy hair was incredibly helpful to my friend and me. He searched other stores for Sriracha and skillfully wrote directions for us. I've never received directions as precise as those he gave us. This sales associate was exceptional and smelled really good. I highly recommend this location for its staff (but don't go here for Sriracha)."
1,"While I normally don't review auto repair places, I felt compelled to quickly review Carolina Tire. While they aren't the cheapest, they are by far the most professional, efficient and reliable auto repair business I've encountered during my time in Charlotte.\n\nSome key points:\n1. They charge a fair price and don't nickel and dime you on the \""extra's\"" - what they quote is what they charge. Also some nice value-adds like free roadside assistance with oil changes.\n2. They are professional - you are dealing with folks who view this as their career and honor their work.\n3. Consistency - it's very underrated! When I need to get my oil changed or car fixed, I want the same experience and no surprises. Carolina Tire delivers on that promise.\n4. They have a good waiting area, complete with a children's play area, big screen TV and free wifi.\n\nOnly downside is that their location is not handy for walking to the mall or restaurants - if you need a ride they will take you to Lynx, but the location doesn't have a lot of stuff immediately next door.\n\nOverall I'm a big fan!"
1,"I have been servicing my car here for a year, and I have only had good experiences here.\n\n1. The staff works hard to make sure you are getting the best prices on parts and they charge reasonable rates for labor.\n2. They stand by their warranty.  I had my timing belt changed, and after a couple of months i thought it was idling loud.  They took care of the problem with no additional charges.\n3. They don't nickel and dime you.  At the Subaru dealership and Woodies, they charge me $75 - $90 just to look at the car.  At tread quarters I asked for a couple of lights to be replaced on top of getting my breaks replaced, and they took care of it for no additional charge.\n4. They stand by their quote, and charge you for the exact time worked, even if it comes in under the quote.  At woodies they charged me the full price of the quote, even though they only worked on the car for half the time of the original quote."
1,"I was a bit skeptical about boarding my dog since I take him wherever I go but I heard rave reviews this place. That being said, I was a tad nervous when taking my dog there last summer. The staff was extremely friendly and understanding about my apprehension about leaving my dog and I thank them for that. When I was away, they emailed me a picture of my dog so I could see he was doing well (plus you can go online and see them on their webcam during play time) They also offer additional packages with more play time, ice cream doggie treats, bed time stories (don't laugh, thats just cute) and more. My dog was so happy when I went to pick up, I think he was even smiling! I think their prices are pretty reasonable for overnight stay compared to some other joints in the area and have taken him there a few times since.  \n\n Best Friends also offers your pets first night free which is pretty sweet seeing that I have nothing against saving $$$$ here and there and they provide you with a report card when you pick them up--again--cute!! Even though I dont like near there anymore, I would definitely go there again and can't recommend them enough."
1,"Best friends pet care has been the only place I know my golden retriever will receive the same care and love that I give to him. My coop has been coming here for four years and he acts like every day is his first, he comes in with such excitement and the ladies at the desk know him by name and they get down to his level and hug him and give him lots of petting and complements! Coop gets treated like a king here, he enjoys doggie day-camp, his two bedroom suite with comfortable bedding even I would like to sleep on! Also, coop gets his bubble bath and paw-icure even a nice trim just before I am scheduled to pick him up. Coop then greets me with a big hug when I come to pick him up along with a good report card from the staff at the desk. They all tell me how well behaved he was and they look forward to him coming back. Not only is \""best friends\"" coop's best friends but they are mine too because they love him the way I love my dog!!!"
1,"Brought my girlfriends car in this morning to get a NC state inspection. I was greeted by Brian who was extremely friendly and helpful. He got me in and out of there in a half hour and gave me some good advice on my car and what needs to be serviced soon. I would recommend precision auto tune in pineville, NC to anyone who likes good quick service. Ask for Brian! Go Panthers!"
1,"I started going here when I purchased a Living Social for some oil changes, but will now  be a lifetime customer.  Their customer service is amazing and they are incredibly reasonable on price.  Great place."
1,Just left there and my car was inspected quickly and no hidden costs.  The staff was efficient and quick and that's all I can ask.
1,"I have never actually been there in person, but I have caught some of it on live-streaming.  And I know Todd and Tracie and they are two of the most genuine, interesting, intelligent, and kind people I have ever known.  I live in Chicago, so I rarely get to see them, but when I do, the conversations are EPIC and can go late into the night, touching on things you would never even think of with anyone else.  Everyone should have people like them in their lives.  \nAlso, I love coffee.  If you love coffee, you should TOTALLY go check it out.  And if you hate coffee, I am sure they've still got ya covered.  Because that is just the kind of people they are."
1,"Hatoya is awesome!  They have everything, even my favorite kind of  ready to cook pan fry yakisoba noodles - Marusan.  I think it's the best and it's hard to find in Charlotte.\n\nIt's a small shop but they have everything you could need to make your own sushi at home.  They have all kinds of tsukemono, tea, okake, miso, wakame, kombu, nori, candy like Pokki and gummies, pounded rice red bean pasties, Japanese bread, all kinds of pre-packaged treats and snacks...  I could list a hundred things I haven't seen since the last time I was actually in Japan.\n\nThe store is impeccably clean and run by the nicest Japanese people you ever met.  They were very patient with me when I was asking dumb questions like what kind of sauce to use when I try to make my own yaki-onigiri at home.  \n\nIt's down by pineville but the fact that they're a little cheaper than other places around Charlotte means it's worth the drive."
1,"WOW. What a nice hotel for the price.  The breakfast area was great with oatmeal, eggs, fruit, yogurt.  You can even make your own waffle.  Rooms are VERY nice with great beds and furniture.\n\nThey even have sacks you can grab if in a rush with bananas and a breafast bar.\n\nTV in the mirror. TV in the mirror. TV in the mirror. TV in the mirror.\n\nReally cool."
1,"I have been eating at greens since I was a little kid. I still go there with my husband every Saturday that I am in Charlotte. It is a tiny little place that has been there forever but they have the best hotdogs around. The chili is smooth and yummy. They also always make your crinkle fries when you order them, so they are always fresh and hot, never sitting under a heat lamp.  Also, the people that work there are very friendly. We are regulars there and they always welcome us like we are old friends. If you like hotdogs, fries, and drinks with crushed ice, definitely give this place a try next time you are in uptown Charlotte."
1,One of the oldest hotdog / hamburger joints in Charlotte. Burgers and hotdogs are fresh and made to order. Charlotte Classic
1,"Old school Charlotte.  Simple, straight forward , comfort food.  The hot dogs are average.  Their burgers  ANY BURGER-  is great.  I usually get a chili cheese burger.  Their breakfast is very, very good.  For the price, you really cannot beat this place."
1,"This place is great. It's an old building but they really make it work and don't fight their limitations at all.  It's well located, there's a bar in the lobby (watch yourself, that guy pours em stiff), and the staff give a crap.  The only drawback is the parking situation ...and it's a little hard to actually drive to the building itself, given the whole \""crazy series of one-way streets\"" in downtown Charlotte.  But yeah, I thought it was fantastic all around - oh, and the price for it all is great."
1,"If I could give 10 stars I would!  This hotel went above and beyond when my Uncle fell ill and had to be hospitalized while visiting Charlotte.  They used their London Cab to come and pick us up at the hospital even though it was out of their cab range.  They also gave me a discounted rate on another room so I could stay in Charlotte and take care of my Uncle.  Now on to the hotel itself, it is gorgeous!  The rooms are spacious and so quiet.  I didn't hear a peep from any of my neighbors in the two different rooms I stayed in.  The complimentary breakfast is on point!  Look no further if you are looking for a place in Charlotte that will make you feel like you are part of their family."
1,Perfect. Cocktails in the bar. Room service for breakfast. The suite was beautiful. Romantic. NYE already booked. Great location and plenty of things to do without having to get in your auto. We could live at this hotel. 8-) This is not the typical chain hotel....That is a great thing.
1,Great hotel! Came here for the weekend with my boyfriend. It was my first time in charlotte and I loved it. Check out was at 12 and they allowed extended checkout which was helpful. Complementary coke and water in the room was awesome! The room was nice with fluffy pillows. Ac was nice and cold and the shower head had great pressure! (Its the little things that matter)  definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice hotel to stay at.
1,"The hotel was great. Complimentary breakfast, friendly service, clean rooms,complimentary  wi-fi and great location. This hotel was very cozy and it almost felt like home. The front desk staff were very friendly and they were able to get our rooms earlier. Better than any well known hotels."
1,"So...it's been at least two years since I've been to McNinch and I still remember the experience like it was yesterday. And I have to agree with Bill on this one, it's pretty amazing.\n\nHubs and I decided to try this illustrious resto for Valentine's Day in 2008, we went through the whole reservation process, custom menu, custom wine pairings - the whole shebang. We actually followed all their directions to a t and arrive early, enjoyed some champagne while taking a tour of the sweet little home/restaurant on Church St. And then the incredible began...\n\nWe were blown away (for the entire 3+ hours) by the spectacular pairings of food and wine, accompanied by fantastic service. I know we saved our menu for quite some time, but I'm not sure where it ran off to. Every single course was creatively prepared and tons of local ingredients were immersed into the dishes. Our server was also extremely knowledgable in each wine, explaining its heritage and vineyard to us. \n\nSince we choose the wine pairing option, we quite literally had a different (and interesting) glass of wine with every of the seven courses. Good thing we lived in the Fourth Ward at that time. Hey-oo!\n\nMcNinch House is such a special place to experience an amazing meal. It's pricey and well worth every penny: I'm still talking about my meal 2.5 years later. We probably spent about $400 all in, including the wine pairings for each of us, seven courses and tip. An expensive meal for sure, but it's wonderful for a anniversary or milestone celebration."
1,"As a celebration for my birthday and a recent promotion, my wife and I ate here on Friday evening. One of the first reservations of the evening, we were able to be seated in the parlor next to a magnificent Christmas tree. \n\nWe chose the premier menu (Groupon helped) along with the wine pairing option. Pricey to be sure, but the latter took the evening from wonderful to memorable. It is clear from his excellent choices that our wine steward had taken the time to taste the foods we selected and expertly pair our wines. Each one was spot on and enhanced the courses with which they were paired. \n\nFor that special occasion with that special person, McNinch House is one of Charlotte's finest."
1,"Went for a romantic dinner with my wife. Excellent food. Chose the 5 course selection. Delightful service, knowledgeable waiters, amazing food. We decided to pair cocktails with our pre, main and dessert courses. It was a wonderful choice. I highly recommend the duck and salmon. In fact, I recommend everything they have. Will definitely be returning. If you can, take a quick tour of the house, it is beautiful. Although, the classical music playing is somewhat cliche of a 1980s movie scene where a ragamuffin walks in and every turns and looks at them, it is very classy. All in all, please make this restaurant your choice for a celebration; let it be an anniversary or a birthday. If you have any questions, the staff will be more than glad to assist you."
1,"My partner took me to Alexander Michael's last night for dinner.  When he lived in Uptown, he used to frequent the restaurant often, but it was my first time.  You could say I got my cherry popped.  Alexander Michael's is tucked away from the Uptown skyscrapers in the residential section.  You probably wouldn't see it unless you knew it was there.  It looks like it could be just another house on the quiet street.  There are no big signs for it and not a lot of discernable noise from the outside.  \n\nOnce we got inside, though, we saw that it was quite packed.  We were lucky to get seated right away in the crowded room that resembled something of an English or Irish pub.  The lighting was low and the casually dressed crowd was \""older\"" than a lot of Uptown bars, so we felt like we fit in with the 30- and 40-somethings. \n\nWe started with a Woodchuck Cider (not everyone carries ciders!) and it was sweet, bubbly, and refreshing.  We enjoyed that our server wasn't overly attentive, but she was there whenever we needed to order and checked up on us only when necessary.  I tried the blackened catfish and my partner had the honey chicken.  Both were delicious.  Mine (accompanied by spicy black beans) had just the right amount of cajun flavor.  And the portion sizes were just right -- not enough to overfill you, but not enough to leave you hungry when you left.  \n\nIt was definitely an enjoyable experience, and I look forward to returning to this new (to me).  The only disappoint is that we weren't able to see the famous pole that they talked about on the back of the menu.  It's located in the women's restroom and apparently it's caused quite a few bruises.  Funny!"
1,"Just wow. If you ever come to Charlotte, go to the 4th Ward... its one of the most interesting downtown residential neighborhoods I've ever been in. When you go there, make sure you stop in here for some fantastic people watching and great beers. \n\nSeriously, walking here transports you completely away from the hustle and bustle and rowdiness of Tryon."
1,Love this place.  Great food and unique character.  A must if you live in Charlotte.
1,"LOVE everything about this place.  Great atmosphere, great date place, great bar, and great food!  You must try the nachos!  Everything on the menu is good, and they have Warsteiner on tap!"
1,Love this place for its micro beers and spicy crab soup. The london broil looks amazing but i did not try it. Five people at my table ordered and greedily scarfed it down leaving crumbs not even fit for a mouse. Hehe ya that good! Can't wait to waunder in again and i love that they have local meats on there menu.\nOur server was so sweet too.
1,One of my favorite places to eat in Uptown. My go to dishes are the London broil entree and the what it is. Tried out most of the menu and can't say I've had anything bad. The daily specials are usually pretty great as well.
1,"On Thursday, Aug. 18th, I had the pleasure of visiting Alexander Michael's for dinner.  This was probably the fifth or sixth time I have eaten at this local neighborhood gem, and I can assuredly tell you, this Alexander Michael's experience was just as good as the first.\n\nMy date and I walked in pleasantly surprised that despite the warm, quiet, lazy, summer evening outside, Alexander Michael's was cool, dark, and very lively on the inside.  We were directly escorted to a table in the cozy restaurant, just behind the bar.  \n\nMy date ordered the chicken pita with fries (I've taken a picture of it), I ordered the craw fish bake (see pic).  The bake was a cross between a shrimp pasta and a seafood casserole.  It was perfectly gooey and cheesy - but not heartstoppingly so.  As for my date's pita; she loved it.  I had a few bites and can attest to its legitimacy.  Both OUR MEALS WERE EXCELLENT!!  \n\nI am truly of fan of this elegant and intimate Charlotte jewel. To me, Alexander Michael's is a place where you can get elegant, all-american bar food, but with an upscale twist.  If you haven't been to Alexander Michael's - GO!  If you've already been, GO AGAIN!!"
1,Such a great low key place to go and have a great dinner. Their Fried pickles are amazing and have an awesome beer selection! This is my go to place for a fun relaxing evening dinner uptown.
1,"Tucked away on the outskirts of uptown/downtown Charlotte sits the cute and quaint Alexander Michael's. While my best friend and his boyfriend were in town for the holidays, we decided to stop in here for a bite to eat.  It was after 1 PM & surprisingly, the place was still packed.  This isn't saying much, because the tavern is quite small. Luckily, there were some empty seats at the bar.\n\nThey have a pretty extensive lunch menu & everything sounds good! I had a hard time choosing, but I went with the burger & cajun fries. (My second choice was the grilled cheese - maybe next time!)\n\nWe didn't wait too long until our food arrived. Holy cow (pun intended), this burger was HUGE! There were plenty of fries, too!  The burger was so tasty. It was just the right amount of juicy, without said juicy running down your wrists & arms. The bun from local Nova's Bakery was a fantastic addition. Word of caution: you will have to cut this burger in half!  Needless to say I finished my entire burger...it was only right! I wasn't able to finish the fries, but they were hot & crispy & the cajun seasoning had just enough \""bite\""...it wasn't overpowering.\n\nThe staff was so friendly & chatted frequently with us. They always made sure our glasses were filled & that we were enjoying our food. \n\nThe prices are a bit pricey, but in my case, the portion equaled the price ($9).\n\nI'll definitely be back!"
1,"One of my favorite places in Charlotte. Super cozy inside, food is something like mom would make. Great selection of local beers. \n\nFried pickles from here are a must! \n\nService is alway friendly, go there a few times and they will know you by name. \n\nIf you haven't tried it yet, this Charlotte landmark is a must!"
1,"This place is amazing. It is a hidden restaurant right in uptown Charlotte. \n\nThe food is amazing. The drinks are amazing, especially the beer selection. It is also a very good place for date night, bro night, or just night. It is so good. :D\n\n Parking is on the street and it is only for two hours without permit. Just FYI. :D"
1,"Stopped by here for an early lunch. The place wasn't crowded at all so we were immediately seated and got our drinks. The waitress and other employees were very friendly and were always around when we needed something. The food was delicious. I had the Mikes Hot Turkey Sandwich, which was pretty unique, but very flavorful. The turkey was juicy and had great flavor and the gravy was also well made on it. Alexander Michaels is definitely a place I will return to on my trip to Charlotte."
1,"Perfect hole in the wall, true pub. The half pound burger is maybe the best I've ever had and the selection of local brews is the perfect compliment. If you are a local looking for a \""regular spot,\"" or a tourist looking for that \""place only the locals know about,\"" Al Mike's is it!"
1,"This is our neighborhood tavern and I love taking out-of-town guests here.  The food is great and has a homestyle quality.  Our favorites are the fried pickles app, Beef Stroganoff and \""What it Is\"" (a nicely spiced chicken in a Cajun cream sauce over Rotini).  It's a feel-good place that definitely notices you when you walk in and remembers you when you come back.  We love the bartenders...nothing like having your favorite drink poured and ready for you AS you settle into your barstool!  And...they carry Gentleman Jack : )"
1,"Best meal I've had since moving back from Columbus! If you are ever in the area, Alexander Michael's is a must eat. I had Cajun Cream Chicken Alfredo and by far one of the best cream sauces I've had in a long time. Nothing beats prepared from scratch. The service was impeccable, not hovering over us and pressuring us to order. She made us feel like we were her only table. The prices were very reasonable and I would've paid a lot more for what I ate.\n\nThanks Alexander Michael's and Charlotte's Fourth Ward for an awesome end to my to short of a visit!"
1,One of our favorite local places in uptown. The 4th ward is very special and Alexander Michaels fits right in. We took a Segway tour one night and learned that the building is haunted too. \n\nThe fried pickles are very good and the blackened fish sandwich is delicious. There are a number of local brews on tap and the atmosphere is great. Just a great place to hang. The restaurant can get a little loud but not too bad. It is a cozy location so that is to be expected.
1,"This place is awesome. The \""what it is\""...so delicious. I'm from Cincinnati and we come here at least once any time we are in town."
1,"Perfect atmosphere. Best BLT, fried pickles and pasta salad(with Stevie's dressing.) One of my favorites in Charlotte."
1,Cindy mans the register and makes u feel welcome and at home...the fish sandwich is fantabulous and a must have. I call order my breakfast and for 3 bucks I have my breakfast to go. Gotta luv it!!
1,Very objective and incredibly well written. Deceptively large and packed with with information.\n\nPrepare to take at least an hour and be ready for a history that pulls no punches. The truth hurts and so everything from slavery and the life of the poor farmer to the whole lynching dedicated exhibit is incredibly intense and gripping.\n\nA great inspiration.
1,"I first visited this museum several weeks ago. I took in the permanent exhibit on the history of Charlotte. It is a fantastic hands-on exhibit. My kids and I truly enjoyed not only being able to read and look at historical artifacts, but also being able to touch & feel items just enhanced our experience and the knowledge that we were gaining.  \n\nToday, I took advantage of the museum's free admission, opting to start with the upstairs exhibits. Let me just say that I was moved to tears by several pieces, the artwork displayed evokes so much emotion (see the African Klan and the photography of the statues facing off).\n\nI would definitely suggest a visit to The Levine Museum of the New South to visitors and locals alike."
1,I was looking for a great steakhouse in Charlotte! I know longer have to look any further. Between the delicious anniversary steak dinner and the best wait staff; Morton's is my favorite place.
1,This is my favorite steakhouse. There are many great steakhouses out there but Morton's is always consistent.  The ribeye is my favorite cut there.  They make them perfect.  The sides are good but the steaks are so big you may not have much room for them.  I also recommend either their French onion soup or their tomato salad as an appetizer.  Definitely can't leave without having their molten chocolate cake for dessert.  The drinks for the bar are good as well.  You can end up spending a small fortune here though.
1,"So I went to Morton's on a \""date night\"" with my mom after a coworker gave her a gift certificate.  She had been there before and told me to prepare myself for probably the best meal I will ever eat.  And as much as I hate to admit this .....\n\n......she was right.\n\nLike other reviewers had stated, valet parking is a must unless you know of a perfect hidden gem of a parking lot.\n\nThe food.  Oh the food.  I was unsure what cut of steak to go with and my server recommended his favorite cut.  To be honest, I can't tell you what it was, but it was beautiful and perfectly cooked.  We ordered two sides to split.  The server told us that both of these are on their new menu which hadn't been printed yet by the time we were there.  One was a scalloped potato that was phenomenal.  But my favorite of the two sides was the creamed corn with tasso ham.  I was so enamored with it, I jotted down what was in it so I could try to replicate it at home!  Haven't tried to yet, and I'm sure my culinary prowess will get me CLOSE, but I would rather get it from Morton's.\n\nFor dessert I HAD to go with the molten lava cake which is apparently their best dessert and for just cause.  It was incredible!  If only I weren't so full on my sensational steak and sides (pardon the alliteration!), I could have finished it all.  \n\nAll in all, I WILL go back to Morton's, and I really really hope they have the creamed corn again!"
1,"I must start by the service was absolutely amazing tonight. I have read some of the reviews here and was hesitant to make a reservation but it appears that the staff tonight has works our any kinks.  Kevin the ma\u00eetre d made us feel absolutely welcome. Stephanie our server really knew the menu was able to guide is through many of our choices. We had our 9 year old daughter with us and both Kevin and Stephanie went out of their way to make her feel special. They were very impressive for a place that isn't usually \""kid friendly\"". \n\nThe food was good as usual and the steaks, although I am having a hard time believing that they were USDA Prime were cooked to perfection.  We truly enjoyed the Pork Belly \""steak\"" appetizer the the Wild Mushroom side dish that was recommended by Stephanie lived up to here raves!"
1,"Best steakhouse in Charlotte! The steaks are so tender & juicy there is no substitute for that beef. I'm also very impressed with chefs that know how to cook a steak to order, every time. We have never been disappointed with anything we've ordered, entrees to side dishes or deserts. Its all high quality food and super delicious. Whenever my husband and I get to treat ourselves we always choose Morton's, we love it!"
1,"We ordered a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon from Raymond Vineyards designed especially for Morton's called primal cut and it was boldly delicious and perfect for the steaks we ordered.\n\nSuperb aged four weeks steaks! My husband had the porterhouse and I had the NY strip both perfectly prepared medium rare! We ordered a side of mushrooms in au jus and they accompanied the steaks nicely.\n\nBefore the steaks arrived they served fresh butter and a hot boule of bread that you could smell baking because of the scent of the toasted onion on top. We also shared the Morton's salad which is greens mixed with blue cheese dressing topped with egg and anchovies. All the portions are ginormous and so easily shared!\n\nMy husband ordered the molten hot lava chocolate cake served with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce which was made to order and ordered when we ordered the steaks. It was divinely chocalatey! He also ordered a tawny port to end the meal. I had tastes and sips of both and they were delicious, and was too full to have my own!\n\nWe enjoyed sitting together in the circular booth and talking and sharing a superb meal  \nmade all the more pleasant with a wonderful waiter and maitre d'."
1,The food and service was excellent. Our sever Tara was on point. She was very knowledge. The restaurant is going through some remodeling and it gives it a more modern look. I enjoy everything and will be back
1,"I must have been in a haze of goodness that I gave a 4.5 the first time. I was recently in NC to visit my BF's family again and I dragged my boyfriend through Charlotte to all the places i went to with my family in the summer.Number one on my list was Matt's Chicago Dog. \n\nFirst I want to say, please open one in NY, SO GOOD. The char dog is amazing, just work every calorie and my boyfriend had the Chicago dog..... just superb!!!\n\nKeep it up Matt, its truly a great dog!!!"
1,"My girl and I rolled into Charlotte on a Monday at around 9. Living in New York gives one a certain confidence in finding places to dine at all hours of the night. Apparently that's not how this particular section of Charlotte gets down. We wandered around for about 20 minutes on the poorly lit, desolate streets until we found the Fox and Hound Smokehouse. \n\nNow Nature is all about balance. What Charlotte lacks in options, they make up for in value. Fox and Hound is a case in point. This is a sports bar with pool tables and lots of big screen TV's. \n\nWe got Budweisers for $2.50 and and Cosmos for $4. If I'm not mistaken, these are the prices Monday-Thursday! You don't see that in New York. Wings were 35 cents a piece, had a choice of 5 different marinades, and were quite good. \n\nGreat minds think alike. My girl and I both split some wings and got the Field of Greens salad. Greens, tomato wedges, Monterey Jack & Cheddar Cheese. Cucumbers, Roasted corn, peppers, onions and bacon pieces. I added blackened chicken to that sucker and it was crucial. The service was good and our waitress was very knowledgeable."
1,"The following things make Ri Ra amazing, no arguments. Period. End of discussion.\n\n1. McSorley's Dark, not only on draft but served in half pints as God intended.\n\n2. Colman's mustard available on request. She brought malt vinegar for my fries, sorry \""chips\"", without me having to ask. Together they are the end all, be all of chip eating.\n\n3. Super tasty and generous food. I loved the beer battered fish and chips and the pork chop with broccolini and potato cake looked (and I'm told was) great.\n\n4. Cragganmore single malt. Yes, it is pricey. A single will run you $12 but it is my favorite scotch, so I say it gets a number.\n\n5. Friendly and jovial staff. We made an open table reservation on a Friday night and though they called to say they couldn't necessarily honor the exact time, when we showed up they had our table waiting despite walk in customers waiting to be seated.\n\n6. Did I say McSorely's and Colman's w/malt vinegar? Because if I did why are we still talking?\n\nRi Ra is a classy version of the Irish pub I love to feel at home in. Go check it out. It might just save your impression of Uptown."
1,Great food. I had the hooley kebab for dinner. It was on the lunch menu but they still let me order it. Huge portion. Tasted my dads lamb stew and loved it! It was trivia night so winning 50 bones certainly helped w that 5th star;)
1,I came here alone on a Tuesday night and had the Shepherd's pie and Harpoon special which was $4 a glass. The beer was good and food delicious. \n\nIt was fairly cost effective for the area as well.
1,"It really doesn't matter if you are coming to eat, happy hour, meet up before going out or hitting this place late night Ri Ra is a great spot in Charlotte. Right down town and close to night life and the professional sector. I eat here often and I have yet to have a bad experience. Brunch here is amazing, as well as lunch and dinner. The bar tenders are really attentive and the drinks are well priced. Go here and you won't regret it!"
1,"Granted time is of the essence, but the Staff at RiRa handled our group of 19 on a thirsty Thursday evening with ease!  Don't let uptown parking scare you away from crashing this party, with the Discovery Place parking deck just blocks away RiRa is very accessible for those not living Uptown."
1,"Yea, I love a REAL Irish pub...\n\nThe folks are great the food is authentic. My favorite is the Shepard pie. \n\nSo here is a hint, If the Shepard pie is made with m Ground beef it is NOT Shepard pie.( its really Cottage pie) The good stuff is made with ground lamb.\n\nThe burgers I had were great and they actually cook them to the temp that you like. I usually order a meduim rare burger... IT WAS!!! \n\nSo it was Monday night and St Patties day to top it off. The crew remembered me from my day time lunch roamings. It was nice to have a Guiness or two, three,four...... I order a meal (don't remember what it was) but is was good and a great time."
1,"Fantastic pub atmosphere both indoor and on their rooftop area.  Great place to have a pint, share good times with friends, and enjoy the great food.  Menu prices are just a little steep but worth the price as you relish the Irish cuisine with a Guinness!"
1,This place is great. Good servers.  Takiyyah is the best. Ask for her.  Great food and a great place to bring a large group.
1,"Came here for some drinks after a rehearsal dinner. I can't speak about the food but the bartender and service was great. I expected a Friday night in downtown Charlotte to be busy and hard to get drinks but it wasn't that hard. Yes, it was busy but the bartenders were on top of it. They seemed to get to each person quickly and made the drinks quickly. I was very impressed. The drink prices seems on par for what you would expect  as well. I liked it and the atmosphere of the bar."
1,"Superb service and reliably fine food from this family owned restaurant. Briskly busy at lunchtime, relaxed at night, always comfortable. A pleasure!"
1,"We decided to give this place a try the first night my wife and I were in Charlotte for a conference / vacation. The decor instantly puts you at ease. Very comfortable, not crowded at all around 7pm on a Thursday. This place has a good selection of beer and wine as well.\n\nMy wife and I are vegan, and we had no problems finding something to eat. I ordered the General Tao Tofu, my wife got the curried tofu and veg. Simply put, our dinner was perfect. Perfect portion sizes (not too big, not too little), served hot, and fresh. Wait-staff was always available and helpful, water glasses were always full.\n\nA great place to eat out."
1,"This place is awesome.  Coming from NY where I've been spoiled with great chinese food, SoHo Bistro is the best that I've found in charlotte.  Their prices are very reasonable too.  The servers are sweet and great.  We came in with a party of 13 and the waitress memorized everyone's orders (and drinks).  I was quite surprised when everything came back perfect.  I would definitely recommend trying this place!"
1,I have never had better Chinese food. The food was fresh and no hint of MSG. The location is fantastic and centrally located to everything. It is small and intimate and they even offer vegetarian meals. I had the Lo Mein and it was so delicious. They offer drinks as well including beer and wine. The staff there is so friendly and the wait for our meal was minimal. The food was so delicious I've gone back again and again introducing it to friends and they love it as much as I do.
1,"Me, the fine newcomer Elizabeth A. and Heather X., went here on a rainy Friday at 330pm and I left wanting to come back the next day.\n\nThey still were serving lunch at 330 which ROCKED for moi, who is a chronic late luncher since my job lets me sleep in a bit :) Parking in the Hearst Tower lot is the best idea since they validate your ticket, so be sure to bring it in with you!\n\nA smaller place than I expected, there's a great, mellow vibe here. The lights that hang over the tables are beautifully warm with medium colored wood and soft white bulbs inside frosted glass. While empty when we arrived, I can definitely see this place being crowded at lunchtime between 1130-130 so heads up on that! Calling it in seemed to be a pretty good option and one that was utilized alot while we were there!\n\nStarting off with crab ragoons and asian fresh rolls, we shared and IMO the crab ragoons really shone about and beyond. The fresh rolls were good, but I wasn't a fan of the sauce they came with (reminded me of an Indian fig sort of thick sauce) and the duck sauce wasn't meshing well with it either.\n\nI ordered the General Tofu and while I feel like I'm piggy-backing onto Elizabeth's review, it was true that the tofu was PERFECT. I mean, HOLYYYY MOTHER THIS IS PERFECT. From the fry (not overly but not soggy under), to the sauce (I asked for it extra spicy, and they delivered!), to the picking of your own veggie (I choose brocoli which came out not mushy, not stiff but the almost unreachable middle ground) and the delish spring roll (something is added to this that is not in most - no clue what but it makes it hearty but still light).\n\nThe service was attentive, kind and accommodating, the space was intimate yet casual and the food was stellar. That's a WIN WIN WIN in my book! Enjoy!"
1,"I've been a regular visitor of Soho practically since they opened, which is probably close to 10 years ago at this point.\n\nIn all of my travels around the world, Soho's chinese food is just about at the top of the charts.  They use fresh ingredients, have a fantastic staff, and will alter any dish to your likings.  They have an extensive vegetarian menu, and also will make the standard meat dishes vegetarian.\n\nOwnership and staff is top-notch. It's not your run of the mill chinese place with generic sauces and formerly-frozen veggies.  Everything is fresh and wonderful."
1,The service was good and the food came out very soon after we ordered. The menu is extensive and has many different options of Thai and Chinese dishes. The menu offers anything from soup to noodle dishes to stir fry. I ordered their spicy soup with shrimp and it was very good and actually spicy and had a lot of veggies in it. The restaurant itself is but small but went during the week and it wasn't crowded at all! I would definitely eat here again and it's very close to the arena!
1,"This restaurant has been open for over 10 years,  and the food and staff has been great and very consistent.  My favorite is the Tangerine Chicken,  and my wife loves their Honey Walnut Shrimp. I've never been disappointed with my food."
1,"When I first moved here in 1995 this and Ri Ra was the only 2 places downtown. I said to myself, why the hell the I move here.  Charlotte has grown.  This place is a regular guy beer and wing joint.  It is affordable, not stuffy and you can kick back and be yourself.  The prices are reasonable.  Darryhl is a nice lady and a great barttender"
1,"When my favorite silk blouse had a run-in with a particularly evil soap dispenser, I knew my regular dry cleaner wouldn't cut it. Nicole W. recommended Eden Cleaners, so I rushed right over. Three days and $7 later, I was reunited with my blouse, looking as good as new. Aaaand, I promptly spilled carnitas and salsa down the front. And once again, Rosa gets my blouse back to me, looking like it had never stepped foot in a Mexican restaurant.\n\nThe best part, every time I stop in, Rosa tells me I'm pretty. Customer for life!"
1,"Great location downtown Charlotte, nice menu and wonderful Hand Crafted Beer Selection.\n\nSports bar atmosphere with quite a few TV's located around and a few Pool Tables too."
1,I recently visited Charlotte this past weekend for the race and needed a casual good food experience. I reviewed Yelp but most of the Downtown spots were noted as dressy or trendy attire establishments. From a 5 hour ride most of us were just comfortable in jeans and tees so nothing to dapper. The concierge at the hotel recommended the Rock Bottom so we gave it a shot. The place was excellent with its open air styling and the drinks were on spot. We ordered the southwest eggrolls as a app and started to order another plate of them and then we remembered we had more food coming! They were that good. I ordered the 14 Ribye with bourbonzola topping. Couldnt have been a more delicious and tender piece of meat. . The seaon veggies and chedder mash were no second. Everything on my plate could not have been anybetter. Check it out . It was worth the visit. And the house brews seemed to hit the spot with the guys that were with me.
1,"FiNALLY! A restaurant in Charlotte that makes up for all the bad ones. Their burgers are to die for. BEST BURGER IN CHARLOTTE! I had the Bacon Mac N Cheese which was really good but wow...my husband had the bourbonzola burger and it was delicious. \n\nThe appetizers are good too plus if you go to the Blumenthal Center for the Performing Arts and take your show ticket you get a free appetizer!\n\nThis is one of my new favorite places! \n\nThank you, Rock Bottom, for restoring my faith in Charlotte restaurants!"
1,"If I could design the perfect all-around restaurant, this would be it! Casual, but not too much. Wide range of food: from wings, to burgers, steaks, salads, fish tacos, and a ton more. New and clean inside, with an awesome bar area as well as private tables. I also love their outdoor seating, both the front and back sides. I've been coming here for almost ten years now, and still love it. The perfect neighborhood restaurant, whether you want a full steak dinner, or just wings and beer with friends."
1,"Amazing habanero shrimp appetizer, awesome Southwest egg rolls, and the fish tacos were amazing. Next time I am Charlotte I will stop here.\n\nDid I mention the beer was pretty darned good too"
1,"David Wichnoski is the best.  I woke up a few months ago with swollen eyes and since I don't wear contacts or glasses (and hadn't seen an eye Dr in many years) I was freaking out.  They squeezed me in when my original Dr refused to.  I have since been going to him for regular exams.  I highlyg recommend Spectrum Eye Care to anyone in the Charlotte area.  If you work downtown, it is very convenienntly located in the overstreet walkway.  It's also important to note that I have never waited even 2 minutes to be seen at Spectrum Eye Care."
1,"I recently visited this eye doctor after moving to the area, and had a great experience. I saw Megan Price Osborne and she was super friendly and thorough. They offered convenient appointment hours for me to stop in over my lunch hour. I had to go back to work right after so I couldn't have my eyes dilated, they said to come back whenever I had time for it, so I did and it was fast and easy. The staff has been friendly and helped me fit my glasses on several occasions, even though I hadn't purchased them there. I would definitely recommend this place from my experiences so far."
1,Much like the others that have reivewed this location and business I agree regarding their superb customer care and overall handling of my appointment.  \n\nThere was no wait regarding my eye exam.  I was brought back within 5 minutes and once into the room it might have been 1-2 minutes before the optometrist showed up to begin my glasses and contact fitting exam.\n\nOnce out of the room and back into the actual showroom I was greeted by the nice young lady out front (I think her name was Jackie).  She was more than helpful by way of using her knowledge of my healthcare eye plan to give me my best option regarding the purchases I wanted to make that day.\n\nLiterally one of the best eye exams and overall sales experience I've ever had.
1,Excellent food and good portions for the price.
1,Their food is made of magic.
1,My husband and I had the most awesome experience at Prestos our waiter Alex and Alaina were the best they suggested the shrimp & grits and the chicken martini and both were great! We will definently be back thanks for a great dining experience.
1,How can you go wrong with Heavenly Bed and Heavenly Baths? I loved this place!!! If only I could afford to stay here again!
1,"Need a place in Charlotte to get black out drunk without fear of waking up missing vital organs? Than the Westin Charlotte is the place for you. Was witness to an amateur drunk who passed out. Rather than doing the typical bounce and toss the staff gave genuine care and concern to the help him through the this moment of self reflection. One employee went so far as to ice his neck in hope to help him sober up, if nothing else at least remeber his name. Even when the EMTs arrived and drunk punches were thrown the staff stood stoically ready to show their support for their customer. So, it became a dinner and a show. Five stars.  NERD RAGE!"
1,"I stayed at this particular holiday inn last week  If you check my previous reviews I always stay in a holiday inn or candlewood when I travel (IHG brand).  While 9 out of 10 are good experiences this one takes the cake.  Based on yelp reviews we knew ahead of time about the parking fee (it is unavoidable in the center of the city)At least it is only a 1 time fee and they validate it for your stay.  After parking we go to hotel lobby to check in and were greeted by a very nice and helpful receptionist (I wish I remembered her name).  She told us that we had the best room in the entire hotel, and I truly believe it. Our room was 15th floor room 1534.  It was on the corner so we got 2 walls of windows, one side had a great view of uptown (not the arena which is behind the hotel), and the ceilings were over 12 feet high. Our king bed was comfy as always, and I always fall asleep quickly on them.\nThe hotel itself is furnished in a contemporary style, and will appeal to 9 out of 10 people.  It is located one block from the Epicenter, and only a block or two from the lightrail system for easy commuting.    The one time we had to leave parking was to travel about 3.5 miles to go to an auditorium (we saw Wicked, and it was fantastic).  Other than that there was no reason to drive anywhere since you are close to everything in uptown.  \n\nIn the beginning of my post I said that my boyfriend and myself always stay in a variety of the Holiday Inn brand hotels.  For anybody looking into hotels, I suggest you sign up for their rewards system, whether or be this one (priority club) or another chains version of it.  Hotels reward loyalty, and will do a lot to keep you loyal.  We did our research and liked the IHG brand (everything from Holiday inn express to Intercontinental)for a few reasons; they are literally everywhere so we knew that when we travel we can stay with them and continue earning points, and price-wise they stay competitive.  Our room preferences are already saved to our account (free to create).  So as a tip to everybody do a little research into hotels rewards programs, then stick to it.  If you stay with a hotel chain ten times a year, they will do a little more to keep you happy, and make up for any bad experiences you might have along the way. When I first started out with my Priority Club membership I highly doubt they would have upgraded me to the 15th floor with some of best views in the whole hotel, but because of my loyalty to them they rewarded me (at no additional cost).  The room was only $97, and that really can't be beat  for this location."
1,"The staff here is SO friendly, and the coffee is great, too!  They really make an effort to learn who their customers are and are super nice even when there is a long line.  You can tell they are doing a great business because they have 2 Starbucks, a Caribou, and a Panera in close proximity, but always have a steady stream of loyal customers!"
1,Forget about Starbucks. Coming from Miami for a business meeting I stopped here. These are the friendliest people you can find and the coffee is the best. It was a refreshing experience.
1,I love this place. I come to Charlotte all the time for work and always stay at the nearby Hilton. They have SO many kinds of coffee/tea and always have fresh bananas (my breakfast of choice!) The staff is so nice and friendly too- always cheers me up!
1,"I had an AMAZING dinner at Ratcliffe on the Green with my gf's parents.  None of us had been there before, and we were seated in the middle of this grand room with amazing architectural and design details.  The waiter does take some time to tell you all about the building and the restaurant, but I thought it was cool to learn about a place with a history in Charlotte; most things uptown seem brand new.  This place certainly does not try to be trendy like the other upscale restaurants in the area -- it prides itself on old-school tradition and fresh amazing food. \n\nOur group did the five course tasting menu with accompanying wine selections.  All but one dish was out of this world.  The crab cake was the best crab cake I've ever had in my life and the salmon melted in my mouth.  There was a mushroom pasta dish that was good, but not on par with the rest of the meal, but then again, I'm a guy that always wants tomato sauce on my pasta.  Each wine was amazing (we did the lower priced wines) and suited the food very well.  We all left full and happy.\n\nIf you have a special occasion coming up - anniversary, birthday, new job, etc., this is the perfect place to go for a memorable evening.  Try the tasting menu....or just get the crab cakes, that's what I'll be doing next time."
1,"Just took advantage of Uptown Restaurant Week and had dinner here with my sister. The Restaurant week menu came with three courses, and it was more than enough. \n\nFor starters, I had the pork belly over grits with a quail egg on top. It was the first time I have ever had pork belly, and I was very excited about it. It was incredible! It was fatty, rich, and delicious, just like I expected. The grits were unlike any I have ever had before. They were almost a combination of grits and risotto... extremely creamy and satisfying. The quail egg on top was also a nice touch. My sister had the escargot   \u00e0 la Bourguignonne. I only had a bite of hers, but they were delicious, and the puff pastry was really good as well.\n\nFor my entree, I had the mussels. They were good, but not great. For me the sauce could have used a little more flavor, it was kind of bland. My sister had the steak and potatoes. She said the steak was the best she had ever eaten. I tried a bite, and it was very flavorful and cooked to perfection.\n\nDessert really stood out for us. For dessert, I had the Apple Tart Tatin, and it was spectacular. The whole thing was delicious, but the actual puff pastry tartlet was incredible. I was full even before dessert came, but I just could not stop eating it. It was delicate, buttery, and delicious. My sister had the Creme Brulee, and it was the best that either of us have ever had. The caramelized sugar on top was perfectly crunchy, and would have made a delicious dessert by itself. The custard was delicate, yet rich at the same time. It was simply delicious.\n\nOverall, we had a great experience. We liked the atmosphere of the restaurant itself, and thought the waitstaff was very nice and attentive. This is definitely one of the best, if not the best meal I have had in Charlotte. We will definitely be going back."
1,"David Parks is an amazing massage therapist!!!\n\nI was visiting from out of town and needed a massage.  I was staying at a hotel nearby and knew Modern Salon from when I lived in the area before.  I called up and they got me in right away.  I walked in, filled out the paperwork and in walks my massage therapist.  He brought me into the room and gave me my instructions and left.  I shed my clothes and slipped under the covers of the warmed massage table. David knocked and came in and began what I now refer to as one of the best massages I have ever had in my life.  He used hot damp towels on my back, hands and feet.  It is incredibly difficult for me to \""turn my brain off\"" - even during a massage.  I actually fell asleep.   Ahhh, what stress?"
1,"If you work uptown, this is a great location for you!  I get my hair and eyebrows done here and have also have had several massages.  The staff is really sweet - they always remember what wine I like!  There is enough staff to fit your needs and price ranges.  They do reminder calls which I LOVE cause I make my appts months in advance.\n\nThere is a central desk that triages all Modern calls so if you are running late it is kind of annoying because you cant just call the location you are going to.  But the desk will let them know right away so it has always worked out....it is just odd that it is hard to get ahold of the your specific location.  Love you Modern!  I always leave feeling pampered and fabulous!  :-D"
1,"I was in town for a wedding this past weekend. I forgot to pack my heavy duty equipment to style my hair, and when I say heavy duty equipment I really mean it. My hair is long, thick, and curly. So I found Modern Salon just a few blocks away from my hotel. When I first got there the lady that took care of me was very polite even after she realized that blow-drying my hair would take a lifetime. She scurried of to speak to her supervisor or maybe a more experienced stylist for suggestions on what products or brushes to use. Nikki came along and was extremely knowledgeable with my textured type of hair; she had an amazing attitude not only to satisfy the customer but also towards the not so experienced stylist, they are lucky to have her as a mentor. I don't usually write reviews but after the experience I had at that salon I think it's worth writing a review to mention the professionalism and the positive attitude of the salon. I did mention to Nikki this is probably the first time I've ever had anyone \""understand\"" my hair. She didn't take forever to blow dry my hair because she knew what she was doing. I wish I could have taken her back home to DC, but she suggested a really good stylist in this area. :)"
1,"I recently moved to Charlotte and have been looking for a good Aveda salon. I googled locations near my office and found Modern Salon. I was able to get an appointment the day of with a junior stylist. I saw Laura and she gave me an amazing hair cut for $36 (excluding tip). I have to admit, I was nervous to see a junior stylist but I can honestly say she gave me one of the best hair cuts I've had in a long time. I definitely recommend her!"
1,This place is awesome and Gabby did a great job giving me the best haircut of my life!  Pay the extra few bucks to go here rather than get a sub par cut someplace else! Well worth it!
1,"I was in town for a family wedding, looking for a massage and waxing services. I cannot speak highly enough of this place. \n\nAdrienne, who gave my massage, is incredible. She is thoroughly knowledgeable about everything when it comes to massage, even sports massage. Ask for her, you won't be disappointed. \n\nThe people are the front desk were also very nice. Prices are reasonable and not outrageous like you might come to expect in another salons.\n\nThe place is a bit tricky to find as it is located in a building, and not on the street. \n\nOverall - can't say enough good things. Customer service is impeccable here. Would go back in a heartbeat next time i'm in town."
1,"Great location, great staff, amazing room. \nWe had a large suite with a full kitchen (and I mean full), living room with pull out couch, recliner.. bathroom vanity was large, bathroom was large and everything was extremely clean. Would definately reccomend staying again."
1,This is a great place and the people are the friendliest. I really enjoy their food. It is always fresh. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. The management is the best!
1,"The concept is typical - fast Mexican with a build your own food walk akin to Qdoba, Chipotle, Panchero's... But Salsarita's just tastes a million times better to me. I think it's the pinto beans. They're a mixture of cooked beans and smooth refried beans. Or perhaps it was the marinated chicken that almost had a smoked flavor. Whatever it was, my burrito bowl was out of this world. A madhouse of Mexican flavors for a smart price. \n\nMy stomach wasn't remotely tore up after."
1,"I didn't know this theater existed until I went to see their run of the Rocky Horror Show.  It's a great pace with an intimate feel and a good seating layout.  There really isn't a bad seat in the house (unless you have vision/hearing problems).  The beer and wine selection at their concession has much more variety than I expected and their box office is a breeze to deal with.  \n\nSeriously, how many times can you go see Phantom?  Avoid the tired mainstream stuff and check out the edgy shows that ATC is putting together.  You won't be disappointed and you might even expand your horizons."
1,"I went on Friday, Feb. 10, 2012 to see the production of \""Cuttin Up.\""  I really enjoy the quaint atmosphere, the people and the craft.  The production was awesome, Mr. Randolph did a wonderful job.  I hope to see more from him.  I will definitely put this on my \""To Do List.\""  ~"
1,"Great food, great experience - as an out of town traveler who doesn't like to eat fast food every single day, finding Mert's was a pleasure.  Keeping prices down and providing a great experience is hard at any restaurant but Mert's doesn't skimp when it comes to down home food.  The tables are basic and the look and feel are simple, but this shouldn't stop you from enjoying yourself thoroughly - beginning with their tasty fresh cornbread and continuing into barbeque whether it's ribs or pulled pork.  Although this place is in North Carolina, I was happily surprised by a sauce that didn't overpower with vinegar.  On the whole, I was very happy with Mert's and will definitely go again!"
1,I visited Charlotte last week and I ate here three times.  I couldn't help it.  \n\nSoul Food is right.  Eating here is like having a spiritual revival meeting in your mouth.  You feel like a better person after having eaten here.  A better person who will die of a massive heart attack in 5 minutes.
1,"Amazing every time.  Service can be a little slow, and some of the servers are spacey, but they are nice every time.  And my girl Paris ALWAYS is outstanding.\n\nThe cornbread is like cake; that's a good thing.  Fried chicken is always tasty.\n\nIt's what you expect.  Soul food.  Better/worse than yo momma's, depending on what kinda skillz yo momma had.\n\nDefinitely best soul food in Charlotte.  White, black, asian, or whoever, soul food knows no boundaries; everybody should be able to appreciate fried, fatty, buttery, greasy goodness."
1,"FFFFANNNNNTAASSSTICCC!!!  Wow, are all of the restaurants in Charlotte like this?  Very, very busy, but we were able to get seated within 30 minutes or so.  Waitress was great.  I ordered the shrimp and grits.  Came in a bowl with two delicious pieces of bread.  Ate every last piece.  Delicious!!  Shared the chocolate cake for dessert.  What a find!  To the woman on the flight from Atlanta to Charlotte, I say \""thank you so much.\""  Can't wait to come back to Charlotte for vacation."
1,"Oh wow. I came for brunch and made the mistake of not ordering one of their signature soul food dishes. The chicken n dumplings looked amazing, and the fried chicken was outstanding.  Now don't get me wrong, my meat lover omelet was a perfect balance of very pronounced flavors, but there are unique offerings that should be tried if you never have before.\nThe cornbread? Wow. \nThe biscuits?  Yum. \nSweet tea? But of course.\nAnd don't even get me started on the multitude of fresh cobblers and cakes available by the slice...\nPlus, Bruce Bruce and Anthony Hamilton frequent this place. And if its good enough for Bruce Bruce, its good enough for me. And a friend."
1,"We were visiting from San Diego and only in town for one day. Someone recommended Mert's for some good soul food.  Exactly what we were looking for!  The fried green tomatoes and the corn bread were absolutely amazing, I'm still craving them.  Our servers name was Jeremy and he made our experience even better.  We asked him to pick us out some of his favorites, and we were in soul food heaven.  If we ever make it back to Charlotte, Mert's will be our first stop!"
1,"Always friendly, the staff here will usually go out of their way to make sure you have a great meal. Everything I've tried is great, but special note goes to the cornbread and the catfish. The collard greens are also great, slightly tangy and with a good feel, not overcooked. This is soul food without going overboard on salt and fat. Of course, they are there, just not as much as some soul food places.  I wish they had pie."
1,"Love this place!! Food was great!! \n\nFried whiting-Meaty, seasoned well and ooooo so delectable \nMac and cheese-cheesy, tasty and just plain ol good \nGreens-good but didn't really care for the chopped onion and tomatoes a bit tart, next time I will try their string beans \nCornbread-SOOOOO tasty, moist and sweet! \n\nMy boyfriend got fried chicken, salmon cakes, mac and cheese and yams and he almost bit his fingers off!! He loved his meal \n\nService was great, the owner is so nice and friendly \n\nMy only gripe is that their isn't a location in Maryland :-( I will def be back next time I'm in Charlotte!!"
1,"Mert's deserves all of the love it is getting and more. I visit every few months for their awesome beef ribs, mac and cheese, and collard greens (I'm a collard fanatic, and these may be my favorite anywhere - and they are veg!). Lots of other good stuff on the menu as well - Soul Rolls, Chicken Tenders, Salmon Cakes, to name a few - but the ribs are hard to pass up.\nWhat really puts my love for Mert's over the top though is the ownership and the consistently good service.\nLast night, we visited, and although both Mother's Day and JCSU graduation meant they were packed, we were seated quickly, served promptly, and left happy. It was not the only time we have been impressed with the friendliness of everyone at Mert's!"
1,"Soul Food gone Gourmet!!!\n\nWalking by Mert's on my way to the Epicenter, then on my way out of the Epicenter I decided to eat here and am very glad I did!  It was a hot day and I asked for a lot of water - She brought me TWO!!!  I drank almost three!  They were real busy and I sat at a table with two ladies I had never met before (very cool and bold for the waitress to do instead of making me wait)! Though the place was packed the service was \""Faster than a Speeding Ticket\"" and great!  Everyone was very friendly and seemed to be happy to be there!\n\nHere is what I had for lunch today:  Corn Bread like CAKE with butter!  Jerk Seasoned Chopped Pork Barbecue with their \""Secret Sauce\"".  Macaroni and Cheese (the Baked kind) and Collard Greens garnished with Onions, Tomatoes, and Bacon.  All made \""with Love\""  It was all Incredible!!!\n\nFor Dessert I had Fried Chicken!!!"
1,"Oh Mert's what a great place for me to checkout on my trip to Charlotte. I wanted some hardcore authentic bbq and Mert's was my destination of choice.\n\nI ordered their legendary ribs, a side of pulled pork, collared greens and a slice of cornbread.\n\nThe ribs were great, hearty, fresh and tasty all around cooked to perfection. I was also a big fan of the collared greens, they were the best I have ever tasted.\n\nMert's is an awesome spot located right in downtown Charlotte. You really can't go wrong with choosing Mert's, everything on their menu was great.\n\nHad a fun time in Charlotte and an awesome meal at Mert's!"
1,"Cool, casual service and the home of probably the best cornbread I have ever had in my LIFE. In my view, you can't go wrong with Mert's. Happy eating!"
1,"I'm somewhat embarrassed about this review as I work in Uptown, love this kind of cooking, have known Mert's existed but have never gone!  Remedied that on Wednesday morning and seriously had perhaps the best breakfast I've ever had.\n\nI got just the basics - scrambled eggs, sausage, home fries, biscuit and a buttermilk pancake on the side.  OMFG!  Perfectly cooked eggs, two huge sausage patties that were seared on the outside and moist/tender on the inside (yes they were cooked through!)  :)  Everything was just as I would order a breakfast if it were my last breakfast on earth.  My wife had similar but substituted bacon, grits and a sweet potato pancake. she was in breakfast nirvana as well.  Even the coffee was a notch above your typical breakfast joint fare.\n\nAND...  As I sat there eating this deliciousness, I had to stare at the lunch special menu board and there was not one thing on it I wouldn't have ordered.  There is no doubt I'm coming back soon for lunch.\n\nOn the service side it was fast, friendly and really nice teamwork among the servers with everyone paying attention to coffee cups getting low, etc.  What a jewel for the Queen City!"
1,"O man, this place is amazing!\n\nOk ok, I'm not an expert in soul food or southern food, but if this is even close to what it is...uhhhh I AM A FANATIC. \n\nGotta try the beef ribs and fried catfish combo. The collard greens, okra, rice sides are not to be missed. Fried chicken was great! Cornbread that comes with the meals are not sweet but very very very buttery. \n\nOnly thing I would say was ehh was the salmon cake, that was a bit dry."
1,"Mert's Heart & Soul?  Thank you Charlotte for introducing me to this place!  The food is fantastic!  The fried chicken was a lot better the second time I went. I'm not sure what changed.  The collard greens were so good.  Now I'm not a cornbread eater but you really have to try theirs. Also, the service great!"
1,"I love this place.  This is my favorite restaurant in all of Charlotte.  The food is great, the service is exceptional and friendly, and the atmosphere is unpretentious.  I highly recommend Mert's."
1,"While visiting Charlotte from Birmingham, AL, we stopped by Mert's for lunch. We absolutley LOVED it. Our waitress was amazing and the food was even better. By far the best cornbread I have ever had in my life. When ever I come to Charlotte I'll always eat here. I had the Salmon cakes which are made with fresh salmon and I loved how spicy the collard greens were. Thanks for such a wonderful dining experience."
1,"UMM, UMM GOOD! I had to say that in capital letters just to get my point across how good Mert's is! I've been to a few soul food restaurants, where they claim \""everything is homemade\"" but when it comes to Mert's that's exactly what you get! Homemade biscuits and even ..are you ready for this? Homemade butter!! The beef ribs fall off the bone and the mac n cheese is the real deal, no boxed stuff here! \n\nThe desserts, what do you choose when you have a choice of German Chocolate, Red Velvet, Sweet Potato, Coconut Cake, Pound cake, Banana Pudding, along with Peach, Apple, & Blueberry Cobblers! The prices are reasonable, they also serve breakfast on Sat. & Sum morns which is awesome is well!  Robin the waitress is a joy to have while visiting!"
1,"We were in town for the Belk Bowl and went to Mert's for lunch.  It was excellent, staff was very friendly.  FYI, try the macaroni & cheese and cornbread with tHe honey butter, YUM!!!!"
1,"I'm writing this review as a pat on the back for the service at Mert's. The food there is awesome as reflected in other reviews & we've certainly never been disappointed. What's even better than their food though, is the wonderful service. From the time you walk in the door, you feel as if you are a guest at someone's house as opposed to a customer. They bend over backwards to bring you whatever you need and sometimes even anticipate what you may be needing before you get the chance to ask!  I highly recommend Mert's!!"
1,"Really, its as good as it gets. The food is hot and fresh. The cornbread is awesome and the service is good...I love this place."
1,"Definitely a must go to! I had the locals recommend this place to me. It was so good i ate two dinners her the same night. I had Sharon serve me and she really knew her stuff. She first suggested  the salmon cakes which were amazing with the side sauce. This is a MUST get if your trying something out there for the first time.\n\nAdd a sweet tea to it as well! Cannot go wrong with that!\n\nThen she suggested the sweet potato pie, which was AMAZING!!! It was so fluffy and tasty! And it was a nice portion as well!\n\nThen I went back later for my second dinner and I got the shrimp and grits, which was a southern classic and that was very good as well! I cannot complain, the service was amazing, they took care or me there and they really are very kind and nice to you!\n\nThey make you feel like family there and they all are very generous. Portions are great and food is AMAZING!!! Definitely eat here if your in the neighborhood!"
1,"This restaurant is my favorite restaurant in Uptown. I first visited this restaurant before I moved to Charlotte. I was walking Uptown one day and decided to give them a try. Once I saw that they served soul food, that was it for me. For one reason it is very hard to find restaurants nowadays that are homey and laid back. It feels like home when you walk in the door. You've gotta be crazy to not like the place. They serve everything from fried chicken, corn bread (with each meal), BBQ beef ribs (since I don't eat pork , that was definitely a winner for me), and lamb chops. My favorite sides are their mac & cheese, collard greens and sweet potatoes. At first taste, I thought I had died and gone to heaven. I felt like I was in my Mother's kitchen again. The food is great, the staff is great and I would recommend it to anyone. Out of all the times I've gone, there was only once that I was a little displeased with what I had ordered."
1,"Mert's is awesome! I went there for the first time in a while, and everything was as great as I remember. First up was the mouth wateringly scrumptious cornbread, fresh out of the oven and served with plenty of butter. I liked it so much that I asked for more when my entr\u00e9e arrived. I had the salmon cakes, which were the best I have ever eaten. These are not your grandma's salmon cakes- no canned stuff here. This was fresh salmon which they poach in house. It was perfectly seasoned, nice and moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. It is served with a remoulade that compliments it perfectly. My two sides were candied yams and okra and tomatoes. The Yams were delicious- not overly sweet but still nice and gooey and pleasing. The okra and tomatoes were good, although interestingly enough, there were no tomatoes in my serving. Just okra. It didn't matter. I gobbled it up anyway. Everything was served promptly and at the proper temperature, the d\u00e9cor was warm and welcoming, and the service helpful and friendly. You should have nothing to complain about if you come to Mert's, unless you are a chronic complainer. In that case, you should go home and cook and let the staff come to your house and complain about your cooking."
1,"Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet.  I used to live uptown and would come here for lunch often.  I'm not a cornbread fan but I do love their cornbread. \nI also finally had their chicken tenders over the weekend and they were excellent.  I debated between the salmon cakes or the chicken tenders and decided to try something different and I'm glad I did.\nI had the mac and cheese and collard greens as my accompaniments and I was pretty full, but couldn't take a doggie bag since I was headed to SMG for a movie :(\n\nThis is the place I try to take out-of-towners and point tourists towards since to me this is Charlotte cooking and it has a great location uptown on College."
1,Not only was the food wonderful but the staff are friendly.  The ribs are sooooo tender and the red beans & rice are fabulous.  The cornbread is YummmmmY.
1,"I love this place.  There was a time when I ate here twice a week.  The food is amazing and very true to its Gullah/Carolina roots of down-home, Southern cuisine.  Everything is fresh, delicious, and remarkably low-priced."
1,"Excellent! Home cooking, friendly service and the pies are amazing!!"
1,"Went there with my parents (who are incredible health freaks) but wanted to try southern food, and we all loved it despite (or because off??) all the fried stuff. We ordered a Southern Sampler and a Soul Sampler, and it was perfect for the three of us. Granted we all eat like birds, but literally EVERYTHING was absolutely delicious and very cheap! It was a beautiful day, so we sat outside and had a wonderful dinner with good service."
1,"Where to begin...\n\nEven the bread and butter served to each table is utterly delicious! Located conveniently in the downtown, Uptown, the restaurant exuded southern hospitality. The smell of fried everything wafted from the kitchen. Sign posters on the walls showed pretty much every stage actor ever had stopped in. And the staff was friendly as could be.\n\nAs for the food, there was absolutely nothing that feel short of expectations. Fried tomatoes, mmm mmm mmm! Green beans cooked in delicious country ham juices. Fried Chicken, salivating good!\n\nOur waitress kept emphasizing desserts. We went ahead and got some strawberry shortcake, a sweet explosion of flavor later, we exited satisfied, with smiles on our faces, and about 5 pounds heavier."
1,"I finally made it to Mert's for dinner. I got the beef ribs. They were pretty good. The Mac and Cheese was delicious and a little burned on the bottom, just the way I like it. My dad got the chopped pork barbeque and loved it. I could eat that cornbread all night. Every time we've ever been here, the service has been extremely friendly which pushes them from 4 stars to 5 stars. I will definitely be back and next time I'll have to save room for desert."
1,"Best soul food in Charlotte. Other than the clogged arteries, nothing to complain about. The cornbread is amazing by the way, probably the most memorable part of my meal."
1,"YUMM CORNBREAD. This place probably has the best cornbread I've ever had in my life. Period.\n\nI was in town for a day, and wanted to pick up somethingfor the road. My colleagues recommended Mert's, and I'm glad I went. I ordered a catfish, collard greens, and acorn squash for me, and a beef tips, mac n' cheese, and collard greens for the special guy picking me up from the airport. I gobbled down the cornbread right away, it was so delicious. Now I know nothing tastes as good as when it's first made, but for surviving a 10-hour trip, these meals were pretty darn good.\n\nHighly recommend!"
1,"Soul food that make your heart smile. \n\nEvery time i visit da south for work I get excited about new bbq and soul food spots that I get to try. This place alone made my trip worth while. \n\nHad the jumbo wings with mac and cheese, collard greens, and cornbread.Everything was delicious and had a unique touch. The collard greens were the best I've ever had.\n\nThe selection and customer service here was outstanding. They even have a phone app, how cool right ?\n\nCan't wait to come back and get me some more Mert's."
1,"If you want a tasty soulful brunch on a Saturday morning, Merts is the place to go.\n\nOutdoor seating, pet friendly, and the best fried chicken  in Charlotte!  The organic yellow grits are out of this world good.  I didn't care for their biscuits, but everything else was mouth-watering good!!! \n\nThe coconut layer cake is light, fluffy bites of heaven on a fork!!!"
1,"We've been on a search to find great southern soul food in Charlotte and this place is definitely at the top of the list so far. The location uptown on College next to the theatre was perfect. The service was excellent. The Perch was perfectly prepared. The baked macaroni and cheese was by far the best I have ever tasted. The Collard Greens, Black Eyed Peas, Cabbage and Oh Oh Oh that Corn Bread. The banana pudding had a surprising cake bottom and perfect texture. The ice tea was perfectly sweetened. The kids loved the chicken strips which looked buttermilk battered and very moist inside. Definitely worth the drive. There is no valet but you can park at the Holiday Inn garage and they will validate you."
1,"Breakfast food is excellent, so is the service and restaurant."
1,"1. CORNBREAD!\n2. Amazing southern food, everything was equally delicious. Great place to feel at home and fix your craving for fried chicken and all things southern.\n\nTheir cakes look incredible too. Try and save room, I wasn't able to and regret not taking a piece to-go."
1,"While visiting Charlotte, we wanted a place within walking distance from our hotel, The Hyatt House (fabulous place). We found the perfect restaurant on Yelp and quickly chose Mert's Heart & Soul. I love comfort food so this was my heaven. I had blackened pork chops with collards and mac&cheese. The mac&cheese was so delicious that I almost ordered a second round. My husband had the ribs and fried chicken combo with collards and mashed potatoes. I tasted his and it was yummy too. The cornbread loaves were scrumptious with the sweet butter. So not to be left hungry later when we returned to our hotel, we ordered the soul rolls & smoked turkey with beans & rice plus dessert- coconut cake, banana cake & caramel cake. All of the cakes were moist and full of flavor. \nOur waitress, Malika was great! She was funny, attentive and pointed us in the right direction with her recommendations. She made our dinner a complete success. We will definitely be visiting again and asking for Malika when we return."
1,"Great food, great prices, great staff, great atmosphere. Go here!  Had the breaded chicken special with okra and cabbage and it was amazing.  Tons of flavor and perfect portions!  Southern cookin at its finest."
1,"Good, honest food, at a fair price, made by cheerful folk. I've been going there for years, and am rarely disappointed."
1,"Jersey Mike's Tuesday Special is awesome. $7 for any regular sub, chips & a drink. It's usually the only day that I drink soda."
1,"Absolutely fantastic. My husband and I were staying in downtown Charlotte last month and went to Mimosa Grill on a Friday night for dinner. We were looking to have a delicious, upscale meal and that is exactly what we got. They had a great (and reasonably priced) wine selection. The chef sent out a really nice parsnip puree amuse-bouche for us, it was so tasty. I got the Pecan-crusted Trout as my entree and it was one of the top 5 entrees I have EVER had. It was absolutely delicious, what an incredible dish. I'm still thinking about it a month later. It has apparently been one of their restaurant staples - that doesn't surprise me. Our waiter told us that Emeril had been in the restaurant a week earlier and gave his compliments to the chef for the same dish. My husband got the Peppercorn crusted filet which was also fantastic. They did a wonderful job on it considering they're not a steakhouse.\n\nOverall a WONDERFUL restaurant. My only complaint would have to be the background music - AWFUL. The restaurant is so elegant and lovely, and they were playing terrible pop music in the background. Hopefully they'll switch to Miles Davis by my next visit!"
1,"Excellent service!! Brooke and Hannah are awesome servers!! Food was excellent, chocolate Sauce was scrumptious !! The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e is amazing!!"
1,"Came here with a small group for a business dinner.  The staff were VERY friendly, professional, and helpful.  They seemed in a good mood and provided very nice recommendations for wine, appetizers, and meals.\n\nThe wine selection is incredible but, i was disappointed with the tap beer selection.  Normally, I would ding a place for that but, this is the South and, beer is not considered a food staple as it is back home in Wisconsin.  Also, this is a pretty fancy place and, they tend to focus on wine.  According to my colleagues that are very into wine, the selection was quite good.\n\nI had the pork chop for myself, which was served beautifully but, a bit under cooked.  I ordered medium rare, it was rare.  They were very prompt and gracious about it - brought me a new one, perfectly cooked, and offered me a variety of other things to tide me over while I waited (it only took them 10 minutes to bring the new one).  It was cooked beautifully, very tender, well seasoned (balanced, you could tell it was quality pork), and it wasn't a \""chop\""....it was tenderloin meat on the bone...a very nice piece of pork.\n\ni will definitely come back!"
1,Fish and chips were great.  People should not come here for lunch and discuss business.  Enjoy your meal as if it were your last.
1,"Love this place!   Southern cuisine with a modern twist!  Great food, friendly & professional service, and great atmosphere.  My favorite dish is the pecan trusted trout."
1,"Okay so I was just going about my day and it dawned on me - MAN, I HAVE TO WRITE A REVIEW FOR THIS PLACE!\n\nSo here I am, stopping everything to tell you how awesome this place is.  I'm in town for business and wanted a low key dinner by myself.  It had the feel of a Firebirds but with a farm to fork mentality that was out of this world.  I had an autumn salad and - I know what you're thinking, \""really?  This girl is getting excited about salad?\""  Yes, yes I am.  It had thinly sliced apples, bacon, goat cheese, crispy black eyed peas and a lemon pepper vinaigrette - simply amazing.\n\nThen I went for a side of sweet potatoes in back fat gravy (is that even what that's called?  I'm a Northerner by nature but wow, I walked back to the hotel practically skipping because of the complex deliciousness) and a side of cremini mushrooms and goat cheese (another standing ovation). \n\nOverall, I may drive to Charlotte again just to go back.  Wow!"
1,"Absolutely fabulous. Our waiter, Adam, was great. The food was great. I'd go back here in a heartbeat.\nThe heirloom tomato salad may be the best thing i've ever eaten."
1,Went here for dinner last weekend Saturday. The food was great the service was great. Would love to go there Again and try everything on the menu.
1,"An awesome dinner on Valentines.  The trout entr\u00e9e was possibly the best combination of flavors, textures, and presentation in a dish that I've ever experienced.  The ambiance is great and I'd imagine a spring reservation on the patio would be top notch overlooking the plaza.  Few places balance setting and service without being pretentious.  This is one of those places.  I'll be sure to return."
1,"fantastic! great service, atmosphere was lovely and the food was delicious! \n\nwent in for a quick dinner last night and the brought over warm rolls and recommended a few entrees. I started with the beet salad and would highly recommend it! pretty large portion for an appetizer salad. had the salmon for my main course and it was cooked to perfection! \n\nwould come back here next time I'm in the area!"
1,The first time I have ever asked my server to get me the recipe for a dish! The Carolina coastal catch is hands down one of the best dishes I've ever had. Great place to celebrate our anniversary!
1,"The best Italian Experience I have ever had in the Charlotte area. I am Italian, grew up in an \""Italian\"" kitchen, my mom owned an Italian restaurant and my dad a pizzeria trattoria, so I know my Italian and this place was an all around perfect dining experience. I tried: the gnocchis, lamb, stuffed chicken and tuna and all of the dishes were melt-in-your-mouth amazing. Highly recommend!"
1,We love it and the veal sage ravioli is amazing. The Osso Buco to die for. This is not a place you go everyday but they own a lot of other places here in Charlotte. So you can get the same qaulity and a little less pricey. Osteria Coco in front is the and I believe meaa luna too.Really good Northern Italian Food
1,"This review is for their lunch sitting...\n\nWow....that one word sums up this place for lunch.  If you would have told me that I would be able to have a sitdown two-course lunch for $12.95 in Uptown, I would have told you you were crazy.  This place proved me wrong.  Considering my burrito, chips, and drink combo from Qudoba or salsaritas pushes $10, Luce was a real breath of fresh air.\n\nA fantastic variety of primi and secondi options, as well as daily specials, and you will be able to return to this same restaurant and never get bored.  The great menu options, along with militarily efficient service, makes this the go-to spot for folks who work in the uptown area and have a limited time for lunch.  \n\nI recommend the authentic ceasar with anchovies and fresh shaved parmesan.  They had a tomato and goat cheese soup as a daily special that was out of this world as well.  The Mare pasta was amazing....tons of fresh seafood throughout this dish.  Most places would serve the pasta itself at $12.95.  Instead, I got fresh bread with a white bean and olive oil aperitif, ceasar salad, and seafood pasta for my money.  Can't beat it!"
1,"My wife and I had a very nice dinner at Luce on a Wednesday night to celebrate our anniversary.   The food was excellent and the service was superb.  I ordered the Carbonara as an entree and she had a ravioli dish, and we had a very nice and light  salad, heirloom tomatoes with basil, EVOO, and cheese.  The tiramisu for dessert was also very good.  All in all, it was a nice experience and I would not hesitate to return to Luce for dinner."
1,"Great place. Excellent experience. Had the scallops for my main dish. Amazing!  If I could give this place 10 stars, I would."
1,"My fianc\u00e9e and I visited Luce on our last evening in Charlotte, a Wednesday night in November.  We arrived at about 6PM without a reservation and were seated immediately.  The staff had no objection to our sitting for half an hour eating olives and sharing a single cocktail to pass some time before we ordered our main meal.\n\nAs many other reviewers have mentioned, the olives are excellent.  So was the negroni.  The ambiance was authentically Italian (and we have been to Italy before): intimate, quiet, and comfortable.  A lot of this is due to the wait staff, who are all at least ethnically Italian, and in some cases rather adorably fresh-off-the-boat.\n\nWhen we finally got around to ordering dinner off of their fall menu, we settled upon a meal with one main course and contorni to share.  My fianc\u00e9e had (A) the spinach papardelle with oxtail rag\u00f9 and I had (B) the risotto ai frutti di mare (a daily special).  To share, (1) cannellini beans with escarole and (2) spinach fried with garlic.  Upon the waitress's recommendation we also ordered one glass of Sangiovese to accompany the entire meal.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e is allergic to most dairy, and when she asked whether the rag\u00f9 had any milk in it, the staff's immediate answer was \""Not that one,\"" which really is the most reassuring answer that one can possibly get.\n\nThe food was, on the whole, marvelous:\n\n(0) The first thing to arrive after we'd ordered was a cold cannellini bean salad with peppers, onions, and basil, served with bread.  Every table got this.  It made a great opener.\n\n(A) The pasta was house-made.  Good, though we have had better - but that was in Italy.  The rag\u00f9 was excellent, with the flavors of tomato, oxtail, wine, and carrot in good balance, and an amazing mouth feel.\n\n(B) My seafood risotto had clams, scallops, calamari, shrimp, and mussels.  The key to seafood is freshness, and what went into my dish was certainly very fresh, with no off-flavors whatsoever.  For my part, I could also taste that they used very high quality cream.  The rice, unfortunately, was a bit grainy.  My guess is that they had one pot of it cooking continuously throughout the night, and that since we arrived early in the night, the risotto actually wasn't quite done.  Nevertheless, the flavors were so good and well-melded that I hardly minded.\n\n(1) The cannellini with escarole was perhaps the one disappointment of the night.  The escarole was blanched first, so it lost its signature bitterness, which we both expected it to contribute to this dish.\n\n(2) The spinach with garlic was 'a good straight line' as the two of us put it.  Is there a cuisine in the world which -doesn't- like spinach stir-fried with garlic?\n\nWe finished with coffee; our waiter commented upon our ordering coffee instead of desserts, \""yeah, that's how we do it in Italy.\""  I had black and she had espresso.  The espresso was very well made, and my coffee definitely benefited from (again) the very good cream.\n\nOur whole meal ran us $85 including tax before tip, and included two drinks, two main courses, two side dishes, and two coffees.  We weren't billed for the tiny plates of olives we had during cocktails, so we left extra tip to match the staff's generosity.\n\nLuce is the most authentic Italian dining experience we have had in the United States."
1,"One of the first places I ate in Charlotte and it was certainly memorable. The white table cloths, the relaxing atmosphere, the chance to take a minute and enjoy the rest of your night after a very long day.\n\nAnd the mussels. Lord Have Mercy, the mussels. Luce is worth going for the appetizers and desserts and enjoying a wonderful night."
1,"We had a wonderful, authentic Italian meal on New Year,s Eve. The service was friendly, I rushed. Can't wait to return!"
1,"My husband and I ate here before seeing 'Book of Mormon'.  Everything was great - food, service, etc.  We don't eat out often at nice places anymore, so it was a relief to have a good experience that was worth the money.\n\nWe tried the lobster bisque,homemade ravioli (I ordered the plain cheese, old-school version because I knew it would be good), osso buco (my husband always orders this if it's on a menu), and Chilean seabass (this used to be my go-to dish but since it's now overfished and politically incorrect I try to abstain).  Accompanying risotto was good.  My only complaint was that there were no veggies on the plates (although you could order spinach as a separate side).  Maybe restaurants have moved away from this because people don't eat them and they go to waste.\n\nI highly recommend Luce for an excellent pre-show dinner."
1,I can't think of anything due to my food coma but it was all five stars!  The blackberry sorbet was a perfect finish.
1,"This restaurant really does deserve the awards that adorn their walls!! My partner & I had a truly \""spiritual\"" food experience here. The menu is full of mouth-watering authentic Italian dishes....that please the palate & leaves you wanting MORE.\nWe will visit Charlotte NC again & again just to eat at this restaurant..."
1,"Nice hotel, nice warm cookies!  I have stayed at this one twice and would recommend to out of towners."
1,"In town for the Belk Bowl Game. The room was average size and had a sort Chaise chair for relaxing. The bed was very comfortable. \n\nOne highlight was the excellent staff. Room service was fast and the food very tasty. When we had a problem with the in room safe, a technician was at the door within 10 minutes and fixed it immediately. Even brought up a new key after getting the safe fixed. \n\nThe breakfast buffet had a good selection and as a Gold HHonors member, free.\n\nParking was not cheap ($13) but convenient \n\nI would stay again"
1,"Great first impression.  Lobby looks very clean and nice, staff are friendly, the hallway on the 8th floor is bright, clean and feels cool, not warm and muggy like some hotels.  \n\nThe rooms are very nice and contemporary, with nice clean corners.  The bathroom is clean, one of the best I've seen.\n\nThe AC has a motion sensor which is annoying, I was able to get the staff to bypass it and I was able to get the temperature down to 60.  Which feels very pleasant.\n\nGot my warm cookie, breakfast coupons and free Internet for being a diamond member.\n\nI never tried breakfast, even though I had free breakfast coupons I was simply too lazy to wake up early enough to try it.\n\nThe gym was nice, they had free weights, 2 treadmill (one was broken) and 2 elliptical machines.\n\nParking was in a parking structure that requires your hotel card or pay as you go.\n\nI would recommend this hotel."
1,"I'm from Chicago suburbs, so I'm used to townie dive bars and this place is great! The service was great! Richard, the manager was fantastic and made us feel at home. They were playing the Hawks game on the tvs and any bar playing the Hawks is a bar of mine! You HAVE to try the virtual bowling game! So much fun!!"
1,"To my dearest Dylan,\n\nI saw you from across the restaurant and I knew you were a five star kind of guy but little did I know I was about to get five star service! Most people are made up of 70% water, yours is sparking, like San Pellingrino. The good stuff. You are a true angel. Thank you for that side of caramel and the Caribbean Lemonade recommendation. Take all my money. Take everything Dylan. You already took my breath away. Dylan? More like Lady Killin'! Miss you already...\n\nSincerely, \nYour two humble patrons."
1,"I absolutely LOVE the bronx bomber and the chilli they offer both great choices ! I eat here alot and it never fails to disappoint .. great salads the server knows my favorite \""supreme like\"" pizza ... they always give me healthy suggestions and alternatives to try. I love it. Very convenient and quick.. great atmosphere.  Some of the lunch staff could do a better job with timeliness and checking on the customers."
1,"There are two things that are important to me in a hotel: cleanliness and service. This hotel meets both those criteria as my room was spotless upon arrival and they let me check-in at 10:30 am (standard time is 3 pm). It is very centrally located - literal overlooks the NASCAR museum (not that I would ever go there). Valet parking is $15, but it is easier to self-park for $10 as the garage connects to the hotel on floors 4 and 5."
1,"I was in Charlotte for a class and stayed here. It was really nice, and the staff was great! I had never stayed alone in a hotel and got upset while eating in their restaurant and the wait staff took care of my meal! It was so nice! I can't say enough nice things about them! They made my trip better and made me feel so welcome! I'd definitely stay there again!"
1,"Ooh La La, Capital Grille is the most Ritzy and detail oriented restaurant in Charlotte, to help you understand what I mean allow me to tell a little story:  It was my Girlfriend's Birthday and I wanted to make a good impression on her, so I decided to take her to Capital grille in Uptown Charlotte.  I called and made reservations, they were very nice and completely accommodating over the phone.  We arrive on time for our reservations and we are greeted by the hostess who is the first to tell my girlfriend Happy Birthday, everyone inn the restaurant from the servers to the bus boys said hello to us and wished my girl a happy birthday.  When we arrived at the table it was covered in a very classy looking glitter and decorations specifically yfor the occasion.  They made us feel like movie stars, and she thought I was amazing because I had set all this up, but really it was all Capital Grille. So right away the service has set the scene for us to have an excellent night.\n\nThen came the food, we started with a round of gin and tonics, good, and a crab cake appetizer which was amazing, chunks of perfectly seasoned crab meat, and just enough to wet our appetites for the main course.  She ordered the fillet Mignon, and I got the porterhouse.  It was spectacular.  The meat is aged in a glassed in room, which you can see when you first walk in, and tastes incredibly rich, with many layers of flavor, from the smoked grilled aspect to the texture of the aged beef, ummm, I even took the bone home and gnawed on it the next day, it was that good.  The mashed potatoes were really good too.\n\nCapital grille is perfect for special occasions, a little pricey, but when you're celebrating, this is the place to go all out."
1,"Fine dining and elegant decor without the pretentious attitude.  Great happy hour bar with the famous \""Paul\"" bartending since 2004'.  Ask for a Stoli Doli Pineapple Martini and you will not regret it.  The Porcini Delmonico Steak and Lobster Mac n Cheese rule!!"
1,"I have now been here for dinner twice  and can fully commit to the 5 star rating!  In December a friend brought my sister and I here for our Xmas present.  LeeAnn D's review summs up that experience perfectly except she left out the bread basket.  I swear I could have been happy just sitting there eating bread all night, it was such a great selection!\n\nThe last time I was here was for restaurant week.  As a thank you for the meal in Dec, the manager gave my friend a $50 gift card for a return visit that had to be used by beginning of Feb, so we decided to eat here again.  Mixed green salad was good, dressing on the side though otherwise it drowns the lettuce.  Porcini rubbed tournedos of beef were excellent, and I actually couldn't finish both.  The mashed potatos were probably the best I have ever had anywhere.  You just knew there was 3 sticks of butter and a ton of heavy cream in there, but they were simply amazing.  The creamed spinach however, tasted like soap, bleh.  Our server replaced them when we told her they tasted funny, but the 2nd batch just had a milder soapy flavor.  Still this was not enough to ruin an otherwise perfect meal.  Creme brulee to finish up and the chocolate espresso cake to go since my friend doesn't care for dessert, was a great ending to the meal.\n\nWith the gift card and the restaurant week pricing it made this meal with 4 glasses of wine and 2 cocktail about $43 pre tip.  Tip on the pre discounted amount and we still walked away paying $60 for a meal that could have been A LOT more expensive.  I almost felt like we were stealing since I know how pricey this place can be!"
1,Top Notch steaks and service.  My recommendation (if you're really hungry) order the Porterhouse...medium rare.  And please pay the few extra dollars for the Porcini Rub - you'll thank me...   Table 23 is one of the best for privacy if you have 3 to 4 joining you..
1,"If you don't like this place, you don't like any place.  If you don't have 300 bucks to spend DO NOT GO.  Food-EXCELLENT.  Service- EXCELLENT drinks-EXCELLENT.  Eating there is like being on a cruise.  It is by far the best resturant in Charlotte, maybe the USA.  I have been there 10 times and will continue to go.  BTW the valet parking is a nice touch."
1,Great service and wines. Best calamari in town
1,"One of the best Steakhouses, always consistent. Great food and service. You can people watch at the bar"
1,"I had a $40 filet mignon at Ruth Chris a few days before eating here.  For the same price, the filet at Capital was 10 times better.  I would have paid double.  Amazing place, wonderful service, and everything we ate was beyond what we could have hoped for."
1,"It's been many years since we've been to The Capital Grille.  My employer used to treat us during the holidays after we worked 12-15 hour days/nights decorating the lobby for Christmas.  It was my first time trying calamari and the Stoli Doli - both sublime.  As was everything else I consumed.  I've been wanting to return since then, but budgetary restraints prohibit.  Hopefully we'll go again someday."
1,"Somehow my review got moved to the Yelp event page. Reposting here...\n\nEvery once in a while, you have an experience at a restaurant that's so lovely, you know you'll remember it for years. The meal we ate at the Capital Grille this week doubtlessly falls into this category.\n\nI know that Capital Grille is a chain, and an expensive chain as well. I'm not usually super excited about corporate steakhouses (Ruth's Chris: meh), and I usually wouldn't have chosen one for a Restaurant Week outing. However, Capital Grille treated us so well during the Yelp Generous Pour event, we decided to return. I'm glad we did: the food and the service were both amazing.\n\nI'll talk about the food first. Their Restaurant Week menu is not very varied: they offer three steak entrees and one salmon dish. However, I don't see that as a downside, since if you're looking for something lighter and/or vegetarian, you're not going to go to a steakhouse, anyways. For my entree, I ordered the Kona-encrusted sirloin with shallot butter.. oh my. This was a good steak, folks: tremendous flavor and perfectly cooked. I've learned that this steak is on their regular menu as well. This could be bad for my credit card. The appetizer of clam chowder was good, if not exceptional. My dessert of creme brulee was delicious. Nevertheless, it was all overshadowed by that steak.\n\nOk, now let's talk about the service. Yes, my steak was amazing, but you can get an amazing steak at other venues. What really set this night apart was the level of service we received. Even though it was Restaurant week, and even though we had nibbled and sipped for free the weekend before, we were treated as well as they could have treated any bank executive or local politician. Our waiter, James, was unobtrusively attentive and poured us multiple glasses of wine on the house. The manager checked in on us and shook our hands on the way out. I've never been treated better in a restaurant, especially when eating a meal at such a considerable discount.\n\nIn case you can't tell from the above, we really had a fantastic evening. I suspect that we'll be back the next time we have an excuse to splurge."
1,"Really fantastic steaks and a lively upscale crowd make this downtown old school style steakhouse a winner. It's a meat lover's paradise and often has a bustling bar with upscale business people drinking $14 martinis and lots of talkative business crowds in the dining room. The decor is intentionally stuffy (old men oil paintings), but the superb service and lively tables drinking vino & laughing make it a winner. Perfect for Platinum Cards and big per diems. Great wines! (It's a close second to Fleming's for Steaks and sides, however, this place has a much more lively bar and dining room.)"
1,I havent been here in about 8 years due to a bad meal I had long ago that I couldnt shake.  So I decided while I was Uptown having lunch to give it another go...it has been afterall about 8 years.  I have to say I was extremely impressed!  Everything was exceptional and well made.   Our waitress Alex was so sweet and knew the menu well and recommended the lobster bisque which wasnt on the menu.  It was perfection!  HUGE lumps of lobster meat swimming in a rich creamy broth.  OMG..it was so good.  Plus the truffle fries are the best Ive had in Charlotte so far!  The manger Bryce was so nice and accomodating.  He went out of his way to make the experience great.  Will not hesitate to return!
1,"I went there this past Saturday night in a party of seven that included two kids (12 and 14). I did not know that they had valet parking as that would have been very useful on a busy uptown Saturday night. Anyway, seating was very prompt as we had a reservation.  I was dressed up quite nicely but most of my party were casually dressed and no one felt uncomfortable. They do have a dress code but I understand that they are lenient.  The service was just so impeccable! Prompt but not intrusive, attentive, courteous, friendly but not overly so, just top notch.  Sorry I forgot our waitress name but she was very helpful in explaining the dishes so that even the kids could understand. Well the food was just outstanding also. We ordered a lot of appetizers to share and all of them were  delightful.  Special mention; the Pan Fried Calamari with hot peppers ( that sure didn't last long!), the creamy  Mashed  potatoes (the best I've ever had), the Lobster and Crab Cakes and the Lobster Mac'N' Cheese (just divinely delicious!). We also had various vegetable sides but I didn't sample many of those.  For the main courses, all the adults had different steaks on the menu. Mine was the Steak au Poivre with a creamy French sounding sauce. It was beautifully tender at medium rare and spiced just right. Everyone raved about their steaks. The kids had their Chicken tenders (?) which was not on the regular menu but the waitress arranged it. The ambience was classy but not stuffy. We were not loud but pretty chatty and never felt rushed or uncomfortable. The vibe was bustling but relaxed for the guests. Only one person had dessert, everyone else were too full. The bill ( which I didn't see fortunately, thanks bro!) must have been quite high but it was well worth it.  Everyone was happy, no complaints of any kind. Would absolutely go again on special occasions."
1,This is heaven for steak lovers like me! High quality and moody...I enjoyed my time very well.
1,Took my husband here for his bday sometime in the beginning of November. I told then ahead of time that it was his birthday and the did really special things. It was expensive but he was happy the food was great and free v parking. Not bad at all would do it again. He says this place has the best steak. We even got a picture to take home.
1,I dine here pretty regularly and it's always been amazing. My favorite thing on the menu is the lobster crab cakes. They're an appetizer but I love them so much I often order them as an entree. All the steaks are wonderful. Never had a bad meal here!
1,"I've been dying to come here to get my steak on, but the menu prices are downright daunting! This time around we made reservations to partake in their Restaurant Week menu, and it is the most affordable way to experience one of the better restaurants in the area.\n\nThe Capital Grill may be a chain, but it definitely doesn't feel like it. From the interior decor to the service to the actual food, everything screams upscale fancy-smancy...not something that is usually associated with a chain. We made reservations (highly recommended) and were seated almost immediately.\n\nOur server was very friendly and brutally honest. I guess she was forced to try to upsell us a $17 glass of wine but then told us how ridiculous it is and we shouldn't bother with it. When we did choose a bottle of wine she detoured us to a different bottle that was the same price but was more well-received. I'm glad we went with her recommendation because it ended up being an awesome bottle that we would have overlooked otherwise. \n\nFor the first course of the Restaurant Week menu I had the New England Clam Chowder. I am a sucker for clam chowda and this stuff was great. It wasn't overly heavy with cream and had a ridiculous amount of succulent clam chunks in it. This chowda definitely didn't skimp on the seafood, and the clams, potatoes and bacon were all melded nicely for some of the best I've had in awhile. The missus got the field green salad which was very nice, and came with an excellent champagne dressing that worked very well with the veggies. I was almost a little jealous of her salad, but I had chowder in front of me, so that feeling didn't last long.\n\nThe Restaurant Week menu was decent for entrees, with a few steak options as well as a chicken and salmon. I ordered the 14oz bone-in sirloin and this was one of the most magnificent steaks I've had in the Queen City. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare just as I ordered it, and it was a tender, juicy, tasty steak with an excellent beef flavor. It was such a huge steak that I only ate half and saved the rest for a leftover dinner the next night! \n\nThe missus had the Citrus Glazed Seared Salmon. It was a very nice piece of salmon that wasn't overpowering, and the glaze was really tasty. Her plate also came with some roasted asparagus that were cooked perfectly and had a nice sauce drizzled on top. Our table was also served shared side dishes of mashed potatoes and green beans. The potatoes were crazy rich, creamy and delicious, and there were still a few nice lumps mixed within the majority of the velvety mass, making these potatoes freaking awesome. The green beans were also tasty, and were tossed with tomatoes to give it a little extra pop.\n\nFor dessert we both shared the Cheesecake and Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake. The cheesecake was actually more like a mousse, and so it was light as opposed to dense. It tasted wonderful and the top is caramelized to give it a crisp bite. It was served alongside a few berries and strawberry glaze, which made one delicious mouthful. The chocolate cake was just as good, if not slightly better. The espresso flavor is very light so if you're not a coffee fan don't be afraid to give this a whirl. The consistency of the cake was more like a chewy fudge, making it extremely decadent. \n\nThe Capital Grill is the place to go, so long as you have to cash. The food is all excellent and I would love to go back and try some other stuff out. The ambiance, service and food all scream swank, and it definitely feels like it warrants the extravagant price tag."
1,"For my money, there is no steakhouse as consistently outstanding as The Capital Grille. Whether I'm in Atlanta, D.C., or Charlotte, their steaks are always cooked to perfection, their service always world class, and their wine selection second-to-none.\n\nMy wife and I recently dined at the Charlotte location during the Queen's Feast Restaurant Week, and for the absurdly low price of $30 a person, each enjoyed a delicious 8-oz filet, two sides and a dessert. As luck would have it, our local Restaurant Week happened to coincide with the Capital Grille's Generous Pour event, so we each enjoyed glasses of four different red wines for just $25 each. When the bill finally arrived, we couldn't believe what an incredible deal we just had!\n\nI could go on about why The Capital Grille is far and away my favorite restaurant, but you'll have to experience it yourself to understand. There's no better place to celebrate a special occasion, take a client for a business lunch, or just enjoy a fantastic steak."
1,"We were greeted with \"" Happy Annversiary\"" and two glasses of Champagne.  I though the champagne was actually quite delicious.  We had lobster-crab cakes for appetizers.  There was quite a bit of lobster in the cakes and they were scrumptious.  We shared a 10 oz Filet  which was plenty for us.  It was cooked to perfection.  We had scalloped potatoes and asparagus which we took home left overs.  They had one of our favorite wines from Chandon Domaine which I have not seen in a resturant before. They brought us out 2 small desserts: one on each end of plate with Happy Anniversary in the middle.  They took our picture with their camera and provided us with the picture.  Our waiter was superb along with the service.  The managers made sure we were happy by checking on us several times."
1,"This is my favorite steakhouse! Their appetizers, salad are well made and delicious. The steaks are cooked to exactly to the diner's request. Great place to begin night on the town in uptown Charlotte or celebrate an important event."
1,"Need no occasion, they make the day/night a special one! Absolute class from the minute your seated! Ambiance, staff and food were spectacular!  Angel our waitress was the best!!"
1,Excellent Health Care
1,"We had awesome box seats complete with some tasty snacks and beverages. While I don't claim to know much about Basketball ...(or anything really), I was able to still have a  great time. They had plenty of entertainment including a really awesome competitive teen cheer leading routine, children's choir,  and great jazz band. \n\nThe venue itself is very nice- and we even got to see Michael Jordan!"
1,"Savannah Red is such a hidden gem! I was pleased to know that the servers, and all of the managers are Certified Sommeliers!!! The wine list rocks with some great boutique-y selections as well as some standard types and at great prices. Everytime I want an intimate date restaurant that wont break the budget, I go here! Its quiet, gorgeous and the service, food, and atmosphere are always spectacular. Its good to see that true Southern Dining Rooms still exist!"
1,"Wow. Wonderful food and impeccable service. I will be coming back. \nFirst things first: kudzu butter, y'all. Kudzu butter. Amuse bouche of lamb bacon and Boursin cheese served on a crostini with cherry relish was a wonderful start. I went with the crab bisque and would pass on that next time. The ingredients used were obviously nice, but they were blended down to a frothy texture that wasn't appealing to me. My main course was the aged filet with the black garlic sauce. I decided to pair it with the grits and asparagus. Perfection. I've visited a nearby well known steakhouse recently and this was FAR better. The service was attentive, helpful and pleasant. I cannot wait to visit this place again. \n\nNote that this place does not offer takeout. The waitress mentioned they gets lots of calls."
1,"Gourmet Soul Food? I love it. Who would have thought such a nice little gem would be hidden inside the Charlotte Marriott. We had some very artistic chefs with us since we were all here for the Research Chefs Association's annual conference. No pressure to the chef since we didn't say anything until half way through the meals. They started us out with a complimentary smoked salmon torte. Some great appetizers, then a blood orange sorbet for palate cleansing. It was quite a culinary experience. The head chef came out since he was also a Johnson & Wales alum as were our guests. Great score and I highly recommend."
1,This hotel restaurant is fantastic. I will say with 100% confidence that this is the best breakfast that I have ever had. The omelet station is superb and the breakfast potatoes are full of flavor. They were very patient with my 3 children and were very helpful. I can't wait to stay here again.
1,"I enjoyed Cutters! \n\nNice decor; reminds me of a room George Vanderbilt would have at the Biltmore house for after dinner drinks and cigars. \nGood background jazz music!\nThere is a good selection of cigars and the service was great!\nI had an Absinthe cocktail. Absinthe is something I've only read about and seen on TV. I as curious about how it tasted.\nIt is a strong drink, with a licorice flavor.  It was good and it is something I may try again."
1,"\""A woman is a woman but a good cigar is always a smoke\""\n\nCutters is hands down the classiest cigar lounge I have been to.  From Australia to Singapore and London to NYC, the place can not be beat.\n\nSettle in to any of the leather nailhead wingback chairs and prepare to be pampered. The staff is awesome.  Alicia and Sam are the 2 longterm veterans and they will treat you right.  The drink prices are a bit to the high side, but you will never suffer the indignity of an empty glass, or the lack of a good story if either of them are there.\n\nThe cigar selection is reasonable; prices also a bit to the high side, but you are paying for a rare privilege of having a wonderful venue to chill out, enjoy a smoke, and NOT have a sports bar feel to the place.\n\nThe back room has a full size pool table (no charge!) where it is not uncommon to see an executive of one of the banks in town playing the role of 'shark'. The middle room feels like a library at a regally appointed home with a fireplace and more comfortable chairs and tables.\n\nAmong my favorite haunts.  Grab your favorite smoke, a liberally poured cocktail and let the days stress depart in the blue smoke of your cigar."
1,"Cigar lounge that truly deserves the name. Don't get fooled by by Marriott location. Great staff, great location and music (incl. billiard). Prices are fair and food can be ordered from the restaurant just opposite. Selection of whiskeys is standard. \n\nCigar selection appear to be ok though I cant say for sure as I stick to Cubans (you can bring your own for a surcharge). Smoked a Monte Open Eagle, ate a great filet mignon and enjoyed local beer. Perfect early Saturday evening after a long oversea flight.\n\nTotally recommendable."
1,"This is one of my favorite locations. It was 2011 since my last visit and Katie remembered me from previous visits, particularly how I rant about Atlanta!  There is more that I like about Charlotte, including this place! I digress.\n\nKatie and Jamie are great bartenders both of them made a good Tom Collins!"
1,Still five stars.  Had the opportunity to take chickie's son to his first game Sunday.  Awesome experience even though we were blown out by Tennessee.  Amazing to see how the fans act in Charlotte.  So much class and comraderie.  Go Panthers!!!!
1,"Norwood, Munnerlyn, Wharton - Go Gamecocks!  Go Panthers!"
1,"great team,"
1,"It's been a long time since 2003/2004 when the Panthers went to the Super Bowl.\n\nThe Cardiac Cat's made a huge move on 12/22/13 when they took down the Saints 17-13 to take control of the NFC South.\n\nWith 55 seconds remaining, Cam lead the Cats on a 65 yard scoring drive. Key receptions by Tedd Ginn & Greg Olsen leading to a clutch catch by Domenick Hixson for the go ahead score.\n\nThe most dramatic 55 seconds in sports I've seen at BofA stadium."
1,Great take out spot conveniently located in the Latta Arcade. Never takes more than 5 minutes to get my food even during the lunch rush. Pricing could be a dollar cheaper in my opinion but the bourbon chicken special is fantastic.
1,So far I like it.
1,Had a blast at Connolly's on Fifth.  Was in uptown for work and walked over to the bar with some co-workers.  We visited on a Tuesday and it had a nice size crowd for  a Tuesday night.  We went for a few drinks and ended up staying until the lights came on! Walked in and instantly felt at home.  Its a dark bar with typical Irish bar decor.  Bartenders were very friendly and easy to get their attention.  Great beer selection and everybody was super friendly. \nWill definetely be back.
1,Fastest year of my life! The growth panel is complete and we couldn't be happier. The last session was the most fun. Since our daughter has started experiencing separation anxiety I didn't think we'd get huge laughs and smiles. I was wrong. Jeff and Becky worked really well with her and helped direct me to get the best shots. They had great toys that she responded enthusiastically toward. \n\nWhen I returned for the proof appt it was difficult to pay attention because I had my daughter with me and she was all over the place. Becky walked with her to the next room where they had more toys and I listened to them play... she didn't cry (remember she's been having separation anxiety). She actually had a fun time. They were really nice and patient with us.
1,"It took me about a year of living in Charlotte before friends clued me in to this best kept secret.\n\nTHE BEST BURGER anyone has served me in Charlotte -- right here, unbelievably, among the wine store casks and the Lenox china displays. It's a lot more low key than the crazy food court upstairs. Killer BLTs that you can address at eye level. Great grilled chicken and salads for light days, plus a selection of hard to find treats like Goldenberg's Peanut Chews."
1,"Was in Charlotte for a couple days and heard this place was a must try. My boyfriend and I went and had an amazing time! I started off with the calamari and it was absolutely perfect - best I've had! My boyfriend had the Cajun crab and shrimp dip and fell in love - the portion was quite hearty. For dinner I had the almond crusted tilapia and he had the special pepper crusted ahi tuna. His tuna was perfectly cooked and the sticky rice was perfection. My tilapia was good but the mash potatoes, corn and asparagus definitely made up for it. Expect to pay a good amount of money - I had 2 mixed drinks and he had 3 for a total of $124. Next time I'm in Charlotte I'll definitely go back."
1,"As someone in their twenties, I seriously enjoyed coming here! It completely exceeded my expectations. This museum is a must when visiting Charlotte, especially if you have small children. It's a one of a kind place indeed."
1,"My name is Karen, and I'm not the biggest fan of science.  However, with that admission out of the way, I had an absolute blast at Discovery Place.  My boyfriend and I spent nearly 3 hours there on a Sunday afternoon - no children, just two 30-somethings - and enjoyed every moment.  The IMAX theater is awesome, and there are typically a few different movies to choose from.  Yes, this is an extra ticket/cost, but if there's something playing that interests you, it's definitely worth checking out.  The exhibits span a broad range of ages, and whether you're 3 or 33 (or older), you'll be educated and entertained.  The museum is multiple stories, and the cafeteria has options galore.  Hot or cold, healthy or cupcakes, you can find something to please even the pickiest of eaters.  There are two entrances (one on 6th Street, one on Tryon), and if the line is too crowded at one, I suggest checking out the other (when we were there, 40 people must have been waiting in line at 6th Street, but upstairs on Tryon was empty).  A great place for taking out-of-town visitors, a much needed activity for those with wee ones, or a laid-back weekend date, it's a great place to discover!"
1,The Discovery Place exceeded our expectations. We heard about this and decided to check it out on our way out of town. There is soo much to see that it's a little overwhelming. Our kids are on the younger side (5 and 3) and can't read yet so some of the science things they didn't get or understand. The staff is very helpful and willing to help you with the experiments. We loved the little kid area where we could put our baby down so she could explore too! Cafeteria and parking is over priced but the cost of admission is totally worth it. Be prepared to spend at least 4 hours wandering around. Great museum! We will be visiting again!
1,"This is a great place to take kids on a rainy day. My niece and nephew were visiting and everything with outdoor fun was closed due to the thunderstorms - so we went to brunch and then hit this place.\n\nThey had a ball and learned a lot too. The Frog and Alien exhibits were open when we were there and they really liked those.\n\nMake sure you go too all the different levels because there are many little hidden spots. \n\nKids may not want to sit still for the IMAX movies, so if you book that, you may want to let them play themselves out before going to it or go to that first before you make them aware of everything else they can do.\n\nDon't miss the World Alive room - the kids loved looking at everything under a microscope and the Kids Science play room was really cute and a lot of fun for smaller kids.\n\nI would say this place is best for kids 7 and under."
1,"SCIENCE ON THE ROCKS!  What a great idea.  Friday nights once a month, cash bars, 21+ crowd - everyone unleash your inner nerd!\n\nI went to the 90's night in August, but apparently each night is themed.  Tickets are $8-$10 and you get to experience all of the awesome exhibits that the science education center has to offer.  Things are just as fun as they were when you were a kid - just now, you don't have to deal with the kids!"
1,"Needed to burn a few hours & decided to check out Discovery Place. It seemed like my hubs & I were the only adults without children there. When in Rome.... We had a blast with all the kids. December is nutrition month. I really like the fat to muscle displays. There was a ton to do & I could have spent several more hours playing in all the exhibits. I loved how hands on the exhibits are for everyone. I also loved that some of the \""apprentices\"" are kids. Fantastic learning experience for them. Because I am a biologist, I have a few things I would like to see, but I have no negative comments. Good job Discovery Place."
1,"This place had everything a sammich lover needed. A straightforward, simple menu, friendly people, and a little reading material for when you go stag. \n\nIt looks like from the other reviews, that I am not the only one who gravitates towards the Italian wherever I go. Here was no exception and it was really good, convenient, and reasonable. I got just the sub and it was $4.15. \n\nI'm not going to say I don't like elaborate, descriptor-laden sandwiches, but sometimes you just need your classic build and that's exactly what you find at Sub One."
1,Best sandwich in town...New Jersey all the way
1,"Stayed here a few months ago and still remember the great service I received. One night, there was a knock on my door asking if I wanted turndown service. I said no thank you but I would like one of the chocolates they put on pillows. The employee said he didn't have any and said good night. Ten minutes later, there's another knock on the door and room service produced a plate of chocolate covered pretzels free of charge. How's that for service? I don't normally stay at Omnis but this one went above and beyond bringing this weary traveler chocolate after a quick comment about how much I love chocolate. Will definitely stay here again if I return to Charlotte."
1,We had our company holiday party here and it was an AMAZING time!  Great atmosphere and all of the catering staff were courteous and helpful.
1,"Terrific lunch spot!  Their cubano sandwiches are excellent...and always go with the fries...skinny, perfectly made fries.  Their Mojitos and Caipirinhas are the very best in town...dinner seemed a bit overpriced, but the food is still excellent.  The other nice part of Latorres is that its in the heart of downtown, so plan a nice dinner or happy hour before heading out to hit some more classic bars, pubs or clubs in Charlotte."
1,"The food is good, but to me, the desserts are what really make Latorre's special. They do this crazy thing with burned sugar that is magical.\n\nThey have great lunch specials. It's a little pricey for just me, but it's just right for a business lunch with a client. It makes you look smart and sassy and quirky and fun.\n\nThere's lots of vegetarian options, which is always a good thing. \n\nEverything is presented beautifully, which is always fun. Some of the food seems almost too pretty to eat. \n\nSalsa night is also a good time. The crowd is relaxed and willing to teach a dorky newbie like myself. \n\nI've honestly never had a bad time here, night or day. Charlotte needs more places with so much character."
1,"Just went to Don's the other day to get my tennis racket re-strung.  The store was pretty busy (right after work - 5ish), but Don somehow was still able to provide personal service as he always does.\n\nYou pretty much can get everything Tennis in this store, and if Don doesn't have it, he will most likely order it for you if you want to wait for it.\n\nYou can either drop your rackets off and come back later to pick them up - most of the time I only have one to string and I just wait for it while browsing at the new products, maybe hitting some with the makeshift  hitting cage that Don has in the back of the store.\n\nDon is pretty old school so no credit/debit cards... just cash or check.  I always make sure I make a pit stop at the ATM before I go and see Don."
1,"I've bought shoes, a sweet 3-compartment insulated Head bag, grip, and had my rackets restrung there several times. Always satisfied by their professionalism, speed, and courtesy. There's no shoddy salesman tactics, no unkept promises about restringing (done same day or next), and I always leave happy.\n\nI highly recommend Don's to all tennis players, new and experienced.\n\nThanks Don's"
1,"You wouldn't think there'd be much to say about a key shop, especially one so small, but this place is fantastic!\n\nFirst, the location is key.  It's in its own little tidy shack in the parking lot at the Park Road shopping center, right outside of Blackhawk hardware.\n\nWhen you peek in behind the counter, you'll see an immaculately kept workspace and rack after rack of keys and accessories.  The guy who runs the place usually has some good music going, and when you tell him what you need, he goes to his manual key grinder and gets the job done in no time at all.  \n\nThe prices are reasonable, and the attention to quality is top notch.\n\nI'll tell you why it's worth going here rather than somewhere else like Lowes or Home Depot. Most places these days seem to use those automatic key making machines, where the unskilled attendant plugs in your key, then the blank, then pushes a button and lets the robot do the rest.  These machines put out garbage, and you're as likely as not going to have to come back and get the key redone.  And maybe again after that.\n\nGo to Park Road and let a human cut your key right the first time."
1,"I love this little bookstore.  One of the few remaining independents in Charlotte.  Although the selection is limited (compared with Borders, etc.), the friendly and helpful staff will order and hold any book, and can usually get books in one or two days.  Moreover, it's a well-picked selection that seems to always have what I am looking for.  I have found that emailing this bookstore and having them hold books works more quickly and is generally easier than using Amazon.  Nice browsing selection if you don't know what you want, and the staff can be very helpful with recommendations if you tell them what else you like.  The location, in Park Road Shopping Center, near the corner of Park and Woodlawn, is convenient to virtually everywhere in the city."
1,"We purchased our wedding bands from the Park road location. The service was excellent helping us find exactly what we were looking for. When no wedding band matched exactly, we had ours custom made and they came out even better than expected. They were up front about the timing and what they would do to make the molding etc. I enjoyed my experience with brownlee jewelers and the staff. I will go back for my next jewelery purchase."
1,Great service.  Total transaction took about 15mins. Got $722 for five pcs of old jewelry. I almost fell out when Michelle told me the amount. Lol
1,"Kevin was excellent- diagnosed the problem quickly, part came fast- called & came on time. Very happy with service & would highly recommend."
1,"I have a confession to make and it won't be pretty... Ok, are you ready? Sigh... My name is Beth F. and I have a problem... but they say the first step to fixing that problem is to admit it right?? Well forget that, I don't want to help this problem!! I think I could literally drink Sonny's sweet bbq sauce. \nIt is so freaking amazing I think we could start a world peace movement with that sweet creamy deliciousness. I would say to give me a few buckets of it, to start the movement, but I think my will power would cave and I'd end up consuming it all before I could even get it to the places it needed to go. \nThe service at this location has always been fantastic and fast, and my God, it goes without saying that their bbq is the best I've ever had. My only complaint about Sonny's is that it's not walking distance to my house. We had one nearby that closed I guess, and so I'm just bummed and it's making me whiney. :P \nThey have a salad bar, but let's be honest... who eats the salad bar when the BBQ plates are so filling... NOM... If you're hungry NOW, and want something that you will most likely have leftovers from, this is your place."
1,"I ordered the Sonny's Sampler, and omg. I had absolutely no complaints. Such delicious food with tons of flavor! Pulled pork is by far my favorite! Going back tonight for dessert!"
1,I haven't been to Carowinds in years.  We went once as a family day trip and a few times in school.  My favorite part was the guess your mph pitch game.  We couldn't care less if we won a prize (we never did) we just wanted to see how fast we could throw.  I guess around twelve yrs old we threw in the forty mph range.  AND WE FELT LIKE GODS.  Right next door was the ice cream sundae stand where you could get your dessert in a mini baseball batting hemet.  I still have all those helmets.  O there were the rides.  Back then the Carolina Cyclone was the new coaster with a loop and two corkscrews.  White lightening was a simple one loop and up a hill and then again backwards.  I always liked the swings.  Maybe because it was beside the ice cream sundae stand.  They had Rip Roaring Rapids which was a little float going down a little river with water splashing everywhere.  And for some reason we waited 2 hours to ride this each time.  Im sure none of these rides exist anymore but back in the day it was great.  Me and chickie ended up living a couple of miles from Carowinds a few years ago but had no desire to visit.
1,this is one of the better theme parks.  it has some really great rides and is very family friendly.  it has the southern charm from all of its employees.  it is a fun place to stop and play for a few hour.  you can do almost everything in the park in half a day so it makes it nice if you have pass to go and just spend a few hours.  if you like theme parks this is one you need to go to.
1,"OMG!! Had A Blast! Scarowind is soo fun (However I don't get scare, it was still awesome!! The people who work there ( trying to scare people) were soo friendly and funny! Gotta say, I had the best night of my life with my friends ( and scarowind buddies XD) ! Obviously I went at 6pm and left at 12 am means it was awesome! So I can't wait for next year Scarowind! Love love this theme park!!!"
1,Awesome rides!!!!! Both children and adults rides were terrific! We went on a Friday and there were no lines! What more can you ask for?
1,"I've been coming to Carowinds for 18 years. I also worked there for 2 years. It's my baby, really. I should mention that there are greater ride options and there's more of a family feel now that Cedar Fair Entertainment Company has taken over. Food's yummy (and worth it). Park is very clean and tidy. Scarowinds is an attraction those 13+ won't want to miss. It's plain awesome. Go for the whole day!"
1,The new service manager Kenny was extremely polite and helpful in explaining options for my wife's vehicle. I've been coming to this location for over a decade and have always been pleased with the services received.
1,"Great place to work - a company that cares about its people. While most work is fast paced, they are challenges worth looking forward to every day."
1,The dealers are so knowledgeable and helpful! We always find some great stuff. We just recently purchased vintage blue glass BALL jars from the 1950's for a DIY project.
1,Dr. Wanda Robinson is one of my favorite people in the world:-) Never had a doctor that genuinely cares for her patients and is not afraid show it. I know she gets sick of me(proclaiming to be a dr in my own mind) self diagnosing myself by way of the internet.......please forgive me:-) The office is conveniently located uptown in the BB&T center and I've never had a problem getting in for a last minute appointment or if there is an emergency.
1,"I have been a member of GWV Y since it originally opened.  The staff is amazing, the location is amazing and the facility is one of the best maintained fitness centers in Charlotte.\n\nMy favorite classes are Kickboxing, Cycle, Athletic Conditioning and Zumba.  Note:  I recently started taking Zumba at GWVY and the sessions have been great.\n\nThe KB instructor is simply amazing.  The class and all of the participants are like a family.   The great thing about the Y also is that we often get together after a great class...and go to some of the best restaurants (see my reviews) in the downtown area.\n\nIn addition to the great facility, the GWV Y does amazing things for the community and offers great opportunities to volunteer!\n\nI highly recommend the GWV Y for total mind, body and spirit!!!\n\n****I miss my KB instructor but have really enjoyed taking the occasional Turbo Kick class.  The structure and queuing is different ...but can provide a good workout."
1,"I love the Gateway Village Y.  The staff are very friendly and do a great job keeping the facility clean.  Unlike some of the other Y's in the area, Gateway is typically not super crowded.  Its a great place to go to take group exercise classes.\n\nBe sure to look up the parking codes on their branch website so you can park in the parking lot right beside the Y after 4:30 each weeknight.  Otherwise you have to park in the parking deck up the street."
1,"Been meaning to write an update for the Dowd for the longest time, but today I got a little extra motivation to do it.  Not only has the Dowd provided a great place to work out, but it has given me some consistency (which is nice).  Yes, it tends to be crowded, but if you play around with the times you come in, I'm sure you can find a great time without having to fight the crowds.  For me, it's early in the morning.  The trade off of sleeping in, versus being miserable and waiting for machines is worth it to me and it is a great way to start the day!\n\nLocation, location, location!... I have recently been doing a lot of running and the Dowd provides a great starting place.  Run down Morehead.... (careful of the uphill coming back to the gym)  I've run up to Tryon and through downtown... but either route you take, its nice to come back to the gym... grab a couple minutes in the steam room... grab a shower and be on your way.\n\nThere's been a change in some of the spin instructors so I haven't been able to find a great combination of music/instructor, but I haven't been trying too hard.\n\nOh yeah!, the reason for my update.... I was leaving this morning after a brutal 3 mile run I decided to do in the dark, misty/rainy weather.... and I caught a glimpse of a sign. They must have just put it up for 2012, but it reads \""This is your year!\"" which is great motivation every time you leave the gym!  I am hoping 2012 will be MY year and the Dowd will help me (in the words of my favorite Star Trek Captain) \""Make it so\""...."
1,"5 stars come from my overall experience with gyms in the past and I personally love Dowd Y.  I just realize I haven't written about it.  Look, I am not a big exercise/workout person. And I remember years ago when I first thought about joining, this place intimidated the heck out of me.  Now that I have been a member for awhile, I highly appreciate what it has to offer:\n1. No annoying kids/teens.  Sorry if I offend some people, but it is hard enough for me to drag myself to workout. I don't want to be babysitting and/or have to listen to some teenage drama.  The general demographic here is young professional.  They have a kids room for the very little ones when the parents are using the Y, but overall no kids running around like the other Ys in the suburb.  \n2. Towel service. They have small towels for wiping sweat as well as bath towels for locker room usage.  Excellent perk!\n3. Great hours.  It opens until 10pm weekdays. It opens early but it doesn't affect me, I am not a morning person :)\n4. Great facilities.  It has so much to offer, from great group classes (at all hours), to pool, basketball court, indoor running track, racquet ball courts and the equipments.  My personal fav is the steam room and sauna. \n\nYes, the parking can be challenging but after a while you can figure out when and where is the best.  Membership can be expensive but they now offer tier membership fees based on income. If you don't make much, you can afford it still.  And the location is very central for people who work or live in town."
1,Great facility! Amazing staff! Dion assisted me and he was so professional! I will be joining this gym! So much to do there! I simply loved racket ball!
1,"Still favorite Y in area.  Convenient location, but parking can be a bear.\n\nLOTS of different workout programs available.  Friendly, professional and caring staff.\n\nDIG that they still provide towels.  \n\nGreat assortment of daily workout types, where seeing 80 year old mixing it up with Millennial Hipster is not unusual.\n\nFit or flabby, young or young at heart, come all and get healthy!"
1,"The atmosphere and the service made my evening with friends so much more pleasant that I will definitely be back. The food was good, the Mediterranean salad was amazing, that dressing was tasty and not overbearing, the orange chicken was well cooked but not as special as I hoped for, then again, I can't expect miracles from chicken. The desert (tres leches) was great, super sweet so not for everyone but tasty."
1,"I like Blue, not sure why I don't get here too often (the price may be a big weigher).\n\nLast time I was here is for a friend's birthday celebration. I ordered the sea bass and yum... I almost lick my plate if only my momma didn't teach me well. My companions got Moroccan chicken and some part of pig on a bone. Yes, they both are also yummy (I'm a forker and good at it!) \n\nBut definitely glad I didn't lick my plate because then I had room for dessert. They were nice enough to put all three desserts (chocolate moose, lemon bar and chocolate molten cake) on a beautiful plate with candle on it. We unanimously agreed, we will claw each other for the lemon bar. \n\nWaitress was really nice and attentive. So... definitely come and visit blue, get some wine and lemon bar while listening to jazz."
1,Great setting. Big restaurant but great service. Mediterranean. Halibut was killer - in a soup.  Major dipping action.  A gem!
1,"I've been to Blue twice to entertain clients for dinner and both times, the restaurant exceeded my expectations!  \n\nFirst, they are extremely accomodating to large groups and easy to make reservations with.  The staff is top notch with impeccable service and I was very pleased to see that they knew the extensive wine list and every detail of the menu to a tee, which should be a given at a restaurant of this caliber but I'm always surprised at how many places this doesn't hold true.  \n\nOnto the food, we started with the arancini (sp?) balls - YUM, they are a must have and our table enjoyed the calamari and scallops as well.  For dinner, several people at our table had the Wild Boar (two ways), which I got to taste, and it was amazing, definitely one of the best things on the menu.  I opted for the Duck Bolognese the first time and was not disappointed; the sauce, pasta, duck and even the fried egg on top were all cooked perfectly with flavors that blended exceptionally well.  During my most recent visit, I had the Lamb Tagine, which was not only spectacular in presentation but also in flavor.  It's a hefty portioncooked over cous cous with fruits and veggies - it was so tender is just slid off the bone.  To finish, all the desserts were great and I highly recommend Blue for just about anything - a date, business dinner, special occasion or just a drink at the bar.  Enjoy!"
1,"Had dinner at the bar and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  Colleen the bartender advised me on the meal and Mike the bartender talked soccer and hoops.  First they served me home baked bread with a delicious spread that was a meal by itself, then I had the poached pear gorgonzola salad which was light, tasty and satisfying.  Then Colleen advised the wild Boar.  What a treat!! delicious and came with a risotto that was amazing.  Topped off with a wild blueberry sauce.  Portion was huge and I could not finish it but I wish I could have.  I ended with the molten chocoloate cake with vanilla ice cream.  15 minutes to prepare Colleen had warned me, but 3 minutes to eat.  Super meal, wont forget it.  If you have a face and a mouth and can chew food, you will surely love Blue!!"
1,"i have been to blue about 4 times, i think, and i've never been disappointed. everything i've eaten here has been wonderful. hummus: delicious. red peppers stuffed with goat cheese: to die for. filet a la blue: done gone to heaven. \n\ni recently came here with a big party and we had a little room off to the side which was just us after the other tables finished up. every person there was pleased with their meals and almost everyone ordered something different. to start we got a couple of appetizer trays. we had calamari, arancini di riso (risotto balls), maybe some kind of fried ravioli or something else? i'm not sure. we had a lot of food. one person ordered the moroccan chicken, another the salmon, another the duo of wild boar, two of us had filet a la blue, there was another steak and another fish too. everything was perfectly presented. the waiter was friendly but not intrusive. he even hooked us up with a special event dessert platter. pumpkin cheesecake, lava cake, and something else. \n\nmy only complaint this time around was my \""extra dirty\"" martini was not really dirty at all. but they did me a solid and sent out a cup of olive juice so i could make it as dirty as i pleased. :) can't wait to go back again!"
1,"This might be my new favorite date spot in charlotte. We went on a Wednesday night and as expected, we didn't need reservations. The decor was on point, dimly lit (dark enough to be inviting, and bright enough to read the menu). Our server was very knowledgeable and had wonderful suggestions for wines, appetizers, salads, cheeses and entrees. \nFor the appetizer, try the arrancini (breadcrumb coated risotto balls filled with mozzerella and panccetta and fried) and the scallops are apparently incredible.\n\nThe cheese selection is in my opinion the best part of the menu, but my beef tenderloin ala blue was the clear winner of the night. I want to go back again just writing this review! My date tried the Pork Milanese with Heirloom Tomatoes, which was very tasty, but very rich. It defintely won points for creativity, but not for eatability (if that makes sense). He ended up not being able to eat most of it, but luckly for him, I was able to share my steak and risotto"
1,Delicious dinner of scallops and trout. The appetizer of calamari was fabulous and the service at the bar with Tommi as our server was perfect. Awaiting music.
1,Naomi is amazing!!! She is so patient and she can take a simple dress and accessorize to turn it  into a one of a kind creation. This is the only place in Charlotte I would recommend to get the gown of your dreams because I trust Naomi to help thru the process and not just trying to make a quick sale.
1,"I was traveling for work and stayed at the Hilton so figured I would check Fujo out. Great service and really delicious sushi! The prices were very reasonable and the portions were large. I got a spicy tuna roll (always good) and a volcano roll and they were so good. I also got a rainbow martini, which was yummy. I'll definitely go back when I travel to Charlotte."
1,"If you live uptown, this is the only place for serious Chinese and Japanese food that delivers. You have to beg sometimes, but they'll do it as long as you're not a crappy tipper. They have never forgotten anything in my order and come prepared with utensils, sauces, and napkins.  Closed Sunday's."
1,"I would highly recommend Foundation for the Carolinas for an uptown wedding in Charlotte, NC.  My husband and I got married there in August 2014. \n\nWe were able to comfortably use this space for our ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception for 107 guests.  The 4th floor space we used was newly renovated, and with good weather you can utilize the patio spaces, which have awesome views of the city, including the changing color Duke Energy building.  \n\nWe are starting to get back our professional photos and the venue photographed beautifully; it was the perfect backdrop, in fact we chose to do our sneak peak in the 1st floor gallery space.  \n\nWe really enjoyed working with the staff, Rebecca and David, and loved this venue's uptown location.  It is a block and a half from Holiday Inn Center City and across the street from The Dunhill.  It was very accessible for our out-of-town guests to stay uptown and walk to all of the weekend wedding celebrations.\n\nhttp://evergreenstudio1.com/blog/?p=3960"
1,"This is my new favorite place. Love love the jerk chicken and collard greens. The curry was really good too, and the cabbage. I had a taste of the salted fish, which I wasn't a fan of, mainly b/c it was fried, but the rice and peas, I enjoyed as well.\n\nHighly recommended hole in the wall for take-out foodies."
1,"Love 2001 Cleaners. I only have a few items that need to be dry cleaned, but these guys always do the job. \n\nPretty standard, really. Come in, drop off your stuff and come back next day to pick it up. Always done with a smile and you can't really go wrong. \n\nHere's a tip: Drop off your stuff on Wednesdays. 25% off and you can drop off anytime during the day. Pretty darn good deal.\n\nThese guys and gals are always friendly and helpful. Also, their seamstress is very nice. She fixed a pair of linen slacks that I have (Who says \""linen slacks in a Yelp review anyways?) and did a great job. \n\nGreat job, 2001. Keep truckin'."
1,"Wow... Talk about a great service and quality of work. I use these guys for all my dry cleaning and alteration services.  I would strongly recommend trying theses guys for your dry-cleaning needs. Guarantee you won't be dissatisfied......2001 team, keep up the great work!!!"
1,"This place is GREAT!  I had a suit and a dress that I needed dry cleaned, as well as fixing the buttons.  I was in the market for a place to dry clean, as I had not yet used this service in Charlotte.  This place is close to home and had good reviews, so I decided to try them.\n\nI spoke for quite a while to the gentleman working.  He told me that they do all their cleaning in-house (with the exception of some extraordinary stains), let me know when I could pick them up, and gave me approximate prices.  They have a bar code system in place to keep track of all the items you bring in.  If you drop your clothes off on a Wednesday, you get 25% off.  I thought their prices were reasonable; I had a three piece suit, dress, and the repairs for around $29.  They also have a lady in on Tuesdays and Thursdays who does alterations, and those prices seemed quite reasonable as well.\n\nYes, I may have been able to find somewhere a little cheaper to get my clothes dry cleaned.  Still, I greatly appreciated the service and explanations that I got from the employees working there.  When I drop my clothes off, I want to know that the people I leave them with are going to take care of what I brought.  I will be bringing my stuff here from now on."
1,Prepare for your mind to be blown. This is one of Charlotte's best secrets.\n\nIt is on N. Davidson in an industrial/sketch area. You walk into this STUNNING garden with plenty of art. It is a delight. You feel like you are transformed into a new place. I cannot recommend this place enough. It feels magical. There are little paths that you can walk to with privacy. There is a large area to be in with a big group. We went for a rehearsal dinner and it was breath taking. \n\nI highly recommend going here.
1,"This is a great laundromat! It was clean, the owner was actively keeping it clean. They owner was very friendly and helpful. The washers are newer and I feel like they actually got my clothes clean.\nThere is a starbucks nearby and you can get wifi from nearby businesses."
1,Super sweet owners. Husband has been using their dry cleaning services for his work clothes and they have a fast turn around and remember their customers which is a plus. I know this because the 1st time I took in my husband's clothes they remembered his name and what clothes were dropped off previously.\n\nWe didn't have a washer & dryer at one point so I brought in 3 loads of laundry but forgot the detergent. The owners were nice enough to load me some and helped me transfer my laundery from the W to the D. \n\nI had my 2 young kids and they were very kind to them too! \n\nIt's obvious that they are a mom & pop shop that truly care for their customers. \n\nWe've moved away from them 2 months ago but still go out of our way to go there.
1,"I unfortunately have not been able to make it to this fine establishment for any meal other than breakfast.  But let me tell you it was well worth dragging my tired butt out of bed and heading to my sucky job early so that I could swing by this place.\nThe employees are friendly and welcoming even at 7am, and they have the hot coffee ready to go.  I'm not usually a fan of the breakfast sandwiches with egg on them, but I gave one from this place a try and actually liked it.  They use really fresh stuff, and the eggs were nice and fluffy.  So it your in the mood for something fresh and good, check this place out."
1,"I agree with the other reviewers that this is a great shop not only for plants, seeds, and garden supplies, but also for sound advice.  The people who own and run this shop know our local soils and weather, and know what grows best.  For a recent transplant like me, their insight was invaluable.  They've also got a good selection of water features for your garden, and it's inspiring to wander around the back yard at Royal Gardens, just to get some good ideas."
1,Completely charming. A true respite from the busy city!! I found something for the gardener that has everything.
1,"We had an amazing time visiting this restaurant recently to celebrate my sister's birthday. Its hard to find something special for her because she eats gluten free. They exceeded our expectations with the amount of thought and effort they put into making the experience great for all of us, but most importantly my sister. They were very allergy friendly and went to great lengths to make it delicious for everyone. They had delicious gluten free bread, gluten free sauces, and gluten free desserts like brownies and cake. All were delicious!  Always excellent service as well. It's nice to go to a restaurant and be treated like royalty from the moment you arrive to when you leave!"
1,"We always hit The Melting Pot during Restuarant Week, because for $30 a person it truly is a smashing deal for a three-hour foodie experience.  Make sure you CALL the restaurant to make a reservation if you have more than 4 in your party because often times a party of 6 or more will allow you to get 2 burners at the table.  The menu during RW allows you to try the cheese fondue course (we really like the Spinach Artichoke dip one and the cheddar is really good too!), the salad (I LOVE the California--- delicious and fresh!), the main course (be sure you pay the $5 upgrade to try the mojo cooking style) which includes fresh seafood and beef cuts.... Along with this ravioli concoction that is truly incredible.  The main course comes with an array of sauces..... Green Goddess is my favorite, although our server suggested to try his favorite which is a blue cheese sauce and I LOVED it, especially with the pasta! The service is always divine and they talk you through your entire experience.  It ends with the piece de resistance..... The chocolate.  We opted for the Flaming Turtle and the Yin and Yang..... Amazing!!!!! I say if you've never \""fondued\"" before.... Definitely Do! :)"
1,If you are ever in town the ying yong is awesome. This is a very unique and excellent restaurant. I would highly recommend.
1,"I can't say enough about the mouth watering food here! The cheese, the salad, the main course, the dessert, the drinks, they are all on point. Last night we went to celebrate the New Year and Ted was our waiter, he was THE BEST! As soon as we finished one course, he brought us the next, never a wait in between and they were definitely packed. We asked for specifics and he definitely delivered with our requests and didn't have to be reminded. I definitely recommend this place and Ted."
1,"Had reservations for 6:30p for the 4 course restaurant week special. Arrived about 5 minutes early and were promptly seated. Our server, Shannon, was so fantastic throughout the course of the entire experience.  She explained things well without belaboring the points, offered valuable pointers, and anticipated our wants and needs before we had to ask.  Food was superb.  Spinach artichoke cheese fondue was really delicious.  We both had the seasonal strawberry caprese salad and the berries were perfectly right, mozzarella and Roma tomatoes perfect in proportion and texture, and white balsamic dressing gave great balance to flavor profile.  Entree meats were fillet, marinated sirloin, pork loin, chicken, shrimp, ahi tuna, salmon, and ravioli.  All were good but the absolute best part of the meal for me was the 6 doing sauces.  As a condiment junkie I was in total heaven.  I cooked mushrooms and stuffed them with the green goddess (which is sour cream, cream cheese, parsley, garlic, and maybe Shallots).  Server also recommended mixing the teriyaki glaze and curry together and my wife loved that.  Spicy cocktail was awesome on shrimp and gorgonzola was creamy and great on the beef.  My wife is all about dessert so she wanted the s'mores one...milk chocolate, marshmallow creme flambeed with graham crumbles. We added a swirl of peanut butter in it too and it was awesome. I liked doing the blondies and pineapple and she loved the bananas, strawberries, pound cake, brownies, oreo rolled marshmallows...she loved it all. 2.5 hours later we were ready to roll one another out.  Come here nearly famished as you will get enough food for a village. Wonderful experience."
1,You wont regret it
1,OMG!!!! Best place EVER!!! I go there every year for my birthday. I love how many they options that they have. Also the dessert is AMAZING!!!!!
1,"The Tina's are wonderful! Walk up from Elizabeth or Plaza Midwood and enter nail heaven. Best Pedicure and Massage I've had ( & I travel a LOT). Gellish paint is great for all types, but my short nails grow prettier with this special polish.  Tell Tina Missy Sent You!"
1,"I just moved to the area and was dreading the task of finding a new nail salon.  I loved my old salon and was very sad to leave, but then I stumbled across Spa and Nail and couldn't be happier.  I agree with the previous review from Nikki - they had me cracking up the entire time and I left with a huge smile on my face.  It was such a relaxing atmosphere even though it is a smaller space.  It's been almost a week since my mani and pedi and it's still going strong.  Unlike some places I've been where the polish starts chipping off after 2 days.  I highly recommend this nail salon and will definitely be going back!"
1,"Maybe it's time to pull out those old Tom Petty records, because naturally he is correct when he told us that The Waiting is the hardest part.\n\nNot too long after I posted that last update, I received a call - a call, mind you, not an email or a letter, but a call! - from a manager a Roby to explain that they had some shake-ups in their management structure.  What that meant is that though they had tried to make sure all customers were aware, and that calling the old manager was a bad idea, there were probably some people who slipped through the cracks.  Guess who one of those might have been?  (That's my comment there at the end.)\n\nAnyway, after we talked a bit, and I explained that everything was actually working, and we just needed a few tweaks (light housings that could handle insulation were installed vs housings that could not, that sort of thing), we actually scheduled an appointment and the technician spent the better part of a day fixing things up to get us back on track.\n\nSo not only are they checking up to make sure customers are happy by reading places like Yelp, but they followed up and corrected the problem, in a much shorter time than the initial issue, and now we're moving along again.  And I don't have to look for another electrician.  Sweet."
1,"Absolutely the best breakfast biscuits in town! This place is a Charlotte staple! Also try the party pack for larger catering needs, Danny the owner is world class he will take great care of you! The folks here take a lot of pride in giving great service and quality food! Eat here once and you will be back!"
1,I have been going to Palestra to see Sharon for a long time. The spa is extremely relaxing and welcoming. Sharon always does a excellent job. I always look forward to my next appointment. I  look and feel wonderful every time I leave. They are the best.
1,"I usually prefer body wraps to massages, but Melanie made me forget wraps even exist! She gave me such a wonderful hot stone massage and was extremely considerate of my preferences throughout - staying warm, making the experience relaxing while still relieving tension, and creating a calm, peaceful environment. She wasn't the least bit pushy and I left feeling more relaxed than I have in years. All around, it's everything I want in a day at the spa and I can't wait to go back!"
1,"YES!!!!  Mama catered my wedding and it was perfect.  If you want to die and go to heaven, order the penne ala vodka or the pollo CarcCiofFi.  It can get crowded, but if you want a fun meal - sit at the pizza oven and watch the pizza maker do her (or his) stuff!  Can't say enough good things, my mouth is watering already.  Great for any special occasion or just a night out."
1,Delicious!! I heard so many good things about this restaurant and finally tried it! Now it is one of my favorites in Charlotte. Their pork ribs are outstanding and I now crave the goat cheese and mascarpone appetizer. The portions were huge. My boyfriend and I splitt the pork ribs and we were both stuffed. Everything I've tried at Mama Ricotta's has been fabulous!
1,"I have been meaning to eat here for a while, based on friends and other Yelpers. Boy am I glad I finally did. \n\nTook an out of town friend here for lunch Saturday. Sat outside as it was a beautiful day. Early on in the lunch of waiter, \""Derrick\"", accidentally knocked a glass of water on my friends lap. Us being pretty laid back, no big deal. Well Derrick took it very seriously apologizing multiple times, gave us a free goat cheese app, which was as good as it was unexpected. And then proceeded to tell us a story about how he dumped a glass of wine on a guys head early on in his waiting experience. He turned a potential disaster lunch, into one of the best I have had.\n\nNow onto the food, all around incredible!! Goat cheese app, fantastic. I got braised beef veg, soup, it was excellent. Had the pasta of the day which was grouper and salmon over spaghetti in a diablo sauce. Also very good. \""Mamas pasta\"" with pesto went over very well with my friend. \n\nI can't wait to get back and try the \""New Haven\"" style pizza, as I grew up in New Haven, and am VERY picky about my pizza!!"
1,"So fine...so good...every time with everything.\n\nI broke my habit by not ordering the wonderlishous lasagne and opted for the vodka penne.  Superb.  Wife had a special:  tubes with a short rib ragu which was extraordinary and very rich.  \n\nYes, we were stuffed so left with two cartons that WE WILL CONSUME FOR BREAKFAST tomorrow.   Haaaa, haaaa, ha.\n\nBen gave us a sense of humor with his excellent service, so typical of Mama's.\n\nIf you haven't been, go.  And go early for any meal as it is popular and gets pretty busy fast.\n\nYumalishous to the max."
1,"Queen's Feast Friday night.  As usual delicious food. And a knowledgeable and personable server, Daniel.  Have been going here for many years and always enjoy the experience. Food is fresh and Italian (not wanna-be) I know that because I am too."
1,"Seriously, Mama Ricotta's \""had me\"" when they brought the bread to the table. I am in love with it. Soft, warm and it looks like they brush it w/ a little butter and herbs/garlic. Do I sound obsessed? Hope not...Anyway, a few dishes I have tried include:\nPenne Alla Vodka\nLasagna\nBoth these pasta dishes are pretty good. I love them both but every once in a blue moon they can be a little off (dry, salty, etc)\nCarrot Cake Cheesecake (for dessert I usually share and pick a bite or two and am over it, that's just me though. For my few bites, I liked it. It could have been a little more room temp, felt like it was pre sliced and taken out the fridge to our table but overall it was good. I liked the combo and it was huge--a must share dish. \n\nLove their sweet tea too!\n\nOh and the last time I went I had the BEST server. His name sounded like Lavender but I know it wasn't Lavender. He was friendly, patient and attentive--to the point that he was already filling my glass of sweet tea as soon as I finished my last sip."
1,Had the pasta special last night at Mama's and it was unreal.  Pure breast meat chicken bolognese in a tomato sauce with perfectly cooked rigatoni. Chef Drew hits another home run.
1,My husband and I tried this place a few weeks ago and absolutely loved it! The warm goat cheese appetizer is to DIE for! My husband ordered the pizza with in house made chicken sausage and was in love! I had the cheese ravioli and it was delicious. We will definitely be going back. Great service and atmosphere.
1,"Everything was wonderful.  Had my birthday dinner here, party of 20. The staff were accommodating,  Mark was attentive and the food.. yum.com. Love dining here!"
1,This place is always spot on. The wine selection is always excellent and the food makes you close your eyes and say wow!  Great for any occasion and really fun for a special occasion. Desserts...gotta safe room or just do it anyway.
1,"I don't say this lightly, and I'm surprised I'm saying this at all.\n\nThis is actually the best Italian food I had EVER (and that counts Italy as well). It was hearty, flavorful and the service was simply fantastic. It tasted like they made quite a few things on site too.\n\nThe menu was also manageable (unlike some Italian places). My favorite is how you can order items family style. Everything was delicious through and through from the appetizers (goat cheese is a plus) to the cannoli. \n\nThe drinks specials were also delicious (I came when Mama-citas were the special)."
1,"Entering Visart Video is like what I would imagine walking into Netflix would look like. The selection is ridiculous, varied and endless. Visart put's Blockbuster to shame."
1,"If I'm not heading out on the town Friday or Saturday night, you'll most likely find me at Visart.  It's a very nostalgic place, reminding me of of my childhood.  Browsing the different genres, checking the ratings... I'm allowed to get the R rated movies this time!\n\nIt might be a buck or two more than redbox, but being able to browse the selection and rent pretty much any movie you can think of is simply awesome!  This is the only movie store I know of as well as the coolest movie store I've ever experienced."
1,"Occasionally you can hear people in our town talking about how we need to support the arts. If that's your cause, this should be one of the first places to support.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* Any budding filmaker in Charlotte needs to see the Criterion Collection movies from Visart. You can't get the included commentary anywhere else without buying the movies.\n*  TV series are a bargain. You can subscribe to Showtime if you want to see Dexter or you can just rent the seasons from Visart whenever you feel like it. \n* There is a place for mindless popular movies. Just as there is a place for women reading trashy romance novels. But there is a huge difference between popular movies and film. Visart has popular movies but can also can teach you about film.  \n* It's an experience to go into an independent movie rental store. Visart is no exception.\n\nThe only downside is that if you live far away if can be tough to get the movies back sometimes. But whenever that happens I look at it as a donation to one of my favorite local businesses in Charlotte."
1,"I was thinking about a particular camera, and Edward walked me through every feature of that camera as well as the highlights of similar models.  He also told me to come back in a week with all my questions.  Biggs is not only a retailer, but they give crash courses in photography for novices like me!"
1,"HANDS DOWN favorite place to get a sub! Meat, cheese, and other ingredients always fresh and tasty; I love the sweet tea; and every time I come here the staff is always nice. No complaints!\n\nUPDATE: They're called Sandwich Max now...and I havent had a chance to go back since they've changed the name, so a follow up will come after that!"
1,Great Subs!
1,"Best venue in town to see a show.  Over the years, I've seen Galactic, Medeski Martin & Wood, Soulive, Victor Wooten, and many others.  Can get a bit tight, but that's the price you have to pay to see live music in Charlotte."
1,"Seriously the best UPS store in town. I'm not one to send a package every day, every week, or even every month, but I've loved this location and the staff each time. \n\nCompared to other UPS stores, it's not all that different. Ship your stuff, box your stuff, buy a P.O box, etc.\n\nThe thing that sets it apart is the customer service. Each of the guys that work here are fantastic. It's not that much to shake a stick at, but their great at what they do and they're rather kind. Andrew, namely, is the guy that has taken care of our needs each time we've come in. Great guy and always helpful, patient, and kind."
1,"This review is for the maternity ward specifically.\n\nI have had 2 children here and it was such an awesome experience both times.  Dr. Morris is the best OB/GYN, hands down.  He delivered our first daughter and even when he wasn't able to deliver our second, he made sure we were comfortable with the other doctor on staff that night (she was also from his practice, Providence Women's Care).\n\nEvery nurse we encountered in labor and delivery, the aftercare maternity ward, and the nursery was just amazing.  They even have lactation consultants that come through after you have your baby to answer any questions and to make sure breastfeeding is going well.\n\nThe hospital food is much better than most and they offer a lot of different options.\n\nThe labor and delivery rooms and the post birth rooms are so great.  They have everything you need which is very helpful if you forgot something in your rush to the hospital.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this hospital and Novant Health as a whole."
1,"The lunch buffet is really great, everything is fresh and full of interesting flavor - nothing is spicy hot, though. Friendly staff."
1,"I eat Indian weekly and from all over NC and SC. I find Maharani to be the best in Charlotte. Their  buffet quality is outstanding. I have eaten here for years.  I have not been to Saffron, but the one in Greenville SC is my overall favorite."
1,"Each time I've eaten here, I've been pleased with the food.  The Beef Rendang is wonderful--the lemon grass flavor is prominent and the pepper is just right--not overpowering.  You'll want to start off with the Roti Canai appetizer, which is great--just don't dribble the curry sauce on your tie, 'cause it ain't coming out.  The peanut butter pancake dessert thingie is fun, too.  The Mango Chicken is aromatic and tasty, but I prefer their Rendang to anything else.  I think they do a fine job with the sushi and rolls as well.  I'm looking forward to trying other items here.  If you're not sure about this place, try it.  I think you'll like it."
1,"YUMMM...This place has delicious food and good service.  My favs are the Curry Lakhsa, Mee Goreng, and Tom Yum soup.  It's gotten to the point where my addiction is obvious.  I literally eat here once a week now and if I don't they get worried about me.  The other great thing is that if you want to change up your order (like add more veggies to the sesame tofu, also delicious) no problem!"
1,"I cannot get enough of this place. \n\nFood: Fresh, Delicious, Diverse\nAtmosphere: Comfortable, Classy but Casual, Well-Organized\nService: Amazing, Friendly, Quick\n\nMy boyfriend, roommates, and I come to Malaya almost once a week. The menu is not overpriced, the staff is beyond friendly and recognizes regulars, the food is spectacular, and you can't beat the atmosphere. \n\nThe sushi is always fresh, warm, and has that special something to each roll. I turned a sushi-hating friend into a sushi-craving friend simply by taking her to Malaya and letting her pick the first sushi roll she spotted. The meals always come quick, the portions are generous (I need a to-go box every time,) and the menu is diverse enough to satisfy everyone at the table. The Miso Soup is the best I've ever had. The house Plum Wine is delicious, that perfect balance of sweetness and tang, we can rarely get away without taking a bottle home. The tables are set far enough apart that you have complete privacy during your meal, but there is more than enough seating to accommodate a huge crowd. The staff is ridiculously friendly, promt, and thorough. \n\nOne of my absolute favorite restaurants in Charlotte. Hands down."
1,Try the Stingray! So delicious. Great service too.
1,Love this place. Great sushi. Great service.
1,"We are regulars here, we frequent once every week or two weeks - we come for the food. We dine in, we take out and we have delivered. Though, a few times in the last few months, they have said no to deliveries and have offered a discount on take-out to compensate, we don't mind it - we go to pick it up if they are not able to deliver it that day. Service is always friendly and attentive. The location is a good sized restaurant but I have never seen it more than half full on a given night. It does get pretty packed during lunch rush though.\nI cannot seem to stray away from the Char Kway Teow, I get it with just veggies and egg (the tofu comes fried, which I'm not a fan of anywhere). This dish always hits the spot, always consistent. We have taken friends, both local and visiting, and have ordered a variety of dishes (his favorites: Chili Chicken and Golden Tasty Shrimp). The only dishes we stay away from are the mango/orange dishes after we ordered it once and realized we did not like it that sweet, so I cannot review those but I have enjoyed every other dish we have tried in the three years we have eaten here. \nWe have limited experience with sushi here (mainly due to my inability to NOT order the Char Kway Teow every time).  We have tried the basic rolls (spicy salmon, spicy tuna, and California roll) and those were pretty 'normal'. Nothing negative to say about those. The sushi bar is always manned and looks clean from what we could see.\nThis will always be one of our go to spots, especially when we don't have an answer to \""What do you want to eat? I don't know, what do YOU want to eat?\"""
1,"I had the Roti Canai, similar to what I've had.  The pancake was softer not as flakey as it is here but still delicious.  Every place makes it slightly different.  The curry dipping sauce makes this appetizer the bomb.  It has a nice light curry flavor to it.  I highly recommend it.\n\nI also ordered the hainese chicken, I believed the chicken is boiled.  They provide three different types of sauces; soy sauce, red peppery sauce and a garlic type sauce. I tried each one with the chicken and it was also very yummy.  Be brave and give it a shot.  I must warn you that the chicken is not deboned so be prepared for a little bit of work.\n\nLunch was so delicious that I decided to return for dinner."
1,"Love this place.  This place served Thai, Malaya and some Vietnamese food here. My favorite for appetizer is the Indian pan cake (roti canai). Service a little slow but the food are great so it makes me forget about services HA. Enjoy!!!"
1,"I'd just about given up finding really good Asian food in the Charlotte area. When all the Chinese restaurants smell, look, and their food all tastes the exact same and doused in MSG, you get a little discouraged.\n\nI got enveloped and brought here in a party of 30+ people, so I have no idea what dishes were ordered, but I do know that service was excellent and the food was all delicious. Hey each dish had a different taste! You could distinguish chicken from pork in one dish from another. It was amazing. It's as if the cooks here don't use the same sauce ingredients over and over. Concept!\n\nSarcasm aside, this place is really great. Most of the dishes tasted very Chinese to me, so I'm not sure it's very Malaysian. Regardless, it was all delicious.\n\nI will definitely be back to try the sushi and some of the other dishes."
1,"I've been going to the Yoga Center for years even though I still go to other studios.   Phyliss is the only Iyengar certified teacher in Charlotte and is a true gem of a teacher.  If you want to learn about yoga or are just starting out this is a great place to start your practice.  If you are experienced or prefer another style of yoga, you can still benefit from classes here as you will get alot of teacher direction and attention and specifics about the poses.   Everyone should try a class here!"
1,"I will never be able to say enough about Elizabeth and the staff at La Tea Da's. They are beyond amazing! They catered our wedding reception and I have never heard so many compliments about food from guests at a wedding!! They also created a signature drink that was a huge hit and went above and beyond to make sure me, my husband, and our guests were enjoying ourselves. Elizabeth is a dream come true. She helped me from the initial stages of wedding planning and served as my day of coordinator. She is truly outstanding at her job!! We LOVE them and will be recommending them to all of our friends!!"
1,"The store is a wall to wall display of the latest comics and graphic novel releases.  They also have a selection of character figurines and memorabilia.  Parking in the lot next to it is easy and they have a bike rack out front.  This is probably one of the nicest comic book shops I've ever been in.\n\nThese guys also organize the annual Heroes Convention in June which is a cornucopia of comic books, manga/anime, movies and so much more."
1,"There is every kind of comic book genre imaginable in this place.  Including the entire Akira series, which is amazing.  The staff is helpful, funny, and really into geek stuff.  It isn't hard for a collector to drop a hundred dollars in just one visit, because there are so many gems here.  The establishment is well organized, and I will most likely come back."
1,"My husband, who is a huge comic book geek, loves this place. He always brings his out of state friends to it. I have only heard good things about it- and from very particular comic book geeks. It has a great vibe."
1,"Just getting back into reading comics again and it has been an easy transition with this store in town. It's a very polished up comic book shop and I love it! \nHave yet to go into the store and not gotten into a good discussion about anything from NPR, the Walking Dead to Edward Abbey. So, yah I've never been ignored here. To boot they always are really cool with my niece's rolling into their store. Most comic books stores cringe at the idea of 4 yr olds coming in looking through the comics. \nIf you like fun, you'll like Heroes!"
1,"This is a Great Place!  Great Escape!  Frank Miller's: Sin City, Dark Knight, Daredevil, 300 and Hard Boiled!  Graphic Novels, Comics and a great staff, who are always friendly and willing to give me an education!"
1,"About a year ago I got back into comic books.  I haven't read many since I was a kid but I've still followed many storylines and happenings.  When I decided I wanted to give it a go again, I remembered this place from when I was a kid.  Now, I come back every week (sometimes a couple times a week) to pick up the new issue of whatever I'm reading at the time and maybe pick up some back issues.  They have a great selection out on the floor and there's a good possibility that if you're looking for something that you don't see, they'll have it in their archives.  Great place to hang out and meet some other comic fans.  Great place to get advice on what's a good new read.  Great place to make new friends."
1,Great shop. Very open layout and friendly staff. Sometimes parking can be difficult though as it is a small shared lot.
1,This is a great comic shop. It is family friendly and usually has some kind of event going on every so many months. They are very loyal to their customers and provide a wide variety of comics to choose from. If you have any questions they're happy to help and if you're looking for suggestions they usually have a good one! The only drawback is the parking; because of it's popularity it gets a little crowded.
1,"Walid did a great job tailoring a custom Brooks Brothers jacket (retail $800+) that I found at the factory story ($40).  For $40, he took in the Portly 44 and turned it into a 42 Regular. \n\nHe was quick to point out the working button holes and equally quick to tell me NOT to tailor another jacket.  He could have taken my money but he was honest and said the jacket didn't need tailoring.\n\nHe helped me understand his work and also took the time to explain how he completed the tapering, so that I would know which sizes and fits would best be altered.  This saved me a lot of money, as the factory store does not accept returns.\n\nI currently live in DC and I still get my tailoring done here while I'm in town.\n\nIn contrast, I paid a bit less at an Asian tailor that shall remain nameless down Park Road, but found that my pants still did not fit after tailoring."
1,"Wali is a master tailor and does fantastic work altering jackets, pants ... you name it, he can do it.  He is attentive and really listens to what the customer wants done.  He takes pride in his work and makes sure the customer is satisfied with the piece before leaving the shop."
1,"After a visit to another tailor had me fearing for the fate of my gala gown, Walid restored my faith in humanity. \n\nOk, that might be a bit dramatic, but you don't  mess with a girl's fancy dress. Or at least don't shake her confidence in your ability to alter without issue.\n\nThankfully, Walid was simply amazing and lived up to the reputation that preceded him: Professional, polished and honest.\n\nMy dress was altered beautifully (I won't have to wear a bra, and I am not lacking in the chest department). \n\nThe service and workmanship at Myers Park Tailors is a wonderful example of getting what you pay for: perfection."
1,"I drove past this gem of a stop about 3 times until I finally found it!  It's tucked in the back of King's Court Shopping Plaza off Kings Dr.  When I got there I told Wally that I had read great reviews about his tailoring skills and he proved me right!  I brought him 4 dress that I've had for years and I wanted to alter them.  He gave me the best suggestions for each one of my dresses after really listening to what I wanted.  I loved his customer service skills so much that I had my husband bring his shirts in two days after I went to see Wally!  Life is great when you have found a fantastic tailor!  Note, you get a discount if you pay cash/check but he does accept credit cards."
1,"Walid is AMAZING!!!  On a Saturday night a week before my best friends wedding I tried on my bridesmaid dress and it was too tight in the chest area.  Although it was wearable, I knew that I was not going to be able to fully enjoy myself the way it was.  As it was late Saturday night and everything was closed on Sunday I wasn't going to be able to reach anyone till Monday and I was leaving for NY on Wednesday.  Finally after a lot of searching i found the website for Myers Park Tailors.  Their website had a email address so I immediately emailed them hoping that I would get a reply.  By early Sunday afternoon I had received an email from Walid who told me they were closed on Monday but bring my dress in on Tuesday and he would have it finished by end of the day Tuesday.  I was very nervous as he was my only hope, and he did not let me down!!  Tuesday morning I dropped off my dress and as promised Walid had it finished by the end of the day on Tuesday. I was expecting for the price to be a bit outrageous for a last minute emergency alteration but his price was completely reasonable and what I would expect to pay if he had a week to do the alteration!!!  I was finally able to breathe and enjoyed every moment of my best friends wedding!!!  I will only be using Walid for all of my future alteration needs!!"
1,"I have used Myers Park Tailors multiple times over the last few years and have always been very pleased. Most recently, they worked on the suit I'll be wearing for my wedding in a few weeks. It turned out great and my fiancee even said that I looked like a GQ model (God bless her)."
1,"I went here to get my prom dress altered. After trying it on, they advised me to just get a hook on the back above the zipper rather than taking it in the 1/2\"" because it was a one time wear and it would be very expensive to do so. The hook worked great! It fit tighter and my dress remained comfortable all night. I recommended all my friends to come here for alterations because they kept the customer in mind (a high school student with a minimum wage summer job). My hook was only $9 and I saved so much money going here opposed to somewhere else. \n\nAlso if you come here for a small alteration like I did, bring cash! They take cash only for purchases less than $27."
1,Good place! I chose this  place after reading the reviews online. I felt safe taking my suit into this place. Walid was professional and provided good customer service.\n\nI got my suit altered for an interview in just two days (granted I had only couple of minor alternations). But he delivered the suit a day before he promised. \nWhat I liked was I got a text message from these guys as soon as my suit was ready. \nPlace was busy but Walid still catered enough time to each customer.\n\nservices I got done: shortening pants and shortening sleeves (total $40)\n\nI'll definitely choose this place again.
1,Great food here. They are fast and give you a good portion of food. The general tso chicken is awesome!
1,Very good! Nice service and clean restaurant. Good food as well. Sesame chicken was great!
1,"Delicious burgers, reasonably priced!  The burger toppings are delicions and fresh - I love the \""build-it yourself\"" options.\n\nDon't miss the fantastic lemonade or orange-ade that is fresh squeezed when you order it!"
1,"My dad was a bouncer here in the 70's and my first visit was with the old man. I couldn't imagine any better venue in Charlotte. They even had a live band on Christmas night the last time I was in town. Can't say enough, so I'll leave it at that."
1,"No better place to listen to live music in Charlotte than the DDI...a historic and very intimate venue recognized as the \""Oldest Live Music Venue East of the Mississippi\"" and holds the title \""Oldest Blues Club In The U.S. Under Original Ownership\"".  Legendary performers like Eric Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaughn, Buddy Guy, Junior Brown, and  many others have graced their stage.  Amazing local talent too pretty much any night of the week.  Diverse and casual crowd.  And now that the place is completely smoke free, you won't leave smelling like an ashtray!!!  The Double Door Inn is definitely a hidden treasure in Charlotte.  Get out and support live music and the venues like this that offer it to you!!  You'll defnitely get your money's worth!"
1,"If you need a place for a company get together, this is it!  I was able to visit The Morehead Inn for a small company meeting of around 20 people and it was nice and cozy in the room they provided us with.\n\nWhen I first arrived, I noticed how it the plants were well kept and there wasn't that much parking.  If you come here, I would highly recommend carpooling.  From the parking lot, I was able to walk right to the conference room they had for us.  As soon as I walked in, I felt like I went back in time.  The decorations there were beautiful and made me feel like I had to drink tea with my pinky out.  The only gripe I have about their decorations was that they had plates with Slytherin colors.  How can they support the evil house in Harry Potter!?!?!  Other than that, everything was perfect.\n\nThey do not have that many bathrooms, but it is understandable since it is an old house.  I wouldn't want them to change that anyways.  I wasn't able to explore more in the Inn, but all the things I was able to see I loved.  The staff was also very friendly, so kudos to that!"
1,Gorgeous- immaculate historic estate- very spacious stay in the Mt Vernon room. Wonderful breakfast- great friendly staff!
1,"Best Chinese in town. Quick delivery, great service, great price."
1,"I've been ordering stuff from them since I moved here from San Francisco, CA.  Their Egg fu Young is unbeatable. I kept going back for more. They are fairly priced and the disposable containers the food came in, are sturdy.  You can tell they their hearts into packing your order. :) Your order comes with fortune cookies and lots of sauces. If you order in the early evening, service is speedy.  One time it was like 10 min and I live in the west outskirt of uptown"
1,"By far my favorite Chinese food!  Usually get take out from here--I love their fried dumplings and chicken and broccoli.  Convenient location across from CPCC's IT building.  Sometimes parking is kind of an issue during busy periods, but it's worth it."
1,"I discovered this place 2 yrs ago during 3 coures for 30.  Every time i go i have to have the either the Grilled grape salad, the grapes are rolled over the grill mmm. The goat cheese salad is mouth watering if you love cheese this is for you.  The goat cheese is light fried 3 medallions is normally what i have gotten on my salad. We always order the cheese/grape app which is wonderful. The fried chicken breast w/ spinach an gravy is my favorite.  Their pastry chef made my freind a chocolate cake for her birthday last year.  the service we always receive is more than wonderful."
1,"On a recent visit I had the duck which was tender enough to cut with a fork and extremely well flavored. The spinach and parmasean soup was out of this world! A fanastic find and very enjoyable atmoshpere. Resonably priced wine and good service make this a \""I'll be back\"" restaurant."
1,"WOW!  This has got to be the best experience I've had dining in Charlotte.  From the service, the food, the drinks everything was just perfect.   Carpe Diem has been bookmarked on my yelp for awhile now I'm so glad I finally checked it out.  I had some good friends in town who are also big foodies and I really wanted to impress them - kind of a risk taking them somewhere I've never been myself...but life's about taking risks right?  \n\nIt was 8:30ish on a Friday night and we had no trouble getting a table - when I walked in I was a little nervous that we were under-dressed and that the hostess might give us dirty looks but I was wrong...yes I think we were under-dressed but they treated us like queens.  Our server (I think her name was Shelly) was terrific she kept us entertained all night and gave us great suggestions for dinner.  We all started with some kick\n a_ _  dirty martini's seriously just ask to taste their olives they brine them and they are delicious.  Next up a fantastic cheese plate and Thai style carpaccio.  Carpaccio is one of my favorite dishes of all time I loved the way they prepared it here.  Next a fine bottle of Malbec and dinner time.\nWe all made good choices I don't know who's dish was the best I opted for the pork dish it's a new addition to the menu it was a German dish with red cabbage, breaded pork, spaetzle, and a sunny side up egg sounds weird but every part of the dish worked.   The shrimp cous cous and mushroom bolognese were very tasty as well.\n\nI can't wait to go back this is definitely number 1 on my list of restaurants in the Queen City."
1,"I made a reservation online though open table, something I thought we might need as it was restaurant week, although we weren't going for restaurant week. \n\nMy husband wanted to treat me to a date night, and had been raving over their fried chicken for almost a year when we decided we would go. \n\nAfter looking at the restaurant week menu, we thought we would just go with the entree because I'm not into salads, and we knew we would be too full for dessert. \n\nThe waitress brought out warm bread before we ordered, but the food came out so quickly we weren't able to finish the bread. \n\nWe both ordered the fried chicken with yukon gold mashed potatoes, black pepper gravy, and spinach. Not really being a big fan of spinach I asked for mine on the side. Surprisingly I did eat some of it when it came out, it was actually pretty good. For my taste I would have liked more salt, but they only have pepper on the table. \n\nThe fried chicken is boneless, a huge plus in my book. The gravy is also white gravy, and not brown gravy, which is also another plus. The mashed potatoes were great, some lumps but more smooth, perfect. \n\nOverall we had a great time. Once we sat down at our table we were out in 45 minutes, super fast, great service. \n\n**Just a note we had reservations for 5:30 but wanted to have a drink at the bar beforehand. They only open at 5, so we didn't have much time to sit. If ordering a drink, best to go with something simple like a liquor plus a mixer. Keeps the price down."
1,"We used Carpe Diem to cater our wedding, and it they were nothing short of outstanding.  Bonnie is amazing to work with - she is unbelievably creative with her cooking, and really helped us to get the exact experience we wanted.  Our guests all raved about how great the food was, which was really important to us as foodies.\n\nEvery time we've come here as diners, the experience is just as good.  The only time it wasn't to the nine's was during restaurant week, when (like most establishments) they are extremely rushed.  \n\nDefinitely give this place a try, it's 100% worth it."
1,"Beautiful interior, excellent service, divine food.  That is all that I really need to say.  However, there are mentionable aspects that set this restaurant apart from others.\nCarpe Diem is the quintessential date night restaurant.  It features romantic lighting, a carved ceiling and large paintings of flowers.  What could be sexier than that?  \nWe had reservations and were seated immediately.  There were several nice wine selections by the glass, and, although they were pricey, they gave you a darn good pour.  In fact, one glass each took us through dinner.\nWe were brought the most delicious bread with butter.  I rarely eat bread, but when I sampled theirs, I ate one and a half pieces.  Bad girl!\nI was pleased to see that they featured Anson Mills products on their menu.  And, even more delighted with the offerings of vegetarian and vegan selections. They even had a vegetarian special for the night.  How thoughtful!\nI did  order that vegetarian special.  It was a tart with a whole grain crust, covered with tomatoes, asparagus, cheese and a perfectly cooked over easy egg.  Phenomenal!  My date ordered the Anson Mills rice grits dish that featured their sea island red peas and Gouda cheese.  He chose the mushroom option instead of the shrimp.  Again, a stellar dish.  \nA five star rating seems skimpy with this kind of quality.  I rate them an entire solar system!"
1,"Recently took my fianc\u00e9 here for our anniversary. She is always skeptical about spending the money for a nice meal, but this changed her mind completely. She had a kale salad with grilled chicken and was blown away. I told them about the occasion when I made the reservation, and when we arrived they had put confetti on the table which was a nice touch, and the server immediately congratulated is upon greeting, little things like that go a long way with me.\n\nI had the grilled quail with a butternut squash pur\u00e9e, and for dessert we shared a toffee cheesecake. This was one of the best meals I've had in recent memory, and after a couple glasses of wine, two entrees, dessert, and tip, the bill was only about 80 dollars, and I promise it was worth every penny. Will DEFINITELY be returning here"
1,"Beautiful!  Romantic!  GREAT Service!  Fantastic FOOD!  Impress a Date or Client!  Funny, I have Never taken a Date here yet!  So it is a nice place to take a MaleFriend and have a quiet Dinner!  Not as Pricey as you would think for the Total Experience!\n\nBeef is usually what I want here and I have tasted many of the other dishes my Friends have ordered... Entrees are Meals (not a la carte) and a VALUE for the Quality! Potato (dish) many different ones, sometimes a Potato Pasta... One time we got here so early (5:00 PM) the Chef had not decided what he was going to do and let us decide... (Thin Cut Fries... YES!!!) this is a Funny place to order Fries I know and though they were good, I would rather the Chef use his Ideas, Imagination, Recipes or the internet over mine!\n\nSalad Dressings are so good it is hard to choose! I have enjoyed them ALL!\n\nFood here is Better than Del Frisco's (I will NOT be reviewing Del Frisco's) I have eaten at both in the Same Week!  The Sauces here are better than \""The Palm\""!  Value, Service and Desserts Here is better than Both!!!"
1,"Authentic New Orleans flavor and great family atmosphere.  Not pricey, and the portions are huge.  The fish is fresh, and the service is friendly.  Live music some nights."
1,BBQ shrimp...\nFried oysters...\nRBR...\n\nAll brilliant.
1,"We had our first visit last night. Fun, jazzy band, great atmosphere, but the food was the star of the show. Fried green tomatoes, BBQ shrimp, shrimp and grits, fried oysters... all excellent. Fast, polite, unobtrusive service, too. We'll definitely be back. A+"
1,"Lovely atmosphere, staff and food. Beau, our waiter, was extremely knowledgable about the menu and the wine. I suggest what Beau suggested...the pork medallions with pineapple pico and plantains. Amazing!  We sat on the upstairs patio and had a perfect evening.  Can't wait to eat there when we visit Charlotte again!!"
1,"This is a place that has earned my business for a long time to come after just one visit.  I will be back next time I pass through Charlotte.  Two friends had recommended this place for a business dinner and it did not disappoint.\n\nI brought a potential client here for a laid back, quiet dinner where we could talk and enjoy ourselves and it did not disappoint.  The staff was very patient while we waited for our guest to arrive.\n\nWe started with the New Orleans bbq shrimp which were expertly prepared in a not too sweet but slightly spicy sauce.  My party devoured this dish and raved about it.  I then had a bowl of gumbo which came with my meal.  I ordered it sans rice and again, an award winning dish.  Spicy and loaded with seafood, veggies, and sausage.  I could have eaten an entire bowl of this for my meal alone!  Next was the blackened, 14 oz. NY strip steak.  Simply stated, this was HEAVEN!  By far the best NY strip I've had in years!  Perfectly seasoned, cooked, and very, very tender.  I'd eat this meal a million times over.\n\nNow to the staff.  Very attentive and paitent and they gave us plenty of time to talk and relax over coffee at the end of the night.  We talked so long they restaurant had closed and the staff had begun their cleanup duties yet never once asked for us to leave, not even subtle hints like raising the lights.  They let us just sit and talk and talk and talk.\n\nThe dress in my opinion varies.  We were in jeans and button downs while some others had sport coats on.  A really good vibe and I'd feel just as comfortable dressed either way.  You will not be disappointed if you spend a nice evening here for your next meal!"
1,"Mmmm-mmm! I definitely picked the right place for my birthday dinner. We showed up slightly early and got to mingle in the bar for a few minutes- what a fun bar! I'm going to have to go back just for that alone. Then we were seated in the downstairs porch/sun room, or as my grandmother would say, \""on the veranda.\""\n\nWe had some trouble communicating with our server- one guest was late, and I think he was waiting on her to get there before we ordered drinks, but I can't hold that against him as he was just triple-sat. Next time I'll be clearer- alcohol now!\n\nThey have a great drink selection, including creatively-named specialty cocktails. I was tempted to order the \""Seventh Street Stumbler\"" and see if it held up to it's name, but in the end, a glass (um, or three) of white wine went well with my dinner.\n\nThe food was out of this world! We had the fried green tomato appetizer and devoured it. For entrees, I had the blackened salmon special with crawfish and artichokes, and my friends had the catfish, the chicken Diane, and the shrimp and grits, and we were all so busy making yummy noises no one could talk. I think we planned to try each others but they all disappeared so quickly we never got around to it. \n\nWe were too stuffed for dessert but that bourbon bread pudding is calling my name for next time. And there will be a next time."
1,"VERY rarely do my boyfriend and I leave dinner completely satisfied, elated and already planning our next trip. Well, Cajun Queen happened to be one of those meals.\n\nNeither of us eat cajun/creole very often so we were a little hesitant at first. After holding on to a Groupon for a few weeks we finally made the trip...what on earth took us so long?!\n\nOne step through the doors and you're immediately transported to a raucous, lively setting reminiscent of 1980's New Orleans. Tables are tightly packed; patrons share drinks and laughs; and sounds of jazz echo from upstairs. The walls are adorned by \""Nawlins\"" inspired artwork and an appropriate purple, gold and green palette is interwoven throughout the house.\n\nThe Gumbo was the only thing that I wasn't completely impressed with. It had good flavor and an ample helping of shrimp but I felt it was missing something. The consistency was thinner and more watered down than I anticipated. Keep in mind I am no cajun aficionado.\n\nThe boyfriend ordered the pasta special: Two blackened chicken breasts over a heaping portion of tortellini in a spicy pesto cream sauce with peppers, Andouille sausage, peppers, and artichokes. WOWEE MAMA. This was one of the most delicious meals (yes, it wasn't even my meal) that I've had in a while.\n\nMy \u00e9touff\u00e9e was delicious as well, thought admittedly, not quite as impressive as the pasta dish. It did kick some heat but it was good flavorful spice heat. Large portions seemed to be the theme of night and despite force-feeding ourselves to the point of pain, we both managed to leave with decent-sized leftovers.\n\nFrom the camaraderie and excellent service to the food and drinks...everything seemed to be perfect and I cannot wait to return!"
1,Excellent food the price is comparable especially on the creole dishes. You have to make reservations if you want to get a good seat otherwise come before six o'clock.
1,"Although I have passed this location on many trips to  Charlotte as well as when I lived her, today is my first time sampling the cuisine. I started with a very delicious key line Martini and the popcorn  crawfish both a sweet treat. The crawfish for sure should not be missed. Next course was a very fresh and impeccably spice cup of gumbo. For my main course I chose from the specials menu a piece of Mahi Mahi topped with shrimp taoso ham roasted red peppers and mushrooms served over garlic mashed potatoes.  The presentation was beautiful and the taste divine. All if the seafood was extremely fresh.   My husband chose this Resturant to celebrate our Anniversary and I am very pleased with his choice."
1,"Great atmosphere, Great food. The waiter Alex is the best at what he does. Truly had a great time!!!"
1,"I looooovvvvvvee this place.  When you step into the door you might as well loosen your belt a notch or two, it's time to get your grub on.  Here's my list of the GREATS at Chick Box: 1) Fried Chicken; 2)Fried Tillapia; 3)Fried Whiting; 4) Collard Greens; 4)Mac N Cheese.  Wash it all down with a cold lemonade. AAAHhhhhhh!!  Don't forget desert, coconut cake or Sweet Potatoes (Yams).  If you miss mama's home cooking you must try this place."
1,best fried chicken in charlotte.
1,"Oh Chicken Box, how I miss thee...... I haven't lived in Charlotte in over 5 years but yet and still I still crave this place and refer others there. It is good quality food so that is why I keep coming back for the same ole same ole. My favorite is their 3 piece wing dinner. I like there collard greens and their hushpuppies. I also like there sweet tea, although I think its their crushed ice I like. I also love that the food is made to order and always hot. So kudos to Chicken Box, and if you haven't tried it go!!!!"
1,"I drove by this place so many times not thinking much about it, until a friend from out of town wanted to try some southern fried chicken. I am so glad that I stopped by this place on a whim. They make the chicken to order, so expect to wait for about 15 minutes if you don't call ahead. The chicken is so crispy and the meat is incredibly moist. I love this chicken more than Prices' because it's less greasy. They have a drive-thru window that is for pick-up only, so your best bet is to call ahead and just drive up. I love love love this chicken!"
1,"If you were in NoDa, you've probably driven past Chicken Box and never even realized it.  If you ever noticed Chicken Box, what probably caught your attention is how many cars are out there!  That's what caused me to stop by the first time.  The parking lot was so insane that they had 2 people directing traffic outside!  I actually found a great recommendation on yelp and ended up calling in my order from the parking lot.  By the time I drove past the window, it was ready.  \n\nHands down though, they sell the best friend chicken I've ever had IN MY LIFE.  It's pure soul food / comfort food.  With their chicken dinners you get several sides, it's almost too much to contemplate.  Biscuits, hush puppies, amazing collard greens, mac and cheese.  It's amazing I've only been there twice.  It's an adventure though, it's always bustling with people and you have to be a little aggressive to get your order in, but it's well worth it.  \n \nLove."
1,This is where it's at.  The best soul food in town.  Prices really cater to working class folks.  I love the food and service.  Family oriented and great atmosphere.
1,"Closest to mom and granma's cookin from back in MY day i've had in the city since i've been in Charlotte, all was well , now I had two meals delivered by wewillgetit.com , so I did not experience the inside of business but even if they hang from the rafters at least the food is OUTSTANDING!  NEXT!"
1,"Have you ever heard the term, \""so good make you wanna slap ur momma?\"" This has been our post church brunch spot for a few months now. It's usually so packed we don't get a chance to eat inside, at least thats what I tell my wife so I can catch the football game lol. I recommend you eat here at least once in your life because one taste will have you ordering twice"
1,"One of the first things my son ever read out loud was the sign outside of Chicken Box. He wanted to eat there, and I was a little put off by the exterior. A friend recommended that I give it a try, and I owe that friend gratitude forever. The thing about Chicken Box is that the appearance is not fancy, but the food is AMAZING!!! Breading on fried chicken, chicken tenders, etc, that is the perfect crisp, seasoned to perfection. Melt in your mouth perfectly sweet cornbread. My personal favorite is the fried chicken livers, and they are the perfect crisp and breading on the outside, amazingly seasoned, and the liver is melt in your mouth tender inside. Not overdone. This is very important. The sides are to write home about. Cole slaw is the perfect crunch, just a touch of sweet. The potato salad is so good, I can't describe what makes it special and original, I just know I can't leave a bite of it on my plate. I could list about ten different sides that I have tried that I love, from greens to yams to fried okra to broccoli casserole, the list goes on and on. The only thing I don't like about Chicken Box is honestly how hard it is to decide what you want to eat because everything is so delicious and mouthwatering!  Whenever we ask my son where he wants to go, he always says 'Chicken Box!' Oh son, I concur, I concur!"
1,"Do you feel like these places typically rake you over the coals?!  Look no further!  I am grateful my friend originally referred me to BWP.  They are honest, extremely fair in pricing, and always go the extra mile.  I'd recommend them all day long!!"
1,Body Works Plus on Parkwood Dr in Charlotte is the best car body repair. We have used them for a couple of repair jobs and they have always given great service in a timely fashion at a fair price. We wouldn't go anywhere else and highly recommend them. You can follow your car's repair progress on their website to stay informed. This is great customer service.
1,"This place is the ONLY place in CLT for quality body work!.. Great work ethic, quality people, honest pricing and great customer service!  Our daughter's car was fixed in two days and looked superb when returned.  Body Works Plus is the genuine real deal!"
1,Nobody wants to be doing business at a body shop for the most part but these folks make it a pleasure. You get text updates on the status of your vehicle and they work with insurance to make the process painless. Don't hesitate to get your work done here if your car gets a boo-boo
1,"I would highly recommend Body Works Plus to anyone in the Charlotte area that is in need of body work. My experience with Brian, MeLisa and the rest of the staff was very positive. They were friendly, courteous, and professional. My final bill was was completely in line with what was originally quoted... i.e. no \""hidden fees\"" or extras. My vehicle was ready in the time they estimated it would be. They have an option to text you along the way to keep you informed of the status of your vehicle. They detailed the car for me as well, which was a very nice gesture."
1,"Honestly, I love america for businesses like this. These guys do a phenomenal job at what they do, just amazing. Service is quick, knowledgable and incredibly courteous. they know what they are doing. they are open saturdays. i drive out of my way to go there, and its just  a dry cleaner. also they do all the work on premises, which i think is a good thing."
1,"Bodrick's is neighborhood BBQ Joint with great food and packed into a small space! Great service, great BBQ, Wings,Sides, and desert! One of the best Mac and Cheese cook's in the southeast! Not much to look at on the outside, but lot's to brag on on the inside!"
1,"Mr. Moore and his team do really great work. Nobody likes having damage to their vehicle, but Dolan Moore managed to make an otherwise unpleasant experience not so bad. The work was done early, looks great and he was very affordable. I hope not to have damage to my car again, but if I do I will definitely go back to Moore's!"
1,"I have raced at VLK a few times, and I enjoy it more and more every time. If your goal is to achieve a personal course record, make a memorable event for a family member or have a corporate team building event, VLK is the perfect place."
1,"Loved it!\n\nI know NOTHING about go karting, cars, engines but my boyfriend who loves stuff like that brought me here for date night. We came around 10:45pm on Friday night. They had a running special so the boyfriend paid full price and my cost of entry was only $5. The workers were EXTREMELY helpful. Since we came so late, we were the only people there (excluding the group at the food area) so we had the track for ourselves. \n\nOne thing I really like is that you sign up and register upon entry and they automatically send you your race times and place number to your email along with giving you a print out. \n\nI had the best date night ever coming here."
1,"Christian and Hayley are rockstars.  Everytime you see someone with an awesome tat in Charlotte odds are they have done it.  Their work is professional and beautiful.  I put down a deposit and was told it might cost more based on the complexity and time but it didn't cost anymore.  Very fair, very good and I will definitley be back!!!"
1,"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nNathan Fish did an amazing job with my tattoo and I couldn't have been more pleased with it. I saw this picture online that I liked and printed it off as a basis for my tattooo. Nathan took the picture and made revisions for the specifics I wanted. The ending result was more than I expected, IT LOOKED BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL!\n\nI think another great thing about this place is the people are awesome. It is really important for me to connect with my tattoo artist, and I didn't feel that when I got my first tattoo at a different shop. I went with my best friend Winnie and she got her tattoo with Travis Lakeman. Her tattoo turned out amazing as well. Both our artists made us feel comfortable and at ease, which is important if you are sitting there for hours getting tattooed. \n\nNot to mention all of these guys are artists and you can see their art work displayed at each of their stations and in the art gallery connected to their shop. It is a great way to see their artistic abilities and expression, which is what tattooing is all about. \n\nThe overall experience was excellent and the price is extremely reasonable. They will not over charge you! I would definitely go back for another tattoo and recommend this place for anyone who wants a tat!"
1,"I've only ever connected in Charlotte, so I am of no use in regards to checking in or \""checking out\"" in Charlotte, but its one of the few airports I don't mind spending a layover in. Being from Roanoke, VA, I don't mind a down home southern feel to things and I feel as if this airport provides that. Giant rocking chairs line the main food court between terminals and an abundance of food choices makes picking a restaurant hassle free. My only complaint is that it is a US Airways hub and every US flight that I've been on in the past month has either been canceled or delayed without reason. I may be moving to Charlotte next year, so if I do and start using it as my main airport, than this review will get an update. You can also get wireless internet for free sometimes depending on which terminal you are in. Woohoo for free internet in airports!"
1,"My love for this place just keeps going up!\n\nAgain, mouthwash in little cups for me waiting in the restrooms...sigh...lovely!\n\nAmazing restaurant selections and everywhere, yes everywhere, in this place is CLEAN!!!!"
1,the rocking chairs in the middle is pretty neat. very southern... only airport/place in the tri-state area that has jamba juice.\n\nfree wifi if I remember correctly...
1,This place has the best USO I have ever been to!
1,"I love CLT!! My favorite airport to get stuck in. The people are nice, the food is greasy and somewhat southern, the wi-fi is free, and they have rocking chairs! What more could you ask for? Seriously."
1,"Charlotte Douglas airport  is a credit to the area.The place is clean , bright and comfortable.The people are friendly and respectful.\nWell done Charlotte.A1.Ya'll have a nice day ya hear.\nMy husband and I are plane buffs .Seeing the plane that landed in the Hudson at the air museum is a must."
1,THIS PLACE HAS MORE RESTAURANTS THAN I COULD COUNT!!! And everyone was so helpful and friendly.  Maybe I should visit Charlotte itself and not just their Airport
1,+ Relax on the rocking chairs\n+ Countless dining options\n+ Shopping and massage places to pass the time\n+ Plenty of seating at all the gates\n+ FREE WIFI!
1,"One of the best airports I've ever been to in terms of overall quality.  The airport has moving sidewalks everywhere, there are a lot of restaurants, there are rocking chairs everywhere for people to sit and relax, there's FREE WIFI, AAANNNNNNNDDD the bathrooms all have their own individual attendants that make sure the toilets have been flushed before you step in... it's the little things like this that make landing after a three hour flight more relaxing... I wouldn't hesitate to pick a flight again connecting through Charlotte if I have the time..."
1,"Gross, effektiv, schnell und kurze Wege. Das ist furmuns der Flughafen Charlotte, den wir 2 Mal im Jahr nutzen. Fur mich mein nach Las Vegas mein Lieblings Flughafen in den USA. \nEr bietet nichts besonders, sondern ist einfach ein gut organisierter Flughafen, wo uns meistens unser Schwiegersohn runterholt denn er ist dort Air traffic Controller fg\nLetztes Jahr den Rekord in der Immigratio aufgestellt: 15 Minuten und wir waren durch. Okay, wir sa\u00dfen auch in Reihe 5 und waren dementsprechend schnell drau\u00dfen aus dem Flieger."
1,"I connect here when possible. It's easy to navigate, free wifi, great restaurants and good shopping. I love the rocking chairs and plenty of USAir Clubs. If you're a frequent USAirways flyer this airport beats Philly and DC on the East coast."
1,"This place is huge, I feel like I'm at some kind of mall or something. It's by far the nicest and newest looking airport I've been to. Didn't mind being stuck in this nice airport for an hour or so. Got a little treat at Pinkberry and walked around. There are plenty of shops and restaurants and I never had a problem with finding anything or getting to or on my plane. Oh, and very clean!"
1,"I've seen a few American airports by now and i have to say that this one is probarly one the nicest and cleanest i've ever been. \nNice dining area and great food choices!\n\nStaff is very nice and as far as i relember, there are only a few airport who have restroom attendants."
1,"I have spent more time than I care to share in CLT but it is still my favorite airport. The layout is super easy and I feel comfortable knowing that I landed in C Terminal but am connecting in E Terminal, I know exactly where that is and how long it will take me to get there. I know where the decent food is at or if there is a TCBY nearby. It's like going to the mall in your hometown. I've already scoped it out and no where not to waste my time.\n\nThey always have free wifi and you can find power outlets all over the place. It's easy to find a spot to plug in and get some work done or just relax in a rocking chair on the main concourse. CLT feels small enough that you feel comfortable getting around but large enough that they're still getting shit done."
1,"CLT is my favorite major airport in the US. Am I biased because I work for the City of Charlotte and the City owns/runs CLT??? -Perhaps... but, even when I lived in Savannah (many moons before coming to Charlotte) I would purposefully schedule US Airways flights so that I could be routed throgh CLT rather than ATL. Maybe it's the rocking chairs in the main food court, maybe it's the amazing art glass in the international terminal, or maybe it's the fact that it's a super clean major airport that was well planned and easy to navigate -CLT provides travelers with an excellent first impression of the Queen City."
1,"I ALWAYS seem to have a lay over here when I'm going anywhere back home to Ohio, or to visit N.C. \n\nAnd all the times all my flights have been on time, nice airport. \n\nI love the rocking chairs they have for you to sit out throughout the airport. \n\nOHH and by the way they have nice and clean restrooms, because they have the bathroom attendants that help!"
1,I showed up at this airport late on a Friday night after lots of travel delays and cancellations-- so I was not in the greatest mood. But every single person that worked at the airport that I interacted with was incredibly kind and thoughtful. They were so wonderful that it made me want to move to NC. Charlotte airport is incredibly lucky to have such amazing employees.
1,"I travel really often, both domestically and internationally, and I must say this airport is one of the most excellent airports ive been to! The people who work here are so so pleasant and kind. And there a great variety of food options that are all close together."
1,"Over the years I have hit a number of airports, Charlotte Douglas was a main stay for several years and is now a pass through for me as it is a US Airways hub. I love this airport. First - the array of rockers - Carolina Rockers of course - to sit and rock and people watch. The Grand Piano in the main area always seems to have someone tickling the ivories and it is wonderful. There are plenty of plugs around the airport to top off you cell phone or computer. There is free wireless. There are a number of food choices and some very friendly people serving. What more could you ask for? Well how about art. The mobile of all the planes from the history of aviation are in the main lobby, and more art can be found around if you are looking! Enjoy this one, It is a good one!"
1,"I had to go from B to E, and it only took about 10 minutes. I thought that I'd have to change terminals but nope! Great shops and restaurants, very clean, easy to get around, beautiful gardens inside too"
1,Clean and open airport. Loved it!
1,"Well, this isn't a normal store anyone can just walk into and buy from, but I guess if it's on Yelp it deserves a review.\n\nThere are two ways to access Classroom Central, one as a teacher (or principal, etc) working at a school with a certain percentage of students on the free lunch program,  another is as a volunteer (and the point of view from which I'm writing this).\n\nThe set up is fairly simple, a store (with shopping carts) shaped in an L lined with notebooks, binders, die cuts, pencils, pens, lined paper, calculators, glue - a lot of basics teachers needs to successfully teach in their classroom, and often have to spend money out of their own pockets to provide for their students. Here, though, through loads of donations, supply drives, and volunteers, the teachers can \""shop\"" for free. There are even backpacks, lunch boxes, and assorted prizes that can be purchased for the students. There is a whole system set up of max amounts per item and max items total so every teacher isn't supermarket sweeping it each month, but with some \""buying\"" around $400 worth of supplies each trip, this place is really assisting educators. \n\nJust a great group trying to help out teachers and programs that already face enough problems and budget cuts as it is - can you really say anything bad about it?"
1,"Just purchased several appliances from Queen City.  I primarily worked with John at the location on Queen City Drive.  John was great to work with!  Actually, everyone who helped me were all top notch!\nWhat a great experience shopping for appliances!  I imagine this is how appliance shopping used to be.  Great selection in the showroom, knowledgeable and helpful sales folks who negotiated good pricing and delivery folks were good as well.  I cannot imagine a better place to buy appliances in the Charlotte area."
1,"My wife and I ordered a new washer and dryer from Queen City and everything went as smoothly as possible. The sales rep, Mike Coscarelli, was real easy-going and not in-your-face and the units were delivered to our ordered and delivered to our home within a week. \n\nDelivery and set-up went smoothly, too; the delivery crew was on-time, professional, and set up our new washer and dryer quickly. They even discovered we had ordered parts we didn't need and made a note on our receipt to get a refund.\n\nWe like to support local businesses, and it's nice when the quality of service is as good as or better than the big chains. Queen City didn't disappoint!"
1,"WC catered our Thanksgiving office party and did a nice ob. We ordered a traditional turkey and trimmings meal. Everything tasted delicious. The turkey was not dry as it sometimes can be, and I was a big fan of their mashed-potatoes and tea (I mix sweet & unsweet together). High marks for a great job!"
1,"Value Village is the bomb. Yes, you do feel the need to wash your hands upon departure and not to make eye contact with other shoppers sometimes, but that is the price you have to pay if you want a \""fight the power\"" t shirt for a buck fifty or a Marmot lightweight blue down jacket for seven fifty or two dresses or some vintage G.I. Joes. You know just your basics for happy living. How else could anyone know I am a fan of Chuck D, if I didn't wear my new t-shirt. Bring the noise. Yeah, boyzzzzzz."
1,"Lemme be clear.  I don't own a gun.  I'm not into shooting guns, or particularly even holding one.  (My hands shake and I start feeling nauseous.) But I gotta say, after being in a few different gun shops for work...this place really takes the cake.  \n\nI agree with Dave S.  that Hyatt is a very highly respected shop.  It's in fact one of the top 10 largest in volume gun dealers in the entire country.  (One of the store employees even printed out the article to show me.) \n\nYou'll see the vast selection of firearms on the walls, in the cases...and all the employees I talked to know their stuff inside and out.  I was told the story behind machine guns, and the history behind certain handguns.  \n\nThe place is almost ALWAYS packed (even on Black Friday...when they don't offer any discounts/sales) and what I admire is how the salespeople take their time with each customer no matter how busy it is.  The fact the customers all wait patiently and don't get mad...now that's loyalty."
1,"I've started attending a defensive pistol shooting club and one of my friends has lent me a gun to use, but I need some of the accessories to go with it. A proper holster, some speed loaders, a cleaning kit, a trigger lock and a bunch of 'dummy' bullets so that I can safely practice reloading. I headed to Hyatt because they have everything!\n\nThe staff is very helpful and were more than patient to point out where stuff was in the large shop and provide expert recommendations. They have a great selection of all of the stuff I wanted, but I think that the prices were quite high. If you are buying something that can ship in the mail (i.e., not a gun or live rounds), then you'll want to get it from eBay or one of the sporting supply shops online. You'll save a ton."
1,"Hyatt's has two extremely strong reasons why you should shop there: Selection and Service.   They have the best selection of firearms, east of the Mississippi river.   And the level of service is unmatched.   There are several \""experienced\"" gunsmiths on duty every day and if you need something fixed, it can usually be done while you wait.  The staff knows firearms and won't BS you.  The prices are higher than online, however they will accept a reasonable offer.   And if you are not happy, they will make it right."
1,It doesn't get any better than this. My heart overfloweth.
1,I don't know about nirvana but I'm pretty sure I saw black flag their it looked like a small house the stage was just a raised board so called punks slam danced one dressed like a doctor afterwards the band just walked off the stage and drank with the crowd.
1,Great Gyros! Its a hidden secret. Yum! Cheap prices too.
1,"OM to the Mofo G! This Place Is In the Airport, And Boy I Tell You What...The Buttery Flaky Biscuit  And The Crispy Seasoned Chicken Fillet is Freakin' Awesome!!! I'd Say Skip The Fries If You Cant Get Them Hot From The Fryer. But Please Do Have The Sweet Tea, Its Great! I Cant Wait To Fly through Charlotte Again! MMMMM... Chicken Biscuits!!!"
1,"Went in today for a kitty-cat laceration repair, and as usual, they were kind, remembered us, and were able to get us in.  My animals have always been diagnosed correctly, and come home clean and healthy.  I am so very grateful for Freedom Animal Clinic and its staff!"
1,"VERY good aviary vet! I took my single hood blue fronted amazon to get wings, nails and beak clipped. and they were very very nice. I will go back! the building is a older building but seemed clean enough as far as animal vets go that i have experienced in the past. \n\nthey weighed my bird and took very good care of him. it is impossible not to stress birds during this type of proceedure. but my bird recovered soon and they seemed to understand that I did not want to be around while they did it so that my bird didnt hold a grudge against me, which he didnt! \n\ni will be back!"
1,"I have eaten at BBQ King for over 10 years. They are the best! My Favorite is the BBQ Plate. I substitute Onion Rings for the French Fries that normally come on the plate. The rings are always good and crispy, the bbq \""melt in your mouth\"" tender and the hush puppies AND the coleslaw are the best around, hands down. I have made a lunch of JUST the coleslaw and a half dozen pups before!\nTheir tea is great and the Cherry Lemon Sundrop is made the old fashion way with syrup and a cherry!\nI like the the hamburger steak, the ribeye sandwich and the PO Boy. \nYou can't beat the people that work at the BBQ King. It's a family business and you get the feeling you are part of the family!\nIf you get a plate, come hungry!"
1,"CASH ONLY\n\nGreat dive place.  Heart attack on a plate.  Lotsa of tasty greasy fattening food.  Loved the chicken bbq and the onion rings.  If you are into  Americana, this is the place for you.  Tip the guy that brings the food a little bit and ask for extra napkins."
1,BBQ chicken. Best in Charlotte. Bring a bib---or turn your cape around.
1,I'm leaving California and moving into the parking lot.
1,"I heart Modern Salon.\n\nAn amazing value - got a great haircut and a relaxing (didn't realize that was possible) eyebrow wax here yesterday... only $65!  Lesley gave me the exact haircut I was looking for, all while fixing the goofy layers I was growing out from my last busted haircut.   The service was fantastic... as long as I am in Charlotte, this is the only place I will go.  \n\nTip - they do not let you put tip on the credit card, so make sure you have cash with you!"
1,"I've been getting my haircut here once a month for the past 10 months. I'm very happy. Prior to coming here I went to salon Cielo in the mall and occasionally would go to barbershops depending on what style I was going for. I love the atmosphere in there and the staff is super friendly. Megan is the stylist that I regularly go to. I definitely recommend her for haircuts, she's great. \n\nI thought that I'd have a hard time finding a great stylist and a great place to get haircuts, but that's just not the case. A+"
1,"I wouldn't normally review a McDonald's on this site because...well, it's McDonald's.  If you're not familiar with them, are you from another planet?  This particular one across from SouthPark Mall deserves its own entry, though, because of its uniqueness.  Due to SouthPark codes, they had to make McDonald's blend in, and they did a nice job.  The two-story brick building is actually quite attractive and \""fits\"" in with the upscale SouthPark \""theme.\""  \n\nIt's conveniently located across from the mall...and in front of Original Pancake House.  I had the pleasure of dining at this McDonald's when OPH had an hour wait.  We wanted to eat breakfast and get on the road to do some shopping and that long delay wasn't fitting into our schedule.  Cut to:  us walking from OPH to McDonald's, not more than a few feet away.   We ordered breakfast and sat upstairs on the second level.  Breakfast was good, as it usually is there, and it was fun looking out the window at the SouthPark area.  How often do YOU get to look down on SouthPark people like they look down on you?  Ha!"
1,"I love this McDonald's. They are always so kind and care about their customers. One day this Spanish woman accidentally gave me breakfast burritos instead of my sandwich. When I came back she realize exactly what happened and quickly traded them out. Today when I came, two weeks later she gave me a brownie for no reason. they also make the best iced coffee around."
1,Stopped in here for a business lunch. A bit loud but still was able to speak clearly.  Ordered up some shrimp tacos.  Was warned they had a bit of a kick. They did and they were good!  Really enjoyed them.  Service was dead on too.  Def a place I would go back to again if I was in the area.
1,I LOVE LOVE LOVE the chicken supremes! SOOO Good! I also love the sweet potato fries. My husbands favorite is the penne pasta dish with the sausage. It is really tasty.  Great place. I highly recommend!
1,I lost my IPAD.\n\nWhere could it be?\n\nRetracing my steps after I arrived in Raleigh I thought to call Harper's in Charlotte where I had lunch the day before. Apparently I had let my IPAD slip from my bag and I left it in the booth where I had dined. \n\nThanks to the honest wait staff it was returned to the managers who I contacted and had the pleasure of speaking with Curtis Stevenson who took down my address and promptly mailed it back to me.\n\nI appreciate Curtis taking the time to return my valuable tool to me immediately.\nHe understood my needs and took fantastic care of his customer.\nThanks Harper's and especially Curtis Stevenson!
1,The fajitas were delicious!
1,"Harper's. Great place. Good food. Knowledgeable staff. Had the Cajun omelet for lunch on Mother's Day Big crowd, but staff did a wonderful job. I will return."
1,"I grew up around the corner from Rusty's and I've been going here for as long as I can remember. You walk in and they've got a nice selection of canned and bottled beverages - including beer. Then you walk up and order from the guy in the kitchen. I usually get a chicken salad sandwich - so good - but today I tried the black bean burger and it was really good. It had salsa and cheddar cheese on top, and a side of sour cream. Sandwiches don't come with anything but a pickle, so you have to order fries on the side if you want. After you order, you continue down the aisle to the cash register - passing by chips, fountain soda, sweet tea, etc.. You pay and get a number, and then they bring your food to your table. Everything is always tasty, the people who work at Rusty's are always incredibly sweet and it's overall a great experience."
1,"Awesome bacon cheeseburger!!! The people at Rusty's treat you right all the time, day in and day out. I love this place!"
1,"We have been so impressed with the staff here.  They are always prompt in responding to our service requests.  The two service guys that work here currently are very professional, courteous and knowledgeable.  The office staff are always friendly...and trust me, we have seen some of the worst!  We only have one neighbor that seems to think this is a college apartment (and the staff have been dealing with them), but suffice it to say we really recommend Oakbrook to anyone looking for a great, affordable apartment in the Pineville area.\n\nIt's also really close to 485, so getting to the highway doesn't take much time at all.  It's also really close to good shopping centers.  And to cap off my review, I gotta say how awesome it is to live in a place that is shaded by tons of trees and isolated from the noise of Park and Johnston."
1,"Brian{Syvrud} was patient, available, creative, professional... truly a delight to work with! \nGreg Dunlap} did an excellent job communicating and managing the construction project beginning to end!"
1,"Most Fun and Relaxing Surgery I have ever experienced!\n\nTable-side manner is very important when you could potentially experience pain and possibly pass out!  Dr. Lind and his Assistant had a great sense of Humor while being completely professional and were very careful to help me feel as comfortable as possible!\n\nThis was a minor operation on the same toe that has undergone a similar surgery by a different Physician, many years ago before Jongeys walked the Earth.  When informing the staff here that the previous anesthetic did not work, they were confident that the drugs had improved over the years.  Hummmm... as I suspected the \""new drugs\"" were indeed \""better\"", though even after extra injections I could still feel some of the procedure (mostly only a few sharp pains that were only momentary) and minor discomfort compared to what I had experienced before!\n\nDr. Lind and his Assistant made sure I understood my \""at-home\"" post-surgical work to insure the best healing outcome!  The Receptionist was great too, very friendly and patient!"
1,"When I get sick, I kind of get happy. Not because that means my diet will most likely consist of soup and ice cream since those are my sick comfort foods but because of Carmel Family Physicians.\n\nI've been going here for the past 5yrs and could not be happier with the treatment I've gotten. From bronchitis to strep throat to sinus infections to upper respiratory infections to food poisoning--they've helped me with almost everything under the sun. They are located right near the CMC off 51 and 485 and have very convenient hours---I'm talking until 8P on weeknights plus Saturday and Sunday walk in hours. In the past I've been able to call in for an appointment the same day which is pretty much unheard of at any doctor's office I've been to. They have a number of doctors and physician assistants there Clint Price is awesome, so see him!\n\nNice staff, recent magazines, in and out within 20 minutes. Yeah, I dig."
1,"My doctor is Jessica Kaiser - she's one hell of a lady.  They have a new online system that you can make appointments and ask for refills with, which is very convenient.\n\nI think she's the greatest MD I've ever had :)"
1,"Simply put, This is the best Chinese-fare in the city.Served fast and hot by attentive Wait Staff."
1,We eat here at least twice a week. You can't beat the low prices and good quality of food. I generally don't like Chinese....I prefer Thai but their food is so flavorful. I love the chicken with garlic sauce with chicken wings. I know it sounds crazy but the wings are good.
1,We have been coming here for many years.  The food is always great and the service is fast.
1,"I figure I'd add to this review too, my sister (michelle r. here on Yelp) already wrote a great review and I just wanted to say that I agree with her that this place is really authentic!  I come here for lunch all the time to try their different lunch specials.  If not the special, yes, the katsudon is delicious (served w/ rice and onions and an egg on top!).  So are their bento boxes, I'll usually order their grilled mackerel.  And yes, their sushi is also really good.  My only complaint would be that it's a little small and it can get too crowded and busy, when that happens I'll go to the other Japanese restaurant right around the corner..."
1,"First of all it must be said that this is a JAPANESE-style sushi house. If you are new to sushi or the Japanese culture, this will not be the restaurant for you. \n\nJapanese style means that when you need a drink refill or want to order something extra, you must wave down the waiters as is the culture in Japan. Americans and we southerner's especially, are not used to this type of service. This is why most of the people that eat in this restaurant are Japanese. If you eat lunch between 1-2PM you will have better service.\n\nThe food is also VERY Japanese. The emphasis is on the fresh fish and the rice. If you are not accustomed to Japanese food, then you may want a non-Japanese sushi bar like Sushi-101 (Mexican made) or Rusan's (Indonesian made) or several others in Charlotte which are Chinese. You will find many varieties of fried sushi with sugary mayo in these locations if that's your idea of sushi.\n\nI have eaten here every week for years. It is a small restaurant with basic rolls. They are very consistent and the food is always excellent. I have never gotten \""brown wasabe\"" or fish that I didn't know what it was. The Bento boxes at lunch are excellent with 2 pieces of big roll, a maki roll, soup, salad and usually a bit of seafood salad for about $8.\n\nI have eaten at many Japanese style restaurants and must admit it has taken me a while to understand their culture. Now that I have explained it to you, maybe you will be able to enjoy Musashi's great food. If great service is most important to you, find a culture that is known for that like the Thai people at Thai House."
1,"FINALLY, a place to satiate my ramen needs!  Potato croquette!  Curry katsu! There is hope for the Charlotte Asian dining scene! \n\nYes, the previous reviews are spot on-- authentic Japanese (minus the obligatory California roll and special sushi rolls) in a super charming space (Don't be thrown off by it's location next to the Little Caesars.) with friendly family-run service.)\n\nThis place is packed with fellow Asians (not the speed-racing kind like Ru San's) which is always a good sign.  \n\nTIP: Get the lunch special A or B.  You'll see examples of A and B at the front of the restaurant.  The special is $8 and is plenty of food.  (Last time, it was a curry katsu bowl and a bowl of miso ramen. The other was a mini version of the dinner bento box.) \n\nTo the reviewers who had poor sushi experiences, claiming the rolls are similar to the pre-packaged ones at the supermarket, and un-fresh: I urge you to try Musashi again. I always find the rice perfect and room-temperature and seasoned well. Also: to those who complain the sushi menu is small, yes, it's less than a page.  However, who wants a phone-book-sized-menu if the food isn't good? \n\n(If you want to talk supermarket sushi, DYK restaurants like Soul Gastrolounge actually serve the supermarket brand as their own...and nobody knows!  In fact, it's pretty good, considering.) \n\nI also don't think the service is unfriendly at all!  Maybe being busy and task-oriented (not taking time to chit-chat) is mistaken for unfriendliness...I duno, I just call it efficient! \n\nTIP #2: You can't get their udon or ramen to-go.\n\nBottom Line:  If you're accustomed to some noodle houses in New York or LA, or in cities with large Asian communities, no, this place isn't going to be on the same level-- but sometimes you don't need all the frills.  Just a solid meal, run by a family you can tell knows what they're doing."
1,"I have been going here for too many years to count, and it is hands down the most authentic Japanese restaurant that exsists here. This is not American Style Japanese this is REAL YUMMY JAPANESE FOOD!"
1,This is the only authentic Japanese place in Charlotte. I lived in Japan for 3 years and I can tell you first hand this is a close as it gets without spending $2000 for airfare! The food is awesome. The people are awesome. The place rocks!\n\nTo all the people giving this place 3 stars and complaining that the chicken was not great and the salad should have had ginger dressing.....this is an authentic Japanese restaurant. Not the American Hibachi down the street. Japanese is not a big room with large grills with guys flinging food all over the place creating small fires. That is an American Invention and THIS is what Japanese food tastes like and how it is served. But then again American Stupidity on what other cultures food tastes like knows no bounds....TACO BELL?\n\nThe service is slower because you are supposed to talk to each other and enjoy your company and not scarf down your food like a couple of baka gaijin. It's Japanese!\n\nAgain hands down the best place in Charlotte to get authentic JAPANESE FOOD like it is served in Japan in every small town and small food/bar in the country. This is NOT American style Japanese it's AUTHENTIC!
1,"Authentic Japanese food in an otherwise nondescript location. Fresh and generously sliced sashimi, lightly breaded tempura done right [not a heavy batter used to disguise miniscule portions of vegetables and cocktail shrimp], flavorful ramen and noodles, and housemade sauces for nearly all their dishes, including the light miso-based salad dressing! We ordered the fried baby crabs and tofu for appetizers [tofu was divine...not overly cooked], then a sashimi platter, a ramen, an udon, a tonkatsu entree and the spicy pork belly w/kimchee dish [an unusual item for a Japanese restaurant as I believe it's a Korean dish, but wonderfully prepared nevertheless]. None of the dishes were too sauce-heavy or overly fried and the soups/broths were not too salty. As a result, you could actually taste the food...what a concept!"
1,A group of friends and I had a great time at Musashi.  We were in the elevated room with floor seating.  I have not had traditional ramen soup before - it was great!  I think we were probably a little much for the typical crowd there so maybe don't show up with a ton of bros in tow.
1,"I have eaten sushi all over the US, and in Japan. Musashi is by far one of my top 3 favorite sushi restaurants ever. Wonderful service, delicious sushi and I prefer their traditional menu rather than overly Americanized sushi (with cream cheese, cooked meat, etc). \n\nIf you want traditional sushi in a quiet, friendly environment this is your place. If you're looking for trendy, loud or flashy, look elsewhere. \n\nThe restaurant is on the small side, however when my husband and I had an early dinner there, we shared the space with a large group. It didn't feel overly loud, but I would try and go at off hours if you are a large group, simply because I'm not sure they could have fit more than one group of over 4 people."
1,"Oh how I've missed you! They didn't have D&D where I moved from and I absolutely love this place. Its fun to come have lunch, get some gourmet food, excellent coffee and wine  - and just hang. Beautiful outdoor seating that makes it feel a little less 'south' if you know what I mean ;)\n\nIf you are big city, like me you will love."
1,"North Carolina has 3 D & D and Chicago has zero? I love the grocery store attached to this place If I didn't just go nuts at Dillard's, I would have had room in my bags. We were there for a late dinner. I actually thought they were closed as it was just before 9. We started with a bottle of Parcel 141. I ordered the Chilean Seabass. Very light and flaky with a mild buttery taste. The server was on top of us for the whole meal. Aces to this place, as well as the eclectic mellow atmosphere. Very relaxing. We took a bourbon pecan pie and key lime to go as we had already eaten more than enough. Or was that drinking I was thinking of? Great place. Would love to go back!"
1,"A friend here said you must go here. Well that was some good advice. Nice size bar and plenty of tables spread throughout. Atmosphere very nice, they had 2 folks playing music that was a good mix and enjoyable. Started with a bottle of wine. I went for the scallops. They were delicious, quite large and full of flavor. Our server was top notch. Very attentive and kept the wine glasses full. They also had a full market attached to the place. All kinds of goodies to be had. we took some pies for the road. I had the pecan and was eating it on the plane, wanted to tell the pilot to do a fly by. I want more. We need this in Chicago. This is a must stop if you are in the area."
1,"Yeah, all these locations are excellent.  The know their stuff."
1,"I love to eat here and pick up specialty grocery items too. Their tuna salad with lemon zest in it is fab and so is the rotisserie chicken salad. My kids love to make custom sandwiches at the sandwich bar. I've never had anything here that wasn't delicious. It's trendy, upscale and just a great place to go."
1,"I try to stop by D&D during my Charlotte business trips because the selection is super fresh and absolutely delicious.  The price can be high, but it's worth spending when you can get such quality products.  Alas, my favorite is their dessert section.  They have specialty desserts (e.g., cupcakes, cheesecakes) in one location and a small pastry selection near the check-out register.  I feel the desserts are very reasonably price.  Even if you don't go to D&D's for a full meal, swing by for coffee and dessert - you will NOT be disappointed.\n\nCheers!"
1,"So this place is super fancy. And get ready to shell out the $$$ for the average meal or drink. But having said that, I had the greatest experience here. New in town, I stopped in here with a book one sweltering summer's day, and flipped through my pages over a delicious glass of sweet tea. When I was ready to leave, I asked for the check, put away my book, opened the little black cheque holder, and found a little note saying 'Have a nice day! :)'. It made my night."
1,"Gluten Free/Allergy Sensitive\n\nHuge GF menu with many options for appetizers, entree's and dessert!\n\nI alsoways have the GF cucumbers, Shanghai Noodles, and chocolate dome.\n\nNever had a problem here-the waiter told me a secret the GF food is always served on round plates and the non-GF is served on square plates."
1,This has to be my favorite place to eat.  The food is always consistent and worth waiting for.  I have never had a bad meal here.  I crave the orange peel shrimp occasionally and have to go get my fix!  Their lettuce wraps are the best around.  I've tried them from other restaurants and they don't hold a candle to PF Chang's.  \n\nIt is very moderately priced and affordable but the ambiance of the establishment gives you the feel of a more upscale and expensive dining experience.  If you haven't been yet you have to try it!
1,"Five star and all star! Ok, so if you're looking for a great steakhouse without the prententious atmosphere I think you'll find it here.  It's my favorite premium steakhouse based on the fact they treat you like family every single time.\n\nThe wine selections are great and plenty.  I normally stick with the house Merlot or Pinot Noir.  Of course I normally always get a steak so always reds for me ;)\n\nAs you might know everything is a'la carte and served family style.  They have a great selection of salads and the blue cheese wedge is an all time classic there.  The sides for the entrees are also fantastic.  I normally stick with the asparagus friti or the three cheese mashed potatoes.\n\nI've had both the lobster and a few of the steak selections when visiting.  My favorite steak there is the filet mignon oscar, medium, slightly pink in the center.  Always served to protection and a perfect temp.  \n\nDeserts are no slouch either here.  Most are pretty large and of course one of my favorites is probably one of the largest they have.  The 7-layer chocolate cake....chocolate overload!\n\nNo doubt, this is a fantastic place for a quick bar bite after work all the way to special dinners for anniversaries or just because type dinners.\n\nNOTE:  The Palm also has a 'rewards program' of sorts.  You join for I think $50 for the years and you get a point for every dollar spent.  Once you reach 500 points you automatically get a free 3lb lobster for your birthday....ummm.....yes!"
1,"Another fine steakhouse. Another 5 star review. Palm has been on my list for quite some time and C and I finally pulled the trigger last night.  Happy camper would describe us both, oh yeah, full would also work.\n\nStarted with the calamari just to see if it would be better than Del Frisco's.  Apples and oranges in terms of preparation but, it was crisply breaded, still tender and served with lemon and some awesome Marinara sauce.  Unless you have 4 - 6 people dining with you, get the small portion.  I didn't realize there was a small and goodness, the plate we got was huge and piled high.  Sounds good for lunch today though!\n\nWe both had salads, her's the mixed greens with garlic vinagrette and mine a Caesar.  Mine was good, her's was really good with the dressing being a star.\n\nFor dinner, I went all out with the surf and turf.  A NY Strip, medium rare and half a 3lb lobster.  This was as good or perhaps even better than any other strip I've had in town.  Almost butter knife tender, juicy, flavorful and cooked to the perfect temp.  Lobster was good just cause lobster IS good but there was nothing overly remarkable here.  Sweetie opted for the chicken parmigiana which was also a huge portion so there is half of that in the fridge too.  It was delicious and the marinara makes the dish.\n\nDessert was a shared fresh berries and creme anglais.  5 stars here for the perfectly chilled raspberries, blackberries and strawberries and a just sweet enough creme to dip them in.\n\nService was friendly, professional and not too stuffy the way it can feel at some other high end steakhouses in town.  She recommended a very good bottle of Pinot Noir at a reasonable price point which was a nice addition to the meal.\n\nExpensive?  Ummmmm, yes.  If you eat as described above you will be closing in on 3 bills, pre-tip.  BUT.... There are other options to choose that are much less expensive should you want to not blow up the Visa too badly and I am quite sure they are prepared just as well.  A definite come back to place for us despite the haul from LKN."
1,"We had another fantastic experience at the Palm recently. This time I tried the blue cheese & bacon burger. It did not disappoint! Once again Holly, our server, was top notch!"
1,"OK... I think I'm sold that Palm is my favorite Steakhouse in Charlotte.  Basically, I like most all of the high end joints so, it's a close race but after my second Palm visit, I have to give it up to them.  \n\nMy wife and I took her parents and her sister there last night as one of her dad's birthday presents.  Everyone was very happy with all they ate.  Detail wise, I'll stick to just my meal for this review.  Took advantage of one of the summer specials and went with the Filet and Lobster tail.  This also came with a choice of a starter and a side and yes, of course I super-sized the steak and tail once I found out I could!\n\nFor the starter I had the lobster bisque which was poured table side.  It was hot, creamy and delicious although it did require the addition of a tad bit of salt at the table.  The steak came cooked to a perfect medium-rare with a great crust on it and the lobster tail was as big as my head and very moist and flavorful.  Had the three cheese potatoes au gratin for the side.  It was cheesy and good though it also benefited from a wee bit of table-side salt.\n\nService was once again friendly and impeccable and they are very accommodating to various special requests.\n\nCan't wait to go back next time!"
1,"Delicious steaks and crab cakes. Excellent waitstaff. Surprisingly good beer selection. I also really like the decor. With all of the caricatures... Personally I try to stay away from the steakhouse chains, but the palm is topnotch. If you're a fan of steaks it doesn't really get batter than the palm. A+"
1,"Ok, so my review of the Palm in South Park is LONG overdue, I mean three girlfriend's in the past overdue. I visited in the spring of 2012. The day started with a Bark for Life walk off of Morrison in lovely South Park on a picturesque day with one beautiful blonde date, and culminated with another first date a petite, cute redhead at this location. To get right into it, I have to say, they gave us great service at the Palm. That's something you can't put a price on. I mean really good service. Imagine having butler service for three hours, and the butler is driving a Mercedes, so you know he takes his job seriously.\n\nI met my date among a bustling crowd on a beautiful Saturday night.The waiter went out of his way to make us feel comfortable, and he was very attentive to our needs. I ordered the steak burger, it was very juicy, delicious, and bursting with flavor. It was an excellent portion size. The type of meat, we'll lets just say it was the expensive part of the cow, not rump roast. Unfortunately, I had only six bites of it because I had already eaten a sashimi appetizer at the Village Tavern in the Rotunda building in between dates. My date ordered the filet mignon, and it was delicious, cooked to perfection.\n\nOne goes to a place like the Palm for a special occasion, or like me for a blind first date on rare occurrences, but either way, you go for the service and the great food. They treated me like a king, and I will be back for sure. Come see how the other half lives at the Palm. It is sure to be a delight for you and your significant other. I wouldn't recommend the Palm for kids, unless they are very well behaved."
1,"Found myself alone for lunch and remembered the sign outside while visiting 'Moe's'.  Asian grill $5.99. Can't be good, right? WRONG!!!  This was EXCELLENT!  They had 4 or 5 choices of lunch choices and the flounder was excellent!  That and a diet coke was less than $9!  And again, did I say EXCELLENT???   Go, give it a lunch try..... You will see for yourself!  Oh, and the staff was almost too attentive, and extremely courteous.  Can't wait to take my office buddies."
1,THE BEST Chinese in Charlotte.  Hands down.  Great service.  If you are thinking of going to PF Chang's...keep moving down the street to Sharon Corners.  Shopping center is difficult to get in and out of but it is worth it.
1,"OPH was the first restaurant I came to when I moved to Charlotte three years ago and it was exactly what I was expecting from my experience at many other locations. An excellent breakfast served by friendly and knowledgable staff.\n\nI've had nearly everything on the menu and it's all excellent. Waffles (yes, they have waffles), strawberry pancakes, banana pancakes, french crepes, omelettes, sandwiches and my personal favorite, the Dutch Baby (with strawberries). It's basically a big pancake-like bowl, though baked not fried. Make sure you have it without the extra powdered sugar and squeeze some lemons on it. It's kind of hard to describe but believe me, it is worth it.\n\nI've seen people just having the eggs and bacon and I think - you are so missing out! The food is not greasy or oily, like I've experienced at some other breakfast places.\n\nThe coffee is excellent and the orange juice really is fresh squeezed.\n\nIf you're coming on a weekend for breakfast or lunch, expect to wait as long as an hour because the place is just that popular. Weekdays at dinnertime, you can get right in."
1,oph is so good!  anything on the menu is worth trying and the service is always exceptional.
1,"Pancakes, crepes, potato pancakes, hashbrowns, coffee, old fashioned oat meal.. There's so much to choose from and I can never settle on just one thing! I ALWAYS end up ordering WAY too much food at the original pancake house. It's all so delicious. I'm a big fan of the plain crepes and the chocolate chip pancakes. I get one of these dishes every time. The oat meal is really tasty, too. It's thick and hearty, not watery at all. The hashbrowns are the best in town, in my opinion. Chunks of potatoes and onions and yummy seasoning. If you're planning on arriving after 9am on a saturday or sunday be prepared to wait. They move people in and out pretty quickly, though! I've never had to wait very long for my food to arrive at the table and truthfuly, it gets inhaled pretty quickly because it's just so tasty!"
1,"I had breakfast here today with my Cousin, childhood friend and of course the Mrs.\n\nWe arrived at about 9:30 and had a 15 minute wait. It was a good way to catch up with the family. \n\nWhen we were seated our waitress Teresa came right over to take our drink orders. She was also very helpful answering any questions we had about the menu. \n\nAfter deliberating over the menu my wife had the Jr plate (three pancakes, one egg and two sausage links). I had the buckwheat pancakes with scrambled egg beaters and corned beef hash.   My cousin had the two by four platter and my friend had the pigs in a blanket. (I was tempted to try the Dutch baby as mentioned in other reviews but then I would have needed a nap). \n\nEveryone was very satisfied with their food. You get a lot of great food for a great value. When we left there was a thirty minute wait and now I know why. Timing is everything when coming here."
1,Love this place!  Great food and huge portions. Love to eat here every time we Re in the South park area around breakfast time
1,"I love this place, I always order the same thing at this location:\nHash browns and Eggs, Sub for banana nut Pancakes.\n\nHere is what you need to know:\nOriginal Pancake House is a franchise, however it is not the same in all locations, the Charlotte location's both share what appears to be the same menu. I have also visited the one in Northern VA, and South field MI. The main differences are the prices, combinations, and menu layouts. The main thing they all have in common is the best pancakes that you can find at a restaurant period.\n\nThat being said, every year after Ramadan ends, Muslim's usually go to breakfast. I credit myself as the person that fought for everyone to go to OPH, which I we know as OHOP, because everyone always wanted to go to iHop. There was a staunch iHOP supporter in our cliche, but she thankfully has retreated to Jordan, but sadly I have also made a tactical withdraw to Michigan where the OPH is not quite the same. \n\nWhy OPH, is better than IHOP:\n\n1. They will allow to sub anything for anything, and pay the difference, IHOP will not.\nexample: IHOP will not allow you sub meat for non-meat, even if you don't eat meat!\n\n2. OPH has better options for people who don't want to eat meat, but do want to eat eggs. \nexample: Hash brown and eggs Combo comes with Pancakes.\n\n3. OPH pancakes are perfection, IHOP pancakes are a joke and are only eaten as a result of good marketing and advertising. \n\n4. OPH has better syrup, made from fresh ingredients. The strawberry syrup is made with real strawberries, The Blueberry is made with real blueberries. \nThis cannot be said about IHOP. Think about that next time you are at IHOP trying to pull that syrup jug that's stuck on the table to pour over your lowsy IHOP pancakes.\n\n5. OPH omellets are bigger and better, granted that are different style.\nExample: I brought my friend there, and before we order I asked him, \""Are you ready?\"". He didn't what I was talking about until the mammoth omelet came out. I am sure OPH is a great way to put your kids to sleep for the day, worth trying. \n\nIHOP omellets aren't bad as long as they don't cross contaminate your food, with things you don't want.\n\nI think I have made my point, the take away here, is OPH has the best pancakes period, if you know better send me a message or something."
1,"Even the grumpiest of grumps couldn't find anything to complain about here. \n\nThe breakfast choices are so wonderfully indulgent. I'm dreaming about the baked apple pancake right now. Wait the 20 minutes for it, you will not regret it. The regular pancakes, waffles, omelets - everything is delicious.  The real fruit syrups are a do not miss!  \n\nThe staff is friendly and efficient. I love a restaurant where the servers actually work hard.  They move quick, they anticipate your needs and they make the customers happy. I'm guessing loafers don't last long here."
1,I love this church b/c the pastor is biblically accurate and the worship is very moving and that God is moving in this church. Life groups are awesome and the people are very friendly. God has his hand on this church and seeing it grow the way it has in the past few years is the reason that God has blessed this church.
1,I just ordered a knife from their online store.  It turns out their picture was wrong and I got the wrong blade.  I wrote them and Tiphany immediately sent me a prepaid FedEx label to return the knife and express mailed me a more expensive replacement at no cost.\n\nI'm very satisfied with my experience with them.
1,they always do great job! Love this place and all the staff here are friendly!
1,"The above \""review\"" was, we believe, written by the husband of one of my clients who did not like the outcome of our court proceeding. He was not even interested enough in it to show up. He told me that he was going to smear me and my reputation but I figured he was just another nut. Apparently, he is more than just that. Note his name (Blossom. Really?) and where he is from (Waco? or Wacko?). Readers can certainly take from the \""review\"" what they wish, but at least I am willing to sign my real name. By the way, I had to rate myself to get this posted; only reason for the review.  Alan Krusch"
1,"I have used Alan several times over the past 15 to 20 years. He is a caring and wise individual. I have always been very pleased with the service that Alan provided. If you need to get \""lawyered up\"" for a domestic case, I highly recommend Alan. As for the post from Blossom C, my guess is he was on the receiving end of a legal matter with Alan. As far as lacking character, weak work ethic, poor communications and limited knowledge, just the opposite is true."
1,"Absolutely love this place, perfect for Dinner and a Movie. It's located in the Phillips Place plaza which has trendy shops and a movie theater. \n\nThe bar or outside seating is perfect for a relaxing evening to enjoy some people watching. Dining room seating usually tends to take longer and the servers aren't as attentive, definitely not good for a quick lunch. \n\nAppetizers to try are; the cheese plate, Sweet & Sour Calamari (my fav) and their Mussel Pot. They have a great sushi selection, I normally have their Spider and Firecracker Roll which is always fresh and perfect. I recently tried their Queen City Roll and its absolutely delicious paired with a glass of Conundrum. The mashed potatoes and baby green beans are a great side dish for any of their menu items. Also, try their bread pudding dessert when they have it on the menu, it's the best in town."
1,"Let me start off this review by saying:  I got the hook-up for my trip to Upstream.  At the time, I was event planning, and one of the Harper's group gals invited some of my coworkers and I out for dinner/drinks one night after work to show off Upstream.  Everything I ate was PHENOMENAL.  \n\nThe one thing I will remember always, and will definitely order the next time I go back was this amazing tuna appetizer.  It had a few different kinds in it from seared ahi, to some tuna rolls, but the most impressive part was the presentation.  I wish I knew about Yelp back then, because I would have taken a picture.  There were some tuna things around the sides of the dish, but in the middle was an upside down glass, with just straight up sushi tuna filling the bottom part of the glass.  Spicy tuna rolls on top of the glass.  It was magnificent.  \n\nI'm not shy when it comes to eating raw things, and this was HEAVENLY.  Fresh, bright, delicious, and presented in such a cool way.  It's really the only thing I remember, but it stuck out enough for me to want to write a review about it.  I will definitely be back... someday!"
1,"Oh upstream how I love thee. Why am I writing yet another update with the same rating as the ones before you ask? So I can tell you about the brunch of course. This brunch is a monster of a buffet and tapas menu combined all for the low price of $25! Hold on you might be balking at the hefty sticker tag on this brunch but let me tell you about all the stuff you can well...stuff yourself with and you'll be singing praises too after you try this joint out.\n\nThis being one of my last weekends in Charlotte the boyfriend and I went with a yelpy crew consisting of Travis W., Melissa B., Chad E., And Denise. First off you walk in get greeted and led to your table and handed a nice tapas menu. They could've charged $7-10 for most of the items on this tapas menu and made a killing but nope they're giving it to you as part of the buffet, score! I tried the scallop risotto, crab benedict, belgian waffle, and some other things all excellent! But wait it doesn't stop there you walk into the bar area and BAM! you're hit with a massive buffet of brunch items. You want some smoked salmon and mushrooms folded into your freshly made omelet? No problem. Add some excellently carved prime rib onto that you got some good eats. I was so full before I even got halfway through working on this buffet.\n\nThis place has met my expectations for lunch, dinner, and now brunch. Hopefully I am back in Charlotte soon to give it another whirl. Though dinner is a bit expensive and they do need to tell you the prices of the specials lest you order a $45 bento box like I did, the staff is incredibly accomodating and attentive to your needs. Hell they even remembered my name and how I like my tea for lunch after the second time I was there! Give it a try, you can thank me later."
1,"5-STAR Brunch!! We've taken all our out of town guests here, and they've loved it. Worth the $30pp.\n\nCame here for happy hour bar bites, which was okay. \n\nNever been here for dinner."
1,Wow.  All I have to say is order the sea bass.  Period.
1,"I live right by here and go a lot. Staff is super friendly, food always excellent & great selection.  I usually just sit at the bar and order tea and dinner. It's more casual than the dinning area and I go alone often.  It is expensive, but you know that going in and it's ALWAYS worth it. The freshest and best quality seafood in town. I'd rather pay more for excellent than a little less for mediocre. They have oyster specials for $1 through the week during certain times and from 5-7pm a bar bites menu where many rolls and food is 1/2 off. Great time for dinner. Highly recommend."
1,"Great food! Great service! Our waiter was Christopher, and he was fantastic! He recommended excellent entrees, apps and wine that exceeded our expectations. We recently moved to Charlotte from NYC, and this is by far the best restaurant we've dined so far. The sea bass is almost as good as NOBU and the tuna... OMG!! Your mouth will love you, trust me. Enjoy ."
1,"This Y is huge. It has two indoor pools and an out door pool with diving pad for competition.  The kids have their own building with all kids activities in it. The pool area is huge, we didn't feel clutter at all for our weekly competition and the temperature are perfect.  I didn't feel like I was in the sauna.   The gym gotta be big too. Must come back"
1,"Inexpensive, fast, consistently good food - I love Showmars!  This location has a drive-thru which makes picking up dinner on the way home from work even more convenient.  \n\nMy favorites are the chicken salad pita (the chicken salad is simple, which is perfect!), calabash shrimp dinner (lightly breaded, good sized shrimp served with the best tartar sauce I have ever had), the gyro (either pita sandwich or dinner platter) and the All American Jr. Pita Burger (the regular pita burger is 2 beef patties, the Jr. is only one and is plenty).  The fries are always hot and crispy.  The salads served in flour tortilla bowls are very good (either the grilled chicken or the ham & Turkey chef).  The ranch dressing is home-made and delicious.  \n\nI have never had a bad meal from here, everything tastes fresh and delicious.  The prices can't be beat for the quality and the speed of pick-up makes for an easy evening after a long day of work.  I love Showmars!"
1,"I usually go to another showmars consistently, but I was in the area so we stopped in. The place was clean and the employees were very friendly. Showmars is also a 2nd amendment friendly restaurant which is great! Food came out hot and fresh and I was very happy with our waiter.  I will go back to this location soon."
1,"For traditional Mexican fare with large portions and no frills, this is a fine place. It's a little out of the way down there on Independence, but don't be fooled by the strip club and lingerie store in the same plaza -- for a strip-mall place, Don Pedro is a spacious treasure.\n\nEverything is good here, from the Camarones (Shrimp), Enchiladas, to anything with Pollo (Chicken) and Carne Asada (Steak). Rice and beans are heaping as the sides, and the fresh, hot chips and two kinds of salsa deliver nicely before the meal.\n\nYou can eat there as a family, with friends, for an office lunch, or even for a little party, if you're in the margarita mood. I've been to Azteca (which I believe is the same management) and the other Don Pedro (down there on Tryon near 485), but I tend to like this one a bit better.\n\nThe service is good, the food is authentic (our resident Mexican gave it a thumbs up) and on top of everything else, you leave smiling without spending too much cash. They even give you a little free dessert!"
1,"I didn't want to love it. I wanted to stick to our neighborhood places, where the ambience is lousy but the food seems authentic. I didn't want the margaritas to be big and cheap and delicious and strong. I didn't want the plates to be so huge, or the food to be so great, or the prices to be so reasonable. But Don Pedro GOT ME! Yes, it IS in a strip mall out on Independence, with some neighboring storefronts that give \""strip mall\"" special meaning. The interior does have a bit of the feel of a chain place, but it really is festive and fun, so why deny it? And sometimes there is a 5-piece mariachi band strolling around the joint ! But you are looking for good mexican food, so back to that - the food is excellent, the portions are huge and we've never tried anything there that we didn't love."
1,"Ok, so I've never actually bought a new car in my life until yesterday, so I don't have a gigantic frame of reference, but I was really satisfied with the service I got from Clarence, my sales rep.  \nWe bought a 2012 Sportage to replace our 08 Sorrento.  Throughout the process, Clarence was on it!  He clearly explained all of the numbers without the expected song-and-dance of the stereotypical car sales guy.  He was very easy to talk to, listened to my fairly picky set of requirements and conditions regarding my trade in and the new model, and was available to answer questions when I called him almost every day for a week.  He even picked up on the golf course on his day off.  \nMy wife and I both have credit scores that accurately reflect our long history as drunken restaurant employees, so we ran into some issues when it came to obtaining financing.  Several dealerships turned us down, including two that offer a 'Guaranteed Approval' promise.  Clarence and his finance department guys worked for a week on getting us approved.  They worked the numbers back and forth, helped us out on the price, and got us squared away with exactly the car we wanted.  \nThe car is warrantied for 10 years/100k, but I'll be calling Clarence again in 3 years for a new Sportage.\n\nPros:\n- Friendly, helpful staff\n- Good selection of cars\n- Really went the extra mile to help us get the right car\n- Solid service department\nCons:\n- None that we could see.  \n- They wouldn't let us take the cardboard cut-outs from the Sorrento commercial home with us.\nSide Note:  If you're in the market for a car, check out Kia.  If you're in the market for a Kia, BUY THE SPORTAGE EX, IT'S SUPER AWESOME!!  LIKE, DOUBLE RAINBOW AWESOME!!"
1,"I love this place for my nails and pedicure! I am so particular, PICKY and meticulous with everything from brows, skin and haircut and Tina does everything to perfection like the way I like it! I have never had to look at my French and say anything bad about them! She is perfect with polish, the smile line and making sure there is no cuticle or skin left! And Ricky is also da bomb at pedicures! If you want someone to get all the crust and cuticle, he is the one to go to!!"
1,Always great service.  I never feel like they are trying to take advantage of me.
1,"This is the most awesome place to get your car serviced if you have a Honda/Acura!  They are knowledgeable, friendly, do great work, and don't price gouge.  I got to where I would not take my car to be serviced as a woman, because I was always taken advantage of.  Compact Car Service has proven to me time and time again that they can be trusted.  We thought we needed new brakes 6 months ago and they told us we still had some time on them.  They could have easily sold us new brakes and we would have never known.  Recently both of our Acuras have been having problems and they have worked with us to figure out the problem BEFORE having us spend a lot of money to do something they think \""might\"" be the problem.  They have spent a lot of time on our cars, but until they find the problem, they haven't charged us.  I don't know anywhere else in Charlotte that would have done that.  They are good, honest, hard workers who don't take short cuts and don't sell you things you don't need.  I didn't think a car service place was out there like this.  We are so thankful we found such a wonderful place to take our cars.  Keep up the good work Compact Car Service!!!"
1,"What an amazing car buying experience I had here!!!  They know how to make you feel taken care of.  The dealership is gorgeous but the real treat here are the people.  Everyone is SOOO nice and accommodating.  It's \""above and beyond\"" in everything they do."
1,"I have purchased 4 Lexus . I had a 2001 IS, a 2002 GS 300, a 2006 GS300 and just recently purchased a 2013 GS 350. Since 2001 I have been in a Lexus and as far as customer service, sales and just overall experience has met and really have been above my expectations. That is why I really want to stay in a Lexus forever. Every Lexus that I've owed I figure it would be my last, but some how, the sales staff are willing to work with you and make it achievable. If I have my way, I will stay in a Lexus and the product makes it easy to be a returning customer. I was able to make my deal through emails. I never walked into the dealership, until I was ready to pick up the car. I didn't want to test drive it, because I know the history of GS (since I had 2 previously), but my salesperson insist that I do, so I took it around the corner and just like I thought, this is a car that really hit all the marks and then some. Hendrick Lexus gets it and I just wished that the customer service I receive for my other new car (which I want mention) had 1/3 of Lexus customer service practice. I tried my best to convince my wife not to buy that Volvo..I didn't mean to type that. \nI have told all that will listen that Hendrick is the place to buy or service your car. I get my car washed, good service and people that listen to you. I was in Columbia and I stopped in that Lexus dealership for a car wash and not once did anyone asked did I purchase the car there, it's a Lexus and it was washed and delivered back to me clean as a pin. I want to thank Hendrick Lexus for being on top of your game and treating each customer with value! GREAT JOB and thank you Hendrick Lexus for your excellent customer service!"
1,"This is a great local business to support. The staff is super nice and are more then willing to accommodate you. My husband and I occasionally stop in for bite. I love the friend chicken, fried squash and buttered rice. The meal comes with a soft, white, buttered roll. My husband always gets the super boy burger, which he loves. Ted's is definitely a greasy spoon restaurant, but perfect if you're in the mood for that. \n\nSweet tea- Very sweet \nFried squash- I call these golden nuggets of HEAVEN! Yes, they are that good! \nDesserts- They have a fridge of premade deserts e.g. baklava."
1,Awesome food! One of Charlotte's hidden gems!  I have been eating at Ted's for over 20 years and they ALWAYS serve excellent food!  I love the chicken on pita.... they have the best Tzatziki sauce!!  Yummy!!!  I also love their special Grecian chicken with the salad!!
1,"I absolutely love Ted's. They are always friendly and the food is yummy. The superburger for my son, Grecian Chicken for the husband, and they have the best veggie wrap for me. Gus is great. If you're just driving by and not stopping,  you're missing out."
1,"It's fairly obvious when you see an endless line of platters on the wall highlighting those who have had 200 or more different beers... the place is popular and its regulars are very much so.  This place is about beer, pure and simple.  The food is but an accessory.  They did have a nice pretzel side with some mustard that will clean your sinuses... I recommend that dish between beers 2 and 3, just to keep your beer to food ratio in balance."
1,"Ding Ding Ding!  We have a winner.  This is the best beer  brewery/tastery/deliciousry/savory place in all of Charlotte.  Well, at least I think so.  I just wish it was a little closer to Uptown (where I roam).  It is located up near UNC-Charlotte where I dont think the college youth truly respect good beer.  They are drinking the natty ice and PBRs of the world while this place serves over 300 better options.  Just sad.\n\nSeriously, when you walk in to this place you are figuratively smacked in the face with originality.  They do it all their way and you either love it or you don't.  I became a UFO member in about ummmmm 3 mins and 32 seconds.  $18 and you get a free Tshirt, membership card, and free brunch every Sunday 12pm-3pm for the rest of your life.  The brunch alone is worth it.  I went for beer on a Saturday and came back for brunch the next day.  The other perks are listed on the website and take a little time to accomplish.. Like try 200 different beers and get a $100 tab and your name forever enshrined on a plate on the wall.  I'm going for it!! \n\nDon't care about joining the BeerKnurd club... Thats cool too.  Just go on in and try the pretzel.. Let me rephrase that... YOU HAVE TO TRY THE PRETZEL.. I grew up in the Philadelphia area and we are used to brick pretzels.  Though the sad thing is that we like them.  Here, you get two huge... soft... fluffy.. wonderful pretzels.  How can someone be so excited about a pretzel, you ask??  Just trust me and order it.  Enjoy!\n\n-Ian M."
1,"This is a great neighborhood pub with a fantastic selection of great beers and nightly events/specials.  If you enjoy exploring the various tastes possible with diverse brewing styles, then this is the place for you.  Not only are there hundreds of beers available on tap and in a bottle, they also have a full menu.  The Hippie burger and the potato soup are great.\n\nIf you join the UFO club you receive opportunities for coupons, specials, events and free brunch every Sunday.  It's a great deal."
1,"Waited on by a Beer Goddess!  She knew the correct answer to every question, steered our menu choices, & knew how to handle gluten issues.  Usinger brats delicious, big dipper sandwich, pizza, & hippy hollow all likewise!  Wish they were in my neck of the woods.  Taco Mac would be out of biz!!"
1,"What can I say, I am a beerknurd.  Honestly I love this place.  Yes, some of the beers can get pricey, but there is nowhere else around that offers this combination of beer selection, atmosphere and service.\n\nThe beer selection is fabulous, there are so many great beers and many varieties.  It's a beer lover's paradise.  The atmosphere inside suits me.  It's dark, dark furniture, dark walls, covered with plates of course.  If you like a bright cheery clubish atmosphere, this isn't for you.  \n\nThe food is pretty good.  It's a little different than your standard bar fare.  The rocket tots are really good, so are the pretzels and most of the sandwiches.  \n\nI've been here many times, and the service, IMO, has always been excellent.  Even when I've gone at peak times, these girls know how to handle it.  In my experience it's been very rare that I've had to flag down a server, they are almost always on top of their game here.\n\nI definitely recommend this place if you are a beer fanatic.  You won't be disappointed."
1,The beer selection is amazing...definitely a place to check out if you are a beer person...all types of beer from all around the world...and I can't forget the food is pretty good too!
1,"First night in Charlotte and just wanted some bar food, nothing fancy. Thought it would be dead on a Monday night, didn't know they offer $3 draft beers on Monday night!  Service was great, Emily stopped by the table consistently to see if anything was needed.  When you ordered a beer despite how busy it was, it was on the table in a minute or two.  Had the Sheboygan Side-by-Side with fries instead of potato salad.  The fries were a little cold, but Emily quickly addressed the situation by bringing out hot fries making this a five star review.  If you like a a variety of beers, good brat's, and great service come to the Flying Saucer."
1,Great selection of beers. Not the best food but it's a beer bar after all. Was a better place when they had pool tables but not a bad place to watch a ballgame now.  \n\nMonday has really good specials for draft beers. And seasonal rotations offer great new selections.
1,"Awesome employees, amazing beer selection, you don't get ignored even if they're busy, the food is top notch, it's in a great location, and it's always clean. Can't get much better than that."
1,Great set of Drafts available. Great atmosphere for drinking. Its usually crowded on weekdays and weekends are worst.
1,"Great food, very impressive draught beer selection with lots of excellent local beers. Waitresses were outstanding. Our regular stop to and from Raleigh."
1,"Well it was my first time back here in a good long time- probably close to a year. As you can read from a past update, the service was really sub-par on my last visit. But I wound up meeting a friend for a few drinks and ordered some food. \n\nEven though the place was jam-packed on this particular Thursday night, service was still very quick, and we weren't kept waiting long at any point. \n\nOur server was overly-knowledgeable on the beers, and everything she had recommended was pretty spot on. And not like it was ever bad, but food was a little better than before. \n\nDon't know if they were just having a good night, but they have totallllllyyyyy redeemed themselves in my opinion. And yes, I had to ask about the particular manager from my last encounter and found out she was no longer with them. Added bonus!"
1,"Great place for breakfast, And for what it is a \""Diner\"" Eggs are always poached excactly the way i asked, my wifes always gets the french toast and is delicoius, coffee is always hot and nice and strong not watered down and weak like some other area diners,  staff is super nice and patient with my small children,  You will have to wait on the weekends though.  I have also frequented this place after a late nite out with the boys,  perfect after \""bar\"" \""club\"" type of place as well.  Place is always very clean.  crowd is from all walks of life young and old.   I Hope it remains another 30 years"
1,"This 5 star review is very different from most of my others. \nThis is a 5 star perfect run of the mill, ridiculously consistent, super friendly, makes me feel warm inside type of diner. But don't mistake it for anything else, it is a diner. A classic 24 hour, gets eggs & bacon whenever you want type of place.\nService is top notch (especially Sara & Myra) as well as most of the others. Coffee is always fresh and kept warm and full in my cup. Food is more consistent than other other restaurant I have been to in CLT. I know exactly what is getting put in front of me, and for a great price.\nI have learned to order my hash browns well done, because otherwise they are kinda raw in the middle, but they accommodate to any request with a smile. \nDinner plates are all great that I have tried as well, their brown gravy has a hint of cinnamon & nutmeg in it. A bit different, but once I got used to it I loved it! \nI almost feel my wife and I are here \""too often\"" but for great price and a wait staff who knows your \""regular\"" this is my go to place for eats any time of day."
1,"I usually do not get this kind of service at any rental car places, but this particular time I was very impressed. Shuttle bus driver took me straight to my vehicle, at the gate I just had to show my driver license and I was off to my destination. Return was just as fast, and shuttle bus was waiting to take me to the Charlotte airport. All personnel were friendly and helpful, will use Hertz again soon."
1,"I rent from National in Charlotte about once a month, and I'm consistently happy.  With Emerald Club, no lines at all, and there is always a good selection of cars (including hybrids).  Fast, friendly and efficient."
1,"Great selection, great service. Reccommended..."
1,The staff was very nice and helpful because I signed up for the Emerald program which made the return of the car so easy.  The rental location is very close to the airport through shuttle.  Recommended.
1,We love being part of the Emerald club. Debbie was great. Our goto car rental location.
1,"The most seamless car rental experience ever.  The agents were super friendly and helpful, and it was really easy getting the car, dropping off, etc.  Recommend."
1,"After a fiasco with another car company, I showed up with tears in my eyes at the Enterprise counter. Maleah was so incredibly helpful and caring. The group that helped me at the actual car rental site was equally professional and you could tell that they enjoyed working with each other. Even though other car rental places might be cheaper, the level of customer service that Enterprise provides is worth the extra couple of dollars."
1,"Amazing customer service. Quick, friendly, great car selections and they give you the option to  choose which car you would like from their lot. Fast shuttle to take you to the airport. Can't believe how smooth and fast everything went."
1,"When we needed to replace our heat pump, I did a ton of research on companies - even had a few of them come in and give estimates on doing so.  Most of them were pretty close on price.  In the end, it came down to two things that helped make the decision on which one to go with.\n\nThe first part of the decision was the company who made us feel the most comfortable.  There are plenty of people who come in and try and sell you something.  But right off, Rodney Bradham made us feel like he wanted us to understand what we were getting (not an easy task), rather than just slamming in a new system.  That was a pleasant difference from most of the others who came in.\n\nThe second was how long the company had been around.  It isn't much of a surprise to find that there are a lot of companies out there who will sell you just about anything, but Bradham Brothers had been around for a long time - nearly 30 years.  That's a lot longer than many.\n\nSo we went with Bradham, and have been very happy with the decision.  We have only had one time when the system has had a problem, and they responded, came out and fixed it promptly - all covered under the warranty."
1,"Good mexican food at a great price conveniently located near the Charlotte airport.  Simple as it gets.  \n\nService is friendly and food is good.  All of the other reviewers do a good job of explaining the ins and outs of this place, just thought I'd chime in with a solid +1\n\nDon't come expecting fine dining, expect to get good home cooked Mexican food."
1,"I look for a place like this near every airport I visit.  There is bound to be something good and cheap around the corner, apparently pilots are good customers.  Excellent basic tex-mex and really good carnitas too.  I like to get the chile verde with the pork carnitas.  Now my go to Mexican place in Charlotte."
1,"I remember the first time I ate here. It was near my best friend's home, and a huge group of us went one day. I wasn't an adventurous eater then, so I ordered something that looked pretty tame. I had the nacho cheese burritos, with chicken. That was in 2001 and for the past 12 years I have ordered the same thing every time I visit. \n\nThere is a short list of \""must visit\"" places every time we go home, and Miguel's is #1 on that list. When you pull into their gravel parking lot, look past the outside of the building and it's location. When you get inside, look past the decor & the cracked, red vinyl booths. Take a seat (there is no host/hostess, just sit where you want), dive in to the chips and salsa (I could eat their salsa with a spoon!) and get ready to enjoy a truly delicious meal. \n\nThis visit Graham & I both began our meal with a margarita. We were heading to a movie after dinner, so I got a small one. If you're not going to sit through a three hour, really depressing musical (Les Miserables... really good, though) order a pitcher. They had them on special that night and it the pitcher was cheaper than what we spent on the drinks we ordered. Graham thought his was weak, and ordered an extra shot of tequila, I thought mine was perfect. \n\nWe devoured two baskets of chips and salsa while waiting for our meal. Finally, it arrived. We were starving, and of course this was the one time that the service was slow. But our food came out and it was worth the wait. I know the burritos don't look like much... but oh baby.\n\nThe cheese sauce is absolutely delicious, and the inside of the burrito is stuffed with huge chunks of chicken, bell peppers, tomatoes & onions. Every single bite is delicious. I was craving some black beans too, so I ordered a dish on the side. Black beans are usually pretty bland at most restaurants, and these were too. But a spoonful of the delicious salsa and some salt worked wonders. \n\nGraham is a little more diverse in his meal selections than I am. I find something I like, and I tend to stick with it. He typically gets something different each time. This time he ordered the Enchiladas De Chorizo. This was excellent. The chorizo was perfectly cooked and really flavorful. \n\nMiguel's is truly on my list of my favorite restaurants of all time. The food is delicious, the service is quick and the staff is always pleasant. The same people have worked there forever, and back when I still lived in Charlotte and ate there every week, my server would bring me a sweet tea without even asking. And the price absolutely can not be beat. Dinner, margaritas & tip cost us about $42. \n\nThree enchiladas filled with Mexican sausage, covered with shredded cheddar cheese & green sauce. Served with rice, lettuce & pico de gallo."
1,"I think this place is awesome and not because it has my name!! I used to go to CPCC and I would eat here at least 2-3 times a week. The chips and salsa are great and so is almost everything else on the menu. Do not let appearances fool you, this place is special. The price is dirt cheap and the quality is 5 star. The Serrano special is one of the best dishes I have ever had. If in Charlotte you must try this place."
1,"We had the fajitas for two, oh yeah! Perfectly grilled caramelized juicy goodness. Tons of food, definite doggy bag treat for lunch tomorrow. There's plenty variety on the menu to choose whatever you're feeling like. This is the best Mexican food I've had on the East Coast, no doubt in my mind. Quite clean and the patio gives you that dinner-on-the beach\n-while-you're-still-in-your bikini feel. \nThe place started filling up at a good pace after we drove in at about 12:30, so the employees stayed very busy. People seemed to be enjoying the food and atmosphere. A true laid-back, delicious pleasure!"
1,"Being near my office, we frequent this place for lunch. \n\nService: outstanding. Always fast and friendly, with bottomless chips and salsa that actually get refilled.\n\nFood: the food is standard Mexican fare, done simple and well. While you won't find anything truly amazing, everything I've tried has been delicious, well thought out, and ready quickly.\n\nValue: this is where they truly shine. The prices are unbeatable for what you get, and the daily special gets you out the door for about $6, without leaving you hungry. Try whatever is on special that day if you aren't sure, and chances are you'll be pleased."
1,"Great Food, Fast Service! Don't let the looks scare you. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!"
1,Great food!!!  Great service!  Great prices!  Authentic Mexican food in a casual setting. Three of us enjoyed three different entrees and all said we would definitely go back. Was close to the motel we stayed in while waiting for our next morning flight out of CLT.  Wouldn't stay in that motel again but will eat at Miguel's again for sure!
1,"what an amazing restaurant ...quaint, clean and friendly reasonable prices and the food was great with a unique taste.   There was a constant in flow of customers the entire time we were there.  Put it as a don't miss if you are flying out of Charlotte."
1,"This place is great for a great price. Every day there is a special which is a footlong sub for 4 bucks. Also if you get the special that day you can add the extra large drink for 99 cents! The little rock special is a Philly cheese steak with grilled opinions, lettuce, tomato, oil and vinegar and mayo. Yummy. They have many versions of the cheese steak to even include marinara sauce. Okay mouth watering now. Another good one is the little Italy, which is another daily special, basically ham, salami, pepperoni, lettuce, tomato, and oil and vinegar. Oh and opinions but I don't get those. Now if your want some homemade sides like potato or macaroni salad, this ain't your place. They get it at Sams club. However who cares really? The sammich is what matters and of you get the special you don't need a side. They also have chips or fries. Don't feel like a sammich? Well they have other items like pizza and salads. For the cheap price you can't beat this place. I love working on the west side."
1,"After reading the other reviews, I can't understand why they say one thing and yet give them a low \""star\"" grade.  I eat here often - and 99 percent of the time the food and service is wonderful.  You get great food for the money - and service is quick.  However, it does get EXTREMELY busy around 11:00 AM, and if you want a  to-go lunch quickly, you should probably call it in.  Even at their busiest, I've ordered at the counter and not had to wait too awfully long.  Very rarely am I ever disappointed at their food/service.  I like the fact that they have added more hot veggies to their menu."
1,"The Flounder  sandwich and onion rings  at this place will set you free ! Good fresh cooked food..fast , and very reasonable ...even cheap ! I Love it, and go there whenever I'm in Charlotte airport area ! Stays busy, but no wonder ! Try it you'll like it !"
1,"If your're looking for a country breakfast, this is the place!\n\nEggs the way you like them.\nThey serve up a great cup of coffee and an excellent country breakfast.\nThey serve breakfast till 11am.\n\nThey have a good lunch menu too.\nThe Greek salad is one of the best I've ever had.\nBurgers, Cheese Steaks and sandwiches.\n\nThey also have real good sweet tea!\nServing since 1957."
1,"great local business, servers are very attentive and run around like chickens with their heads cut off they are so busy usually. this is a strange little spot but so good. everything i have had from burgers to seafood was a yummy delight. one of these mornings when im not working im going to go over there and have some breakfast!! :) ive heard great things! my only peeve about the restaurant is that they dont have a to go menu..."
1,"Good diner food, great people.  We love this place!"
1,"We hunted and hunted for a good chinese place by our house, and finally noticed China Town. We LOVED it. Great service, the food is super tasty (try the Singapore Chow Mei Fun), and they always throw in a little something extra for us - sometimes soup, sometimes donuts.\n\nLove this place!"
1,"Northwest Family Physicians is the best!  I have been going there for about 10 years or more. Incredible service all around.   Dr. Larsen is my favorite physician ever. He is very personable, friendly, and professional - - and even in these fast times, ALWAYS takes time to listen intently to every concern (even if I have a list) without judgement - a model for all doctors to follow and live up to.  He's very logical and thorough, so I know there is no stone left unturned.  And it's always clear during these discussions that he is up-to-date on the latest in medicine. I moved to Durham, NC, over a year ago and he's still my primary physician!  Wouldn't have it any other way!  Dr. Larsen's nurses are also great - friendly, professional, and very attentive (won't name names - don't want to miss anyone)."
1,Amazing staff and doctor.  I've been seeing Dr. Larsen for years and trust his diagnosis.
1,"Whenever I am out of town for an extended trip I always try to find some local BBQ.  A local recommended Bubba's, and I decided to give it a try.\n\nThe location is nothing pretentious, just your basic hole in the wall BBQ joint.  They do Eastern North Carolina Style BBQ (vinegar and pepper sauce), and they have a red tomato based sauce for chicken and ribs.\n\nI had a combo of chopped pork bbq and a bbq chicken breast quarter.  The chicken was incredible, and the sauce, a little on the spicy side, complimented it very well.  The BBQ was just a little dry and definitely needed sauce, and the vinegar sauce complimented it very well too.  I also had slaw, baked beans, and a small bowl of Brunswick stew.  I wish I had ordered something other than the slaw--I'm sure there are people who like vinegar based cumin seed full slaw, but I prefer mine mayonnaise based--just personal preference.  The beans were exquisite, you could taste the molasses and brown sugar in every bite.  The Brunswick stew was the most different I had ever seen.  It had the consistency of a cross between white chicken chili and chicken and dumplins.  It was quite good and included chicken, tomatoes, lima beans, and corn.  Although it was different it was some of the best I've ever tasted.\n\nIf I were a local I'd definitely be a regular."
1,Drive-thru open 24 hours and the staff is always great.  One of the best McDonalds in the area.
1,LOVE circle G! I live nearby and it's always a great place to get some good ol southern food done right. Prices are super reasonable and portions are hugggge! the service is always great here. They sure do take care of you at the circle G!
1,Great as usual this a most for southern food. I always just trust the waitress (Liz and Christy) and their recommendations and the food is a blast! Not to mention the desserts. This is just a gem. Nice to see all the regulars eating.
1,"Such a great local coffee shop! Delicious pastries and great coffee selections. (They have coffee ice cubes in their iced coffee!) The staff is friendly and there is never a long wait. I uses to live in a city where there was a Starbucks on every corner. When I moved here, I grieved that loss until I found Mountain Island coffee!"
1,"Nurses at the front counter are a little spacey and slow but otherwise this urgent care is just wonderful. I asked the front nurse for some tips on preventing an infection I keep dealing with and she just looked at me blank and said she didn't know. I'm sorry but you're a nurse, how the hell do you work here and not have ANY advice to give me? Thank goodness the doctors and nurses in the back know what's going on. In fact they're some of the nicest I've worked with. Definitely go here if you need to, they're some of the most hospitable and friendly doctors who go above and beyond the call of duty to help."
1,"This is the best restauraunt I have eaten at in Charlotte. The food is really world class. The small 20 table dining room really makes it feel very warm and personable. Chef Bruce Moffett really pays attention to detail when preparing his dishes. Their signature starter in my oppinion are the mussels, very simple, and have always been perfectly cooked. You can't go wrong wrong with any of the main dishes, I especially like the roasted Halibut, and this is a restauraunt worth ordering the chicken dish(pan seared with creamy potatoes, sounds plain but is very delicious). The Veal and Porcini Gnocchi are also worth a try. You can not beat Barrington's for any special occasion."
1,"An absolutely great dinner experience. I went here with coworkers due to other yelp reviews . I got the gnochi and requested to have sausage with it as well. it was absolutely delicious. \n\nAlso, one of my coworkers is a vegetarian and he wasn't too happy with the vegetarian items on the menu. After a brief talk with the waitress, she came back letting us know that the chef will put together a special vegetarian dish for him. This level of dedication to the customer was a big big bonus."
1,"Have only been once so far but it was wonderful.  The restaurant is very intimate, and if I remember correctly, it only has twelve tables.  I made reservations a few weeks in advance just because my schedule is annoyingly tight right now.  Turns out I was lucky as I have heard it can be hard to get if you wait until the last minute.\n\nThe service was essentially perfect, they were attentive and knowledgeable without being intrusive. The pricing wasn't excessive in my opinion and was in line with what I would expect to pay for a very nice dinner out.  If I was going to compare it another restaurant in town it would be Bon Terra, but the intimate setting makes for a different experience here.\n\nI won't go on and on about the food and will just say that we both loved it.  Everything we ordered was better than we expected it to be.  I had the foie gras, the osso bucco, and the re-imagined coconut cream pie.\n\nI would highly recommend this place to my friends and family or anyone looking for a nice place to take a date.  I will definitely be back soon."
1,"When my good friend notified me that Bruce Moffet had recently been recognized as one of the best chefs in Charlotte on the cover of Creative Loafing this month, we just had to eat here.  So we made reservations for 7:00 PM yesterday evening for dinner.  The place was completely full on a Wednesday night if that tells you anything.  You see my good friend and I worked for Bruce in his early restaurant days at Pizza Villa over 20 years ago and were shocked to hear that he bought the place 18 years ago and was recognized as having some of the best food Charlotte has to offer!!  Where does the time go?  Anyway - I had the Pecan crusted pork tenderloin and my friend had the Braised Beef Short Ribs.  He also had the Arugula salad with bleu cheese and we each had the French Onion soup.  All of it was outrageously delicious and we will definitely be returning for a future special occasion.  You will not be disappointed should you choose to visit Barrington's!"
1,"Always a great meal.  The menu changes seasonally, mostly, some of the classics don't change thankfully.  It is a very small dining room and books up quickly so call for a table in advance.  It is consistently good food and service."
1,"The JCC has a great gym. I highly recommend going to Lyn's zumba classes, which are free to all members. She has a strong dance background and she's very energetic and easy to follow."
1,I absolutely love Caribou Coffee especially this location because it's located in the beautiful South Park/ Fox Croft area! The baristas here are super friendly and if your looking for a nice place to study or get work done on your laptop this location is not too noisy it has a beautiful cozy cabin feel to it!
1,"Love going to this place. Excellent burgers and wings. Make sure to get the wings charred. Service was great especially by Jordan and Kaitlin, they went above and beyond to make sure our drinks were filled and our food was good. Go here if your looking for great food, awesome atmosphere and great service. Will certainly try to go here every week if I could!"
1,"I had my first ever eye exam at Providence Eye & Laser Specialists, and they were absolutely incredible. Everyone there was extremely patient and pleasant. They walked me through the entire process, and I believe I received excellent care. Dr. Engle was excellent, and I look forward to continuing to work with Providence Eye. I never imagined that I'd be thrilled about going to an eye doctor, but that is the case with this wonderful office!"
1,"- Excellent staff\n- Excellent service\n- Excellent patient care\n- Excellent technology\n- Excellent EXPERIENCE!\n\nNo doubt about it, Dr. Mozayeni will be my #1 recommendation for anyone considering LASIK surgery."
1,"Best of the best Chuckee's around.   A lot cleaner,  friendlier staff, more games than its counterpart in North Charlotte.  My girls had a ball and enjoyed the variety.  They had appropriate aged game for multiple kids' ages. I think I even saw some grown ups playing games. \n\nCounter person was friendly and even spoke to my girls. Nice pleasant touch. You would be surprised how few people do not speak to children when they work at kid themed venue. \n\nOne wish for improvement would be food service level. We just ordered pizza and cheese bread. It took awhile to get it. Great time for kids to play, but not so much  for parents who were starving.  \n\nOverall, nice outing in a nice area of town. Great Friday evening activity."
1,If your young and live in the Ballantyne/Pineville area this is a great spot! I reccomend Sunday Funday (a collaboration of karaoke/beer pong/pool/darts and great drink specials).  The staff is why I come back! (Jillian/Melissa/Lindsay/ Colleen and many more) The staff is friendly and personable.  It's honestly the Cheers bar of Charlotte. Super laid back and safe!
1,Consistently good food.  Outstanding service.  We love the Wan Fu Scallops and order it often.  Inexpensive bottles of wine are a nice plus.  Their portions are large and it is a cozy place.   Definitely give it a try.
1,Wan Fu is excellent. The food is atypical of your usual Chinese restaurant. They serve an outstanding variety of Chines food. Nothing here is common place.\nThe service is marvelous.
1,One of the best places in Charlotte! The chicken and broccoli was very good! The chicken and shrimp fried rice was good as well. It says 2 people could share one item.....not so sure about that.
1,"Best Chinese restaurant hands down ! Food is always wonderful and wait staff all greet you like your family! You don't have one waitress or waiter - every wait staff will check on you and serve you or clear your table or bring you whatever you need! It's the most friendly hospitable group of waitresses and waiters I've ever encountered! The food is bar none the best. Meals I've had : lettuce wraps, beef chow fun, chicken cashew, chicken lo mein, steak and shrimp asparagus, pineapple chicken, chicken fried rice, shrimp steamers , seafood pan noodles... It's all so good - guarantee you won't be disappointed! Two thumbs way up !"
1,Wan fu is the best Chinese in the area ..I know my Chinese and this is the place to go and we do often . anything they make is great . sa cha scallops. Kung pao chicken . hot and sour soup . the dumpling/pot stickers are the way to start .. And the building its self is a site to see its very fancy'ish but they love the kids !! Lunch specials are cheap
1,"IIt is more expensive than your average Harris Teeter, but that is totally because of the great quality of the food.  I agree with Rebekah, everything is fresh here, probably some of the best produce in town.  Apparently the steaks here are really great, and they have a nice deli with loads of sammies.  I like the juice selection and if I was holding onto a little more money this is where I would always shop.  Better than Earth Fare, better than Trader Joes, straight up."
1,"Go on the weekends for a surprise good time! Free wine tastings, cooking demos and samples, and the coolest butchers around serving up high quality meats!"
1,"Trios is always our go to place when we want a good meal, and a good ambience. \n\nFirst off all of the servers are extremely pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu. The manager usually stops by every table to make sure the experience was great. If you get a salad try their killer dressing. As an entree my absolute favorite is the sea bass at around $16 it is a great value and is an amazing meal! \n\nI really have never had a bad meal at trios but believe me if something is not up to your standards and you let the server know they will go above and beyond to make you happy.\n\nGive it a try."
1,Best Reuben sandwich I have had in the Carolinas! Closest one to my favorite one at Carnegie Deli in NYC.
1,"I love chick-fil-a and I really wish they were in New York. The prices are completely reasonable and the quality of food is so good! It would put McDonalds to shame. \n\nTheir chicken nuggets and strips are so fresh it honestly gets me every time. Additionally, the chick-fil-a sauce is a must try! They have also come out with a honey mustard BBQ sauce which I have to admit is better than the chick-fil-a sauce! I didnt think it was possible but it is. I used to mix the chick-fil-a sauce and BBQ and now with this new sauce they kind of did it for you. Anybody who has been here and tried the chick-fil-a sauce knows why its such a big deal, especially to claim there is something better! \n\nThe staff here was really nice. I found it funny because one of the girls asked us right away where we were from. We answered NY and an employee asked \""Why are you here\"" which my friends and I thought was hilarious. And of course like the New Yorkers we are we teased her for a little like \""should we go back\"" \""you don't want us\"" She seemed to be really embarrassed so playing around with her seemed to ease her up.\n\nOverall, one of my favorite fast food places."
1,Excellent food and service. The staff is very friendly and make you feel like home. I will recommend this please.
1,The food and service here are both great.  Any dish you get will be unique and flavorful.  My favorite is the chicken vindaloo.  Be careful the vindaloo is extremely spicy.  They also have a fairly extensive lunch buffet worth checking out.
1,We have been dining at BG for several years now and it is still the best all around Indian experience we have found in Charlotte.
1,Great Indian food! There is always great food on the buffet. Great for take out or dine in. Kid friendly.
1,"I love the food here!\n\nI have tried many dishes here and everything has been solid.  My favorites being the vindaloo, korma, and palak paneer.  The rice is perfectly seasoned and everything tastes fresh.\n\nI usually get the food to go.  It takes a while but I prefer that everything is made fresh, so I don't mind.  They always give you plenty of rice and will not hold back on heat so be careful what you ask for.\n\nThis is my Indian spot!  I drive 25 minutes for take out and do not seek closer Indian restaurants because I doubt I will find one I like as much as Bombay."
1,"Been coming here for years. Alex, Tiffany, Cathy and all the staff make me feel welcome. The food is always consistent and good. I generally take out but when dining in, the experience is always good. One thing you must do is spend some time looking at their salt water fish tanks. These tanks are incredible and worth visiting the restaurant just to enjoy them."
1,"I've been going to The Great wall of China South for quite a while. The owner Alex and the staff always accommodate to your liking. I am a pescatarian so I don't know how their meats are however I can tell you about a few of their dishes. My all time favorite dish is one of their specialties the \""Crispy Scallops\"". The portion size is very generous & the scallops are sweet. This does not come with any vegetables. I recommend ordering the mixed vegetables with brown sauce. I always tell them to make the sauce spicy :) For appetizers the \""Steamed Veggie Dumplings\"" are amazing with a sweet soy sauce. The \""Crab Rangoon\"" is okay. The \""Spring Rolls\"" are greasy but good. Make sure to have extra napkins. Also I've tried the \""Sa Cha Scallops\"" during lunch and definitely a yummy dish! Although I like it very spicy. The restaurant is always clean and they have stayed consistent on everything for many years. Love this place!! Always keeps me coming back"
1,Since 1985 Great wall has focused on quality and great food. I live about 30 min away now and still come here to eat. Passing at least 10 other Chinese restaurants.
1,I called about 930 and the nice man ordered my food as the last order. I was starving Marvin and they were the only place to stay open and take my order. Such great people. And even better food. Must eat
1,"Went again this past weekend and it's official- I'm in love! Excellent Pad Thai, and their house soups are pretty great too!"
1,Excellent every time. Try the Green Curry
1,Great food for the price.  I enjoyed their vegetarian options especially the pad Thai. Love the inside. Great service as well.
1,First time going and I loved it! Will go again soon. Only complaint was they got our duck orders on medium heat when they were supposed to be mild. But I still liked it
1,"Amazing food and a beautiful atmosphere! I got a delicious coconut dish that tasted like heaven. The sweet tea tastes like green jasmine tea which is a nice new flavor and goes well with the cuisine. However it was really really sweet and they kept refilling our glasses without asking, so be careful because I got a sugar high!"
1,"Exquisite. Beautiful interior, excellent food, and friendly service. Coconut curry shrimp was outstanding. Go. Go now."
1,I've been going to the Thai House about once a month for over a year now. I love it! I've tried a number of other Thai restaurants in the area and this is my favorite.\n\nI often bring friends and no one has ever disliked their meal here. My favorite things to get are the Pho and the Green Curry (which is really spicy). The food is always great. \n\nThe service is even better than the food. They are always prompt and friendly. Most times I am surprised at how fast the food comes out. After going here a while they treat you like family. I would definitely recommend it to others!
1,I ordered delivery this evening and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised at the level of customer service on the phone and at my door. I usually get my Chinese take out from best wok 2 and they pale in comparison to lotus 2. I ordered the exact same things that I usually order from best wok and everything tasted better and was of better quality and was even a little less expensive. I am so happy that I've found a new Chinese take out. And they deliver! Of course its not P.F. Changs. But its well worth what you pay.
1,"As far as fast-food takeout Chinese, I think they are the best in South Charlotte.  Always consistent, always spectacular service & always delicious food; my family eats here at least once a week.  \nMy son devours the Sesame Chicken lunch.  The portion size is a little large for a 5 year old, but that's good because he can make two or three meals out of it.  He prefers their Lo Mein to the fried rice, but that is just his choice.  My parents love the Cashew Chicken and Sacha (?) Chicken.  They always get a double order of fried rice because they love the rice.  I usually change up my order based on what I'm craving.  The tofu & veggies is awesome, as is the beef & onions.  I LOVE their crab rangoons & wonton soup.  In fact, I'm going to order that today!  Oh!  And their egg rolls are great.  \nI highly recommend them.  And Cindy, who works the phones is awesome!  But even if you want to dine in, its nothing fancy but it is clean & plesent."
1,This is one of my favorite places to eat since I was a kid growing up here in Charlotte. \nWe still go there a few times a year as a family when we have a large group together. Great place for birthdays as well. Always seems like the food is consistent and has remained solid over the years. Ingredient quality is much higher than other Hibachi places I have been to. Service is accommodating.  Recently I have been hitting the sushi bar sometimes and we have been very pleased with the nigiri and rolls. We have tried some of the newer sushi places that keep popping up but have realized that we should stick with Nakato's.
1,"Love this place, usually aways busy.  Good Sushi and great Hibachi grill, lobster, chicken, Filet Mignon all great!!"
1,"Lunch here is soo good!  Their house noodles are amazing. They are perfectly spiced and cooked everytime!  Comes with soup, an egg roll, and tea when you eat in.  All for 7.95. So worth it.  I dont even have to order anymore.  I go so often they dont even give me a menu!  One server is much better than the rest , but nothing beats these noodles for me!!!!"
1,"Love the kooka wings! I wish they would bring back the spicy new egland clam chowder! I can just eat appetizers and be happy!. I am a sucker for prime rib, and love getting it blackend! This location is so much better than Rock Hill, it is less busy most of the time"
1,"I was so pleasantly surprised!!\n\nI had such a nice experience at the bar in this ridiculously packed restaurant!  I stopped into outback for dinner because of the Outback Bowl deal - free bloomin' onion with any purchase!  Yes.  Yes, please.  Because it was just me, I didn't call ahead or anything - but hoped for a spot in the bar/seat yourself section.  This place was packed full of people.  And they were like sharks over those booths, so I sat myself at the corner of the bar.  Mandy, the bartender, was very nice - and she didn't give me that \""oh, it's just you? Eating alone? Forever alone?\"" look.  Thank you, Mandy.  \n\nI ordered the outback bowl onion and a Caesar salad with shrimp.  I heard Mandy tell one of the other servers that the bloomin' onions were being picked up left and right in the kitchen, regardless of ticket.  It seemed like Outback was having some trouble with the demand.  Mandy actually flagged down a server with an onion and told her to give it to me.  I really appreciated that!  Sometimes I get skipped or forgotten about when I'm eating out on my own.  Not this time!  Basically, everything was delicious.  Onion was crispy and hot, shrimp Caesar salad was perfect.  I took a to-go box for my onion, and forgot it when I left (like I usually do).  Mandy chased me out the door, onion in hand and asked if I still wanted it!  I know that she was crazy busy in there, taking time like that is impressive!\n\nI'll definitely be back, probably sitting in the shark infested bar section."
1,"So dinner was filet & lobster, asparagus, mushrooms, wedge salad and sweet potato with fresh brewed coffee.  Outback has remarkable servers, delicious food and unbelievable customer service.  No worries mate - best steak in south Charlotte"
1,"Always a pleasure to come here!  Genuinely awesome staff, short wait time, painless  donation process.  I love the ARC and this is my absolute favorite place to donat"
1,Good solid home style food at a very reasonable price served in a place that is quite possibly the friendliest I've ever experienced in CLT... honestly. The overwhelming majority of patrons are on a first name basis with the staff. \n~Mel's diner... renamed Showmars
1,This place has authentic Mexican cuisine. I came here with my sister who has been talking about the wonderful food here.We tried the vegetarian fajitas and Mexican stir fry. Both were delicious. Their tortila chips were served hot and the salsa was a little different but okay. The servers were courteous and the service was pretty quick. I will visit this place again!
1,Went here with my Girlfriend and let me tell you that first off the Customer Service was GREAT ! I mean they was on point.... The food was Great also and I highly recommend.
1,Absolutely best Mexican in Charlotte! The service was prompt. The margarita was amazing! Best wings in Charlotte! The area are large and price is fair. Absolutely love the deck atmosphere. Must eat here frequently!
1,"This is the only place I trust and can depend on to make a delicious-tasting smoothie.  The ingredients are fresh and the staff are SO FRIENDLY.\n\nThey offer a great variety of smoothies ranging from protein shakes to \""bulk-up\"" smoothies, energizing, and smoothies that you can treat as a snack or indulgence.\n\nMy personal favorites are Strawberry Extreme, Grape Expectations II, Peach Slice Plus and Passion Passport."
1,"I agree with the other folks.  I always get the orange (sunrise I think) and it is wonderful.   They also have a great mango smoothie.   IN fact, I like everything in the store.  I will change the name of my dogs to Smoothie and King, that is how much I like this place."
1,"Had lunch today with clients for whom this was their 1st visit.   They were not disappointed!   Over the past 20 years I have dined at Ciro's and have always been treated as a guest in an Italian home.   Yes, the menu has changed over the years but never have I complained about either the quality or value.   Paulo (who plays the accordion) is a hoot--where else in the QCity will you find this?   Sound too tacky for you?   There's a Macaroni Griile across I85 (yuck)."
1,Nick our server was very kind to us! Great service! Fun funny guy! Engaged my entire family! The girls that brought our food out was awesome as well!
1,"When I first moved to Charlotte a few years ago, it was the giggle-inducing name that drew me in: Bojangles--- its just kinda funny in the cute sense :)  \n\nAnyway, on my maiden voyage to Bojangles, I wanted to keep it simple so I can sample the smaller items.  One bite of the fluffy pillow from heaven--also known as buttermilk biscuit, and I nearly went into nirvana!  It was so simple, yet made my taste buds forget Im in public.  I knew I was in love.  I also had the small order of Bo rounds, and because Im a sucker for hash browns, I fell in love all over again.  I greedily ordered another one, just before my last bite ended.  They season it with some sort of fairy dust and it makes all the difference.\nIm also in love with their egg and cheese biscuit.  So greasy and so yummy.  \nIts days like this that I wish I had my own personal bojangles in my basement, and my food order would come through those bank suction thing-ies :D"
1,"3 time repeat customer here and zero complaints!  We own 3 volvos currently and have always had an excellent experience.  The sales department has always been very fair, prompt and upfront.  The services department goes out of there way even staying after hours to see our need are met.  Keep in mind these folks are not magicians but do evrything in their power to see our cars are fixed properly, on time and with minimal impact to our busy schedules."
1,Great coffee and always great service. Drive thru is always fast. Very courteous and welcoming. They also offer wifi with power outlet tables. Never an issue for using your mobile device.
1,"I had my family reunion here recently and was very pleased with the hotel. The banquet staff as well as the sales and catering staff were very helpful and my family reunion was a success. The hotel was extremely busy that weekend so I was very surprised that they were able to a meet our specific request. I did not stay in a room , but my family didn't have any complaints about the room or facilities. They also enjoyed the free parking as well as the close proximity of restaurants and shops.  This hotel is a good alternative to the pricey ones uptown .. you are a short 15 min drive away from most of the major areas of Charlotte."
1,"I have been coming to this location for years and the EVERYTIME it has been amazing. The people are always amazing and friendly.\n\nThe people that work at this location are truly amazing and for that I am thankful. Always there to help you if you have questions about the process \nI bought the sausage - egg and cheese on a toasted plain bagel (definitely suggest)\nand their orange juice...refreshing\n\nBeing from New York, this place is the best place to get a Norther quality breakfast \n\nTheir entire menu is great on the run or to eat in. Especially in the morning it can get busy but the line moves quickly since everyone knows exactly what to do.\n\nWhen I want to eat out for a great breakfast that is good for you, this is the place that I go.\n\n-Wally"
1,"Hickory Grove is the church where I vote and where my daughter plays soccer. My church, http://www.BranchChurch.org is in a rented facility and has no place to do baptisms. HG let us use their facility on a Friday night complete with sound guys... I think that's really cool!"
1,Nice and quiet hotel off the main road a lot of people miss if they not paying attention. Very clean and nice staff.
1,"Well kept secret in University City. Took the kids for a day out. Very affordable prices. $5 for each game per person. 25 cents for the video games. Throwback video games (Pac-Man, Moon Patrol, Donkey Kong, Foosball, Air Hockey). 9 holes of the putt-putt are above ground, the back 9 are underground. The kids thought it was pretty cool. Great spot to get to if you want to get out with the kids or have a date night out with the missus. A+++++ Now that's what's up!!!!"
1,"If you are looking for a bar to go to and just want to have appetizers, beer, and spirits then TGIF's is the place to be! If you are looking for this place to be \""family-friendly\"", than do not sit in the bar area or do not bring children there after 9pm.\n\nI frequent this particular TGIF's a lot, but I only sit in the bar area because I usually plan to only have drinks and appetizers and to enjoy the excitement of the bartenders and the numerous new people I meet there while in the bar.  \n\nI went with a friend on this particular visit to have a girls' night out, have some drinks and have fun! And boy did we definitely have some fun! We ordered the pretzels with the craft beer cheese dipping sauce and chips and salsa as our appetizers. The pretzel appetizer is my favorite and I always get it when I go to TGIF's, the craft beer cheese dipping sauce is very good and is mixed with green onions and bacon pieces. So to wash down the pretzels and chips and salsa we had to order tasty and refreshing drinks. TGIF's has a full service bar and the bar is fully stocked with the best alcohol and they have a wide variety of alcoholic beverages, from the traditional drinks to their signature ones. My friend had an Appletini and I had their signature drink, the Captain Morgan Island Rum Punch. The bartenders there on this night stuck their feet in these drinks, because they were AMAZING! The drinks were not watered down, I could taste the alcohol, and we got our money's worth.\n\nAfter sitting at the bar for awhile, we started to get hungry again, so we ordered an entree and both got the salmon with maison butter, mashed potatoes and the vegetable medley (zucchini, squash and red peppers). It did not take long for our food to come out, our food was hot and very tasty. We ate all of it!\n\nI recommend their bar service to everyone, but do be prepared for it to be crowded, loud and busy, so sit back, grab a drink and have a good time!"
1,"This is the gem of University City. \n\nIt's laid back atmosphere hits you from the parking lot, with acoustic sounds and the tinkling of laughter and wine glasses. At least a dozen tables spill outside the doors, filled with patrons and their cherished pets on any warm evening. It's commonplace to have live music from the patio, but doesn't overpower the conversations or keep the dogs from lounging. The ambiance, especially with the views of the lake and paddle boats, allows you to shift your mind into thinking you're anywhere but a local hangout in the Piedmont of NC. \n\nThe Vault itself has tiny quarters, but stocks some well-treasured and fresh names, both in wine and brews. Snacks are available, with a varied assortment of cheeses, pretzels and party mix. It's very simple to walk in, make your selections, then take to the register for purchase. The only problem you may find are long lines, so I wouldn't wait until the last minute for a drink or the bathroom. \n\nIt's worth a drive from anywhere in the Charlotte area to see what the UCB has been keeping to itself. This place is equally impressive for the intimate conversation of a first date, relaxing with a group of friends after work, or bringing your dog for some appreciative petting from strangers. If you're single, the last one is especially fun."
1,"I absolutely love this little hang out. This is the best place in the area (and among my top pics in the city) for a casual date with friends. The prices are reasonable, the live music is fun, and the dogs are cute. \n\nThe atmosphere of the Wine Vault is always nice regardless of what you're looking for. If you're in the mood for a little revelry with whoever may be passing by, grab a table close to the center. If a little more room to breath and a little less volume is what you are after, just grab a table around the outer edges.\n\nI have to admit that this place doesn't come to mind too much during the winter; but every summer the Wine Vault manages to stay on my ever-changing list of places that I want to be."
1,"I....am a wine snob. So having said that, I love this little wine boutique. Very comfortable and inviting interior. Comfortable patio area for nice days. A very good selection of wines from all price and taste ranges. Daily varied offerings of wine by the glass or you can hunt through their wine walls for a bottle of your choosing. A little chilled something available for the beer and bubbly drinkers. Great location and atmosphere."
1,I decided to try Sports Clips this week as I am tired of receiving mediocre haircuts for $35 or more. I am now a big fan. \n\nAshley did a great job on my hair and I am very happy with the result. On top of that she is actually happy to be working here and her positive attitude carriers over into her customer's experience. If you are tired of over paying for your haircut give this place a try.
1,I have been to this Taco Bell couple of times with my family. The staff is very friendly. Lot of veg verity is available for vegetarians.
1,"This is my favorite place in charlotte, with my grandmothers nursing home across the street and me traveling all the time on an fixed amount to spend per city it's great too just sit by the pond and people watch."
1,Love the stackable 7-layered chocolate cake
1,"I travel a lot for work and this hotel has the nicest staff of any hotel I've ever stayed in! Very thoughtful and respectful people working here. Dinners are complimentary to hotels guests Monday - Thursday. All homemade, all delicious. \n\nRooms are very clean and spacious. The beds were extremely comfortable and full of high quality pillows. I will definitely be staying here again!"
1,"I have stayed here on a number of occassions while working nearby. Don't let the affordable pricing fool you, this place is very clean, quiet, and safe.  The staff is friendly, the hotel is located near plenty of places to eat, and lots of restaurants nearby that deliver. I would have probably chosen 4.5 stars if there was a option, as the property is showing its age a little, however with the amount of hotels I have stayed in over my career, the staff does a very good job at keeping it clean and looking good."
1,"What a terrific experience for a really crappy situation.  I bought a used car yesterday and the A/C was working fine.  Today I take it for a ride (about 15 minutes) and hot air is blowing out.  I bring it to this Meineke and...bad news.  The compressor is not coming on which is a $500 repair.  Josh, the guy behind the counter, tells me that he will not charge me for anything if I just want to stop diagnostic services and take the car home.  He also gives me a quote to keep going to see if there is something else going on.  I take that option and hope for a miracle.  \n\nAfter hooking it up to \""the machine\"" and putting some dye through the system, he finds out there is also a leak. He gives me a quote for the new part which he would need to order.  I decide to take it (about $175 for the part and labor).  He got the part same day and fixed the A/C.  He explained everything to me with a diagram and showed me exactly what was wrong and what he was going to fix.  He also was very upfront and shared that while although the A/C is running cold now the compressor will eventually need to be replaced because it is damaged.\n\nMy only disappointment was that it took nearly 5 hours of me sitting there and waiting.  However, I was a walk-in with no appointment and he had to go get a part for me.  \n\nOn a side note, I did really appreciate him helping me get my laptop connected to an outlet.  I needed a three prong outlet and there were none around me.  He went into the shop and brought out an extension cord, hooked it up behind the desk and got me situated.  Honestly, I'm going back here for any other services I need.  I really do trust, Josh.  He did not push me to go forward with fixing it because he was not 100% sure it would work.  He also thanked me at the end for my patience because he realized how long I had been sitting there.  Small thing - but that's what us Yelpers look for when we give 5 stars!"
1,"Is it sad that one of the fantasies I harbor closest to my heart is to be on NPR someday? I LOVE NPR, and Charlotte's station is as good as it gets. When I'm traveling, I get really pissy when I get out of range...all NPR is good stuff, but I know when all the programs will be on my local one, and I'm familiar with all their voices.\n\nTheir coverage of local issues is top-notch, like all the recent information on the bailouts, the Wachovia failure, and the impact on our local economy. I haven't found anywhere else to get this kind of detailed, nuanced information in the Charlotte media. Charlotte Talks is awesome. \n\nThey also do a great job of covering local events. I hear more about what's coming up in the community from the little mentions in NPR than anywhere else on television, print, or online...and certainly more than other radio stations.\n\nI know I'm becoming an old lady when I don't know what's hot on the radio, but I can tell you what's hot on NPR...Sigh."
1,"Early bird special Sun thru Thurs from 5pm till 6pm, $11.95. Ichiban! DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYTHING ELSE AFTER 6PM."
1,"I was very impressed with Nakato. We went on a Friday night, and it was pretty busy. My girlfriend and I ordered sushi at the sushi bar, along with gyoza appetizer and some fried rice. The sushi was very fresh and flavorful (I had a Carolina roll as well as a spicy tuna roll, and they were great!). The gyoza was on point, and the fried rice was done right. I will be coming back here again!"
1,"Me and wife love this place. It is our favorite Sushi place. Love the atmoshere, the decore, the staff, the hot towels, and of course the food. They have a beverage and a sushi bar. This is also a Japenese Steak House, but we mostly come here for the sushi. They have 16 Teppanyaki Tables in the main dinning room and 4 more tables in private roomd that you do not need a reservation for, but you have to take your shoes off and sit on the floor."
1,I can't say enough about the service here. We had an issue the manager came right out apologized and gave us a free meal.. I will be back..
1,"We dined here for lunch.  It was not a busy, but every thing was great from the food to the service.  We all enjoyed the hibachi and the sauces were excellent!"
1,We stayed here after a long flight back from Aruba and had wanted a nicer hotel to stay at.\n\nWe chose the Drury due to the reviews we saw about the 'added' perks. The popcorn/soda and movies they show in the evenings as well as 'happy hour' with free drinks & food. We came too late to enjoy some of those perks but it was a nice stay overall. The rooms were decent with free wifi.\n\nThe breakfast was above average and was very crowded. There was a huge line (unsure if we had a few groups staying there or what).\n\nWould recommend.
1,best chinese food! people that work here are so nice!
1,"I was looking for a Chinese food cater for a small group party. Lotus catered a couple of friends' wedding so I called them to give it a try, though I had not been there before. Linda was super nice and she definitely knows how to do catering business and make her customers happy. I ordered fan fried dumplings and chicken wings. They were delicious. My guests were happy with the food too. Linda not only asked if I needed extra paper products and dipping sauces also followed up and asked how the food was. Linda was also very flexible with order amount and offered great prices for my orders. Great experience, also cater!"
1,"Oh Kohls, why do you torment me with all the 20% off coupons you incessantly send me and the non stop sales? Good grief, last week you offered $15 in bonus bucks for every $50 spent. So hard to resist...but I must! Can't fit much more into my closet. Perhaps I can just drop another dress size and start over.\n\nYou would think with all the money I save I could buy a bigger house, but it hasn't quite worked out that way. Something's gotta give - see you soon!"
1,"This is a perfectly awesome sports bar.\n\nYou can go there for any big game for any sport, and they will have it on one of their many screens WITH SOUND!!  They even have a roll-down projection screen towards the rear of the bar that shows the big games as well.\n\nI recently went to Picassos one week night, and ordered a beer and an order of a dozen Cajun Garlic wings w/ranch.  This is a tasty sauce I've had many times so I knew what I was given.  The wings were brought to me pipping hot and the ranch was thick and cold.  There's nothing I despise more than a warm, runny ranch.  The wings were cooked with the perfect amount of crispiness but were not overcooked by any means.  \n\nMy only complaint with the wings is that they are not charred.  I'm sorry to say, but if you're not throwing your wings over an open-flame and charring them at this point then you're simply behind the times.  Plenty of establishments such as Fanz, Hickory Tavern and Mac's throw their wings over a grill before serving them.\n\nIf your looking for a chill and relaxing WEEKDAY evening to watch your favorite team, Picassos is the perfect place.  On football Sundays, Picasso's University is nothing short of perfectly organized mayhem.  Fans often arrived at 11am-11:30am even though their game doesn't kick-off until 1pm!  Furthermore, you are very likely to see a skirmish or a squabble as Sunday day turns into Sunday evening and patrons start to get that liquor courage. \n\nBefore I close, I want to make an important distinction in my rating.  I give Picasso's Sports Cafe as a whole  5-stars.  The staff is always friendly, prompt and efficient.  However, I am not giving their Cajun Garlic Wings 5-stars!  Though their wings are good, there are not \""5-star\"" worthy.  On a scale of 1-10, I'd give them a 7.\n\nAt its soul, this is a classic, American sports-bar.  Good food, done right."
1,"Great food, great service, great atmosphere. I had their buffalo shrimp and it was amazing. They claim to have the meatiest wings, I will be checking that out next time.Love this place,I will be going back soon."
1,"I'm a huge fan of this place.  It's an actual sports bar, in a part of town choking to death on crappy franchise restaurants.  Expect efficient, friendly staff, seriously good pizza and wings, and good drink specials.  It's a busy bar, so if you're looking for a sub-2 minute greet on a Friday night, go to Chili's.  The service at Picasso's is good, but it's not A) a family restaurant, B) a frozen drink/flair/appletini bar, or C) a 'College' bar.  It's a sports bar, so tip well, enjoy the food, and get ready for the bartenders to know your name and your drink the next time you come in."
1,"I'm new to the area and was lucky enough to have this bar across the street from my long stay at the Marriott. Now that I have moved I still come back because the service is outstanding and the pizza is wonderful. If you are looking for a sports bar, this is the one to go to. You won't be disappointed,"
1,"This place has the best chicken wings in town. Hands down. Also the homemade potato chips are a must for when you come to watch whatever game you want. One of the waitresses, Brianna I think is her name, always greets with a cheshire smile and a cold budweiser!"
1,"I was in the charlotte area looking for a motel which would be a great price and be comfortable at the same time, so i stumbled upon this one and then\nAs i soon as i entered the reception area\nThere was very nice person to welcome me.\nVery kindly guided me to my room \nThe room was neat and clean, not noisy at all.\nI did call for help and in about 2 min service arrived, \n\nOver all i had a great experience, and i would recommend it anyone trying to look for stay in the Charlotte area\n\nThanks for the great service"
1,"I give this place 5 stars. My boyfriend and I drive straight through the night to Charlotte and arrived at 9am. We were seeing a concert that night. We explained that we just needed to sleep and would be checking out by midnight. Instead if making us pay for 2 nights (which is what every other place I called wanted) they accommodated us with a smile. :) really means a lot! They even gave us a room on the third floor in the back corner where it was quieter so we could sleep. \n\nConvenient location. The room was clean, the bed was comfy, the price was right and the staff was friendly. If I'm ever back in Charlotte I will for sure stay here."
1,"This hotel was a great stop on our way through North Carolina. The staff is incredibly nice and the hotel is clean and smells fresh.\n\nThey have an awesome \""lending locker\"" I. The front lobby where you use board games, blenders etc.\n\nDefinitely will stay here again!"
1,"I've got to admit this is by far the best vet. I've ever taken my pampered pooch, Justus, to. \n\nEvery two weeks or so Justus and I take a quick trip by Stoney Creek to get his nails trimmed. Justus is a black lab and rottweiler mix, so needless to say he is a very big boy. But that doesn't scare off the stoney creek staff. The staff here handle Justus with genuine love and care. \n\nJustus' favorite groomer, Amanda, always goes above and beyond to make sure that Justus is comfortable by securing Justus, his own private room so that he is not distracted or stressed by  the other dogs and animals in the office. When Amanda comes to take Justus back for his nail dremel Justus is so excited he wags his whole body. For those of you that know how difficult it is to get your dog accustomed to vet visits you can understand how big a deal this is. \n\nJustus actually enjoys going to the vet. And I have no question that he is in great care. The staff is always very tender with his little doggie toes, and caters to his every need. Laying Justus to his side for comfort, the groomers begin to drill down the nail, all the while petting him and talking to him reassuring Justus that he is fine and everything is all right. Justus responds to their kind voices and gentleness by giving the staff kisses once his mani -pedi is complete. Praising him for being still and cooperative the whole time the groomers give Justus water, and a treat as they put back on his leash. Justus is then brought back out to the front and we are on our merry way. \n\nQuick, easy, and painless; our whole visit takes no more than 15 minutes on a busy day. So I'd like to give a great big thank you to all the staff and Stoney Creek Animal Hospital for your awesome customer service and animal care. You've made our vet visits a lot more enjoyable."
1,"Central is my home church and has been for 15 years, so of course I love it. Our pastor is an amazing speaker, my favorite part being that he tells he truth and stands up for it even when he knows he will get a lot of hate mail and a lot of offended people who will leave the church to look for somewhere else where the pastor doesn't step on your toes and hold you accountable. I wouldn't call our music style quite contemporary in that when someone says \""contemporary Christian music\"" I immediately think of Chris Tomlin, Brandon Heath, etc., and it's more of a gospel sound, if you have heard of The Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir our music is pretty much exactly the same. We do have a lot of energy in not only our worship but also some during the sermon. We have wonderful ministries for people of all ages, in church, out in the community, and around the world with our great missions department. The most common drawback for people is how big the church is. With over 8,000 members (I of course don't know exacts), and plenty who are not yet members, it can be overwhelming for someone used to smaller congregations. However we offer a shuttling service for satellite parking at both Providence and Country Day School if you want to skip out on the crowded parking lot, and the bus drops you off right at the front door of our sanctuary. Also if you feel that you can't get connected because of he huge crowd in services here's where our said ministries on campus comes in. We have many different options with Sunday school classes you can attend, not just by age or \""single\"" or \""coues, but also different subjects (which I don't really know off the top of my head). So come check us out, although we are a great place to worship I know it might not be exactly what everyone wants. Well what can I say I LOVE MY CHURCH!!!"
1,"Spirit filled church; outstanding music.  The easiest (and not anywhere close to the whole story) description would be \""Pentacostal Lite\"".  You're not going to see snakes or much in the way of speaking in tongues but if you are interested in a Church where Jesus is the center focus and worship is an active experience then this is the place for you.  Our family took a long time getting to visit here, but after going to many of the placid, dried up services at other places, we found this to be home.  Loran Livingston is Senior Pastor and gifted teacher/speaker/minister.  The choir and musicians are world class and passionate performers."
1,"Best Wok is my favorite Chinese place in Charlotte. A bold claim, as I've been to at least a dozen American Chinese restaurants just in east and south Charlotte alone, but I always come back to this one. Everything tastes just as it should, high quality ingredients, large portions, and its never bland. The moo shu pork is fantastic and their sesame chicken is always crispy without having globs of excess batter. And their lunch combos are enough for two meals. I really can't praise them enough and as Amanda said, if you're not in the mood to wait for a table at New Zealand next door, Best Wok is worth it."
1,Best pizza and wings in the queen city! ! Nice place for a date or hang with friends.  Service is awesome.  I will be back for sure!
1,Our favorite pizza and a great family ownership and atmosphere.  We have a tradition on Friday night we go and pick Julianas Pizza up and the kids as well as mom and dad eat it all!  Also they have homemade coconut cream pie and brownies that are second to none!
1,"Yen is Back! !  !  Gourmet Chinese at its Finest!\n\nBest Chinese in Charlotte!  Best Chinese I have had since the last time I was here!  This is another place \""55\"" introduced me to about three years ago and is one of the few places I want to eat Chinese!  Mr. 1,2 really sold me on this place and told me about the OPEN Kitchen.  Told me to sit at the Bar and talk to Yen as he cooks.  I've been here enough that they know me, though have not sat at the Bar yet.  The \""Bar\"" is your Kitchen-side \""Table\""! \n\nLast Saturday I arrived about 5:45 pm and was warmly welcomed by \""Jean\"" (I'm guessing on the spelling of her name).  This place has a great following and they seemed to know every customer by first names!\n\nI ordered a Stir-fried Chicken dish, one I have never had nor heard of with: Bok Choy, Mushrooms, Peppers and Onions. The Fried Rice was Better than most Fried Rice Entrees of any ethnicity and Egg Drop Soup as good as the Best Egg Drop Soup I have had anywhere!\n\nDining here feels like being a popular family member visiting after a long absence!"
1,"I have been going this HT every since it opened, a long time ago. Good people and good customer service"
1,"Great customer service experience with Chris who works as bagger / cashier. Great attitude, knowledgeable, hard worker."
1,"Short drive to a peaceful getaway. Pack a picnic, grab the pooch, and get ready for a great day.\n\nOne of my latest Mecklenburg County discoveries is McDowell Nature Preserve. I love walking trails and getting absorbed in nature and this place fits the bill nicely. Beautiful, well-kept up place making you feel as though you are miles away from anything when in reality it is minutes from the city. \n\nThere is a great campground to bring your tent and stay the night, a playground for the kiddos, many picnic tables, and plenty of trails to walk for miles. You can even fish, but there are signs posted that say caution because the fish may have a high dosage of mercury. \n\nIf you are planning a reunion, this would probably be a great place to host it. Rent one of the areas, let people camp out, you are right next to the lake to rent kayaks in the spring and summer...you've got yourself one great family gathering spot!\n\nThe Nature Center was closed when I was there, but I'm sure one of these days I'll stop in."
1,"Great place right in the city, which will take you away from all the busy city life. The nature preserve has numerous hiking trails which are marked and some are good 2 to 3 mile loops. It has picnic tables and grills right besides the lake. Great place to take your dogs for a hike or running on the trails."
1,Love the nature trails\nAnd the beautiful picnic areas\nA great place to take the family
1,"So far I've had 2 repairs done here.  My favorite dress shoes finally bit the dust and I had the entire sole replaced on both shoes. The work was high quality, and my shoes are like new. Turnaround was quick, couple days.\n\nI later brought in an old pair of ice hockey skates for restitching.  They restitched the tongue on both skates - a difficult job btw - and I think she only charged me $10. Again, very quick turnaround.\n\nI really like this place. Has kind of an old-school feel. I'm planning to take my Birkenstock sandals in for resoling/recorking soon, since I've been very happy with their previous work. I don't know much about their key-cutting service, but they are good at shoe repair, and I would certainly recommend them for that."
1,Sweet tea and spicy chicken sandwich was yummy! Spicy chicken was actually spicy which was nice. Also criscut fries were seasoned appropriately.
1,Great location great quality food that is always hot and fresh.. Generally this chain is the cleanest most sanitary you can go to so\nQuality is never a question here... Plus the forces always stop and eat here which i guess is another good indication
1,"So, I am not a huge fast food person, however, I grew up with Chic-fil-A and when I have that fast food craving, this is my spot. So, after a few visits, this location is spot on.  Although it is located in Uptown Charlotte and busy ALL the time, they run things so smoothly.  Recently I arrived around 12:30 and the line was long and I almost walked somewhere else, but had a Chic-fil-A craving!!! Literally I was in the line for less than 5 minutes. They have more than 5 people taking orders with mre than 2-3 runners delivering orders smoothly.\nI ordered the 8 piece nugget meal, but really wanted more. Unfortunately my order was already in but they offered I order a separate order for 4 nuggets, not something I thought you could do. I received my drink and stepped to the side to get my ketchup and napkins and my name was called, quick service!\nAs for the food, everything is fresh and delicious. As I mentioned I ordered the nuggets, so good, but the classic chicken sandwich is another great alternative.  I also love the Chic-fil-A sauce and always ask for extra pickles.\nA definite treat and never disappoints!"
1,"I felt compelled to give this place 5 stars because there are a bunch of \""reviewers\"" giving it lesser stars for the dumbest reason.  Sorry, they don't have shrimp burritos.  Sorry, this isn't a sit down resturant.  Its a take out place.  This doesn't take away from the fact that this place makes the best burritos I've ever had.  It is all fresh ingrediants.  It is a fantastic place for lunch.  \n\nBTW have a brain when you write a review on here."
1,I stopped in randomly for lunch the other day and it was great. there was a longer line but thought it must be worth it.  the line moved pretty fast due to the guy behind the register.  he moved the line along with speed and not at the expense of the customer.  funny guy.  the burrito was perfect and delicious.  I will visit Johnny Burrito often when i buy lunch in town.
1,"Friendly service, fresh and delicious food -- A truly local and consistently excellent establishment!"
1,"I have used Muzak for 2 years and am always complimented by my customers on the music we use.  Whenever there has been a reception problem, which is rare, I call them and they have a service person right out.  I pay $40 a month, which is comparative with other satellite services, and am very satisfied with the service.  Yes, there are other satellite services out there but none that can offer in house customer service like Muzak.  Why people are paying over $100/mo for there service is beyond me."
1,"This is a great place for a hike or a trail-ride and very affordable too. I know someone who had a wedding in the barn (yep, she's a horse person).  The barn wedding & reception would have been ok (it's a really nice barn) except that at the time it wasn't air-conditioned and was a litte too warm.   If you are not into barn nuptials, the Greenway still has lots to offer!"
1,"We tent camped,mtn biked,hiked did it all.  Had a big time will be back.\nThe mountainbike trails were awesome.  all the people we met were nice friendly\nhelpful."
1,"What is the best pizza?  New York for sure!  What is the closest you can get to that around here?  Village Pizza!  We order for delivery, take out and eat in the restaurant.  I also order catering for my work.  The owner is super friendly and helpful, willing to work within my budget on catering events.  The buffet is very good with a nice selection of pizza and a nicely filled salad bar with a couple of pastas at the end.  But don't stop there!  Order a sub or entree off the menu.  I have had the meatball sub, stuffed shells and eggplant parmesan.  They are yummy!  Look at the daily specials.  They are a good idea to run by and take dinner home."
1,The original owner has restored our faith in real Italian food. www.villagepizzategacay.com has the whole menu just like before. Ginny Myers is back now since March 1st and doesnt skimp. come on back.
1,"Best pizza in York Co. SO glad the original owners are back. Great food, very reasonable prices, warm and friendly service. Wonderful family restaurant where you can bring the kids for great pizza. Calzones are great. Try the pizza buffet, too. Delish!"
1,Great place to take anyone especially kids um and also delivery is incredible highly recommended
1,"I eat here all the time. The food is really great, the buffet is always full with many different choices that look and taste wonderful. The staff is always very helpful and so nice. They offer a full menu as well as a buffet. The calzones are amazing. I'm not sure how anyone can complain about anything from here as I have always had a great experience."
1,Just moved to Tega Cay area and tried this place.  Great value for your money and Kids eat free on Monday.  I think we found our regular Monday dinner option.   Salad bar was nothing special but the staff kept it very clean and replenished.  Staff was very friendly and accommodating to children.  Pizza/Pasta/salad bar was good and convienent.
1,"I have only gotten air brush spray tans here. They are absolutely wonderful. I have never had a problem being orange or spotty. I will never do a spray booth ever. With the airbrush she can direct the tanning solution to the areas that need it and avoid those that absorb more quickly. \nThey are very professional and friendly. The cost is great compared to the health benefits you get for not tanning in the bed. I have recommended them to many friends. I had one that was in a wedding and needed to fill in a farmers tan, you couldn't tell the difference in the tans!"
1,"Alternative Tan is a gem. It's in a quiet little strip center and it took finding them on Yelp to know they were there. The beds are older, but they are hot. Probably some of the hottest beds I've been in. The staff is incredibly friendly and the owner is refreshing. The packages are available in 3 levels and you pay as you use them. No contracts, no freezing unused account. I'll definitely stick with Alternative Tan."
1,"This is my quick stop for busy days. Its filling, they are fast and always give out free samples. The place is clean and its not costly. Of all the fast food chicken chains they have the best biscuits!!!!"
1,"Yummy yummy. I had one of the best enchiladas from here. The tacos are good too. I was greeted by a very nice lady and they had my food to me in no time. From the outside its not that flattering but inside its so cute, they also have a patio area which is nice during the summer. Their margaritas are great plus the prices are good."
1,We have worked with Kuester Management Group for years and they have always performed exceptionally well for our community. Their Management was very nice to us and was always available to answer our concerns.
1,"The best in family resturants!  Great diverse menu,  wonderful service, and game room for the kids.  I choose this place for a night out with or without kids."
1,"So I have always said this place is like an Adult Toys R Us for Alcoholics.....LOL.  If your looking for a great deal on Alcohol this is the place to go.  Its right over the NC state line in SC, and is HUGE.  They have pretty much everything you can imagine.  And if you use your Debit Card or pay with Cash you get an even better discount.  Just picked up the new Whipped Cream Pinnacle Vodka that everyone has been raving about there.  They always have it in stock while its hard to find at other Alcohol retailers.  I also recommend the Cruzan Black Cherry Rum... it is awesome.  But if you haven't been to Frugals you are missing out.  It can be a load of fun."
1,By far the biggest selection in town in one location. If they don't have it then ask and they will find it.
1,This place is awesome! I am so glad we came here instead. Food was great and service was awesome! Come here if u want some awesome Mexican food!
1,"Very well lit and clean.  I feel safe going to this gas station at any time, even in the middle of the night.  I have never been bothered by panhandlers or solictors like at the other gas stations in the area."
1,"i rarely give five star reviews but for what this restaurant is, it's pretty perfect.  i've only eaten breakfast here (twice in the last three weeks) and the eggs are cooked perfectly, the sourdough toast is made in the kitchen and is delicious, and the bacon was perfectly crispy.  the hashbrowns are the best i've had in a long time - perfectly crispy on the outside and fluffy inside.  the pancakes are huge and light and amazing.  the cinnamon rolls taste just as good as they look.\n\nprices are right on, baked goods are pretty great.  service is fast and friendly - really fast.  i haven't had to wait more than 5 minutes to get my meal.  i might be in the honeymoon phase, but perfectly cooked poached eggs or over easy eggs are hard to come by!  it shouldn't be an anomaly to discover well cooked food, but i suppose it is.  sure it's a \""greasy spoon\"" but how many greasy spoons bake their own bread?  can't recommend this place enough for great breakfasts."
1,This place was excellent. We were a little nervous because it is in a truck stop but the food was absolutely delicious and the service was fast and friendly.
1,"Californians are all about the In-N-Out, where you can get your burger animal style. And the Midwest is all about Culver's, where the Butter Burger is the thing to order.\n\nC. and I ate lunch here on our way between Milwaukee and Mosinee before going to my folks for Christmas. I got a cheddar burger with fries, and C. got the two-piece chicken dinner with mashed potatoes and green beans.\n\nThat's one of the things I love about Culver's. Yes, it's a fast food restaurant. But they also do family restaurant food well. The chicken was good and the green beans really fresh, C. said. Fast food you can feel good about.\n\nI also got a frozen custard, their flavor of the day: Swiss almond Christmas or something like that. Chocolate custard with slivered almonds. Yummo."
1,"Go-to meal: cheddar butter burger, fried cheese curds, and flavor of the day custard.\n\nThe difference between a deluxe burger and cheddar butter burger is that in the deluxe, you'll get American cheese.  And you have to pay 25 cents extra to add lettuce, tomato, etc. to the cheddar butter burger.  File that away in your memory bank."
1,Just seemed to be renovated because I stayed there before and now it's like a different place.  Had a flat screen TV and it looked a lot more modern and was clean!
1,"I was super nervous about using these guys due to the poor reviews, but I have a home warranty and the company chooses who we work with- I didn't have a choice.  I was pleasantly surprised.  We actually had to cancel our first appointment because we were having some major electrical work done that morning and the power was shut off at the time the appointment was supposed to be.  THEY actually called us a little later in the afternoon to find out how things were going and asked when they could send someone out.  They came out on time and got right to work.  The technician was nice and knowledgeable and explained to me that our A/C was shot (bad compressor and burned out wires- we were worried this might be the case after he said it was almost 20 years old).  I was glad to hear he knew about the warranty process and explained how that would all work too.  \n\nSo far, so good.  I'll be sure to update my review when they actually repair or replace the A/C (it's pending approval from the warranty company at the moment).\n\n\nUPDATE: The A/C was installed the same day the warranty company said it came in.  I have nothing to complain about- they did a fast, good job.  The new unit works great and now we can get our floors done (it was too humid without an A/C to have our wood floors stained)."
1,"We went there for the first time yesterday, and I would definitely recommend Spartan Pizza.  Here's why:\n- the crust is thin, crunchy on the bottom, chewy on top\n- the sauce is sweet and savory\n- the cheese is rich and delicious\n- the veggies were fresh and tasty\n\nWe ordered the Canadian bacon deluxe (with onions, green peppers, green & black olives, and mushroom too I think).  The Canadian bacon tasted like real meat and is among the best I've had ... not at all like that heavily processed stuff you usually get at the store.  The CBD is naturally quite salty from the bacon and olives but I like that.\n\nWe also had the small salad which was just iceberg lettuce and tomatoes, but what can you expect for $2?  I'd bet the pizza salad is much better.\n\nThe service was casual and friendly.\n\nIn regards to the atmosphere, we ate in the parlor booth area which is clean enough and family-friendly but quite dated in appearance.  We left through the adjoining room which is a bar that has been added on and is much more modern and was populated by locals drinking and eating dinner around the bar.\n\nI should also note that the plates for eating pizza are plastic.  This is a \""no frills\"" kind of place."
1,Hands down best pizza around. I love the small town feel. As a local you are sure to recognize more than a few diners or staff members when you pick your order up. Everyone who works there is extremely helpful and you are always in and out quickly. \n\nThe pizza is one of a kind and with their unique ranch dressing it is absolutely the best! No room for improvement needed.
1,"Main Moon is hand's down my favorite place to grab Chinese in McFarland, but really anywhere. No matter what time of day, day of the week, or week of the year - it only takes 15 minutes to get your food. Freshly made each time too. Don't order from the pictures, order from you heart. The staff is so friendly, I'm thinking about proposing in the near future, as I hope to be a part of their family like they've been a part of mine. I just can't even talk about the lunch buffet, I'll start tearing up with how amazing the deal is. Andddd, I just shed a tear. Yum yum yum in my tum tum tum. Miss you, Main Moon xoxox"
1,"The fish fry is awesome.  Loved it long time.  The red potatoes with cheese are delish.\n\nIt's carry out but that is fine.\n\nTake it out, pop in a movie and have a brandy old fashion.\n\nThe latinos working their are hot too."
1,"Crandalls has moved to state street, and is now serving authentic Peruvian food! We went there for dinner tonight, and it was fabulous. I highly recommend the cheese empanadas, solterito (fava bean and corn salad), and the chaufa de quinoa (like fried rice but with quinoa)! They make chicha morada, which is a drink made from purple corn, and is super refreshing.\n\nCrandalls is owned by a very sweet family from Peru, and I'm so happy to see that they are now showcasing their roots with their new restaurant!!\n\nThey do still have their famous fish fry, and it looked like the lunch menu has cheese curds and sandwiches as well as ceviche."
1,"Grilled potstickers, moo shu pork, cashew chicken. Yum!!"
1,"Yum!  Party of 7, everyone ordered their own dish and then shared with all.  Started with pot stickers and shrimp ragoon.  Grilled pot stickers were really good, could have just eaten those and been happy.  Appetizers came with a variety of dipping sauces.  Best dishes sampled were crispy orange beef, almond chicken and generals lamb.  Lamb was way tender, excellent choice.  Service was prompt and friendly, great atmosphere.  Ended meal with delicious mango ice cream.  Left happy and very full!"
1,"I love Zimbrick Acura. I love every Zimbrick in the city for that matter. I have never had a bad experience here. I have come here for every little item I needed done and have never felt cheated or had the blanket pulled over my eyes. There have been a few things where I was expecting a HUGE bill for things like the stabilizer for my rear suspension that had been slightly bent. I bought a new one and brought it in thinking well Labor will be $100. Zimbrick got me right in, said it would take an hour, had it out in half an hour and didn't charge me a dime. Another time I have come in expecting to replace all my breaks and rotors and Zimbrick saved me about $300 without having to replace everything. \n\nI have worked with a few guys here and they have ALL been extremely professional and treated me like family. The guy I usually go to even just chats with me about cars and such while i'm having service done. (Mainly getting my oil changed). The facility itself is nothing less than perfection, in my opinion, when it comes to dealerships. It is clean, well layed out, they have a great lounge with a Big Screen TV, leather chairs, FREE WIFI, and the best of all... Free Starbucks Coffee. I have had nothing but great experiences from Zimbrick and not just Zimbrick Acura. However, BECAUSE of Zimbrick Acura I expect to buy another Acura and stay with them for a VERY very long time. Thank you Zimbrick Acura! YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST OF THE BEST.\n\nP.S. When I was having major service done they let me choose what I wanted to drive while I waited for the day.  NOBODY does that. So I had some fun with a brand new TL one day on a secret \""test\"" road Zimbrick European showed me when I was buying my car just off Rimrock Road."
1,"I've stayed here a couple times now.  If I reviewed my first stay if probably would have been 2 or 3 stars. Lucky for them.  \n\nBack to my most recent stay.  It was the best experience ever.  (Second to the Double Tree in Carmel, IN.)  I walked in the lobby around 1PM and was greeted by Bobbie.  He was handling the desk by himself and I explained that we would wait in the lobby until they had a room ready (since we were 2 hours early for check in).  \n\nMy husband was anxious to watch the Bears game so he found a spot in the cozy waiting area with a big screen TV.  Bobbie offered to check us in early and I asked about our accommation request to be near the elevator or an area that would require very little walking.  It appeared that he may have had a challenge with our request.\n\nI explained the huge inconvenience with our last visit.  The lady that checked us in, sent us to one of the farthest rooms along the zig zag cooridor.  AFTER we requested a room that required very little walking (due to traveling with a family member on oxygen) and THAT was the best they could do for us?  My husband was exhausted before he was half way to the room.  Needless to say, he didn't want me to request a \""closer\"" room after that.  This is why I give them my request when I book the room.\n\nFortunately for all of us, the extra planning helped. An extra bonus was that Bobbie ask if I was Priority Club Rewards member.  Well I wasn't, but I planned on asking...and of course it slipped my mind.  Thankfully, because Bobbie asked me about it, I am now a Priority Club member! This is great because we will be coming here a few times a year.  Bobbie was really good about explaining the details of the membership and even let me know how I can get extra points online.\n\nDid I say how great Bobbie was?  Well...he was everywhere!  He hand-delivered our new membership information to our room (with chocolate and a beverage). Whenever he saw me in the lobby, he always asked if there was anything I needed.  He also helped out with the breakfast buffet in the morning.  He literaly was everywhere!  It's not like he was leaning on the counter when I saw him.  No, he was very proactive in genuinely making his guests feel comfortable.  He's definitely a keeper.  \n\nWhenever I'm in the Madison area, I will continue to book at this Staybridge because of my experience and the excellent service that Bobbie provided."
1,"I can't say enough great things about this location in Middleton.  Earlier this year, I had a one-bedroom suite for almost three months.  A family member was in the hospital at UW-Madison during this time and this hotel was more than accommodating for the specific needs in our situation.\n\nI'm not going to go into the specific details of the accommodations partly to protect individual privacy.  The other reason not to get so detailed is simply because I think the staff went so far out of their way that these \""favors\"" may potentially be abused by other guests if they were aware of the extreme kindness.  \n\nAs I mentioned, this hotel offered many special accommodations.  This allowed us to truly  feel like we had a \""home away from home\"".  Most of the staff knew me by name.  They were sensitive to the fact that I had a loved one who was in the hospital and critically ill. I wasn't alone in this, though.  There were many other guests in a similar (if not same) situation as me.  This hotel could be a pilot for partnering up with hospitals in a win, win, win scenario that benefits the hotel, hospital, and the guest/patient.  In addition, I would not be surprised if they have special training for their staff in the area of customer service and handling special accommodations.  \n\nThe manager, Brad, is visible and on-site on a regular basis.  He and his staff organize and manage a social for their guests three nights a week.  The social offers a free meal and drinks (including beer and wine) for a couple hours in the evening. And, as the name describes, it allows their guests an excellent opportunity to socialize.  \n\nThere are several hotel options recommended by UW and we tried three of them.  This one may be five miles away from the main UW hospital, but it is a straight shot along University Avenue.  Now that UW purchased the Best Western Intowner, there is much more of a push with them recommending their newly owned property to UW patients.  The Intowner is fine, but the best thing going for it is how close it is to the hospital. The Staybridge-Middleton, outshines them in so may ways - indoor pool, hot tub, laundry facility, garage, large suites, kitchenettes, socials, breakfast buffet,and most of all...the staff.\n\nUnfortunately, I can not remember all the names of the staff that I would love to thank.  Our housekeeper was perfect.  She cleaned only when we needed it and got to know our preferences.  For instance, she asked if we could use an extra box of Kleenex because she remembered us requesting an extra box the week before.  She always did a great job cleaning and freshening up our room and never invaded our space. \n\nI noticed how well the staff work together as a team and support each other when the need arises.  It's obvious that the staff members are cross-trained to manage various work areas and different shifts.  For instance, I first met Bonnie on the shuttle.  She arrived at UW Hospital to pick me up.  She even showed me a quicker route back to the hotel during rush hour.  During my stay, I also saw Bonnie at the front desk, at the breakfast buffet, in the kitchen area, in the dining area, managing the socials, and even came to our suite to fix the television!  It turned out that the remote needed new batteries - which she was prepared for.\n\nI also feel like I got to know Ana pretty well since she worked the breakfast buffet many mornings.  Between her and Bonnie, I just don't know how they always seem to make everything run so smoothly.  \n\nThere is another lady with short blonde hair (sorry, I can't seem to remember her name)  that always worked the socials.  She was so welcoming and learned what I like to eat and drink.  She even encouraged me to take food \""to-go\""  when I needed to rush back to the hospital.  It was like being with family.\n\nJan, Justin and Bobby are always a pleasure at the front desk.  Not only are they welcoming, but they go out their way to get answers to your questions and take care of any requests.  \n\nMy final comments are definitely not the least important.  During my stay, I noticed that there was a team of about three housekeeping staff members who appeared to have cognitive/mental disabilities.  I was so pleased to see this and know that this hotel and the manager recognize the need to utilize talents that are so often overlooked. There may have been moments of inconvenience for the guests or perhaps mistakes made by these staff members.  However, this is how they learn and become an integral part of society.  I commend Brad Cook for making diversity a priority.\n\nUntil my next stay..."
1,"I came to Madison and tried out this club.  VERY  NICE for the individual price.  A warm pool, lap pool, two hot tubs, cardio/weight room upstairs, weight room downstairs, raquetball courts, you name it.  Had a great workout, and and an awesome protein shake at their smoothy bar on my way out!  Really nice staff too!"
1,Member here for 10 years total--  I love clean! I love being able to walk away from noisy kids and go into another pool since i am a swimmer I like choices. Cool people -- members keep to themselves dont try to interfere with your workout with chit chat  I LOVE THIS !! We are busy working out no talking needed ! Great classes!  Great equipment and you can use other clubs too with their membership win win \nBut umm yeah don't join K? It is hard enough to find parking as it is !\n\nI went astray for a bit I will admit tried the Princeton Club to see what I was missing out on all the hoopla. What I found was old band aides that did not seem to move for days left around the pool and inches of standing water where you are supposed to wring out your suit NASTY !!\n\nI found my way back and like the Prodigal son who returns home after making mistakes I am back and I am happy!!
1,"Somehow amid 18 credits both semesters of my senior year, I also managed to find time to do a whole lotta scrapbooking.  And this place pretty much carries everything and anything you need.  Printed papers, solid papers, pens and markers and pencils, stickers, die-cuts, acid-free adhesives, scissors, punches, and a great selection of albums.  I think they have classes, too, but being the *expert* scrapbooker I am (brushes hair off shoulder), I never checked those out though I'm sure they're a lot of fun.  Their workroom is well-stocked, and (*nerd alert!*) it is really fun & satisfying to lock yourself in a space like that with all the necessary tools and make an entire scrapbook in an evening or afternoon.\n\nMiddleton is really close to Madison/the UW Campus and convenient to get to.  The store is spacious and well laid-out; really, a photo-fanatic's dream!"
1,"Friendly staff...tons of great ideas and products!  I came here after a disappointing experience at Archivers in the same mall.  From now on, I'll happily come here instead!"
1,Great place to chill...  always quiet and can get lots of work done...
1,"1. Great coffee\n2. Good atmosphere for studying, reading and meeting friends\n3. Reliable wifi\n\nTo sum up: Five-stared."
1,"I've been back here several times since my first review, and have been continually impressed with Prairie. The food is always spot on and the atmosphere is so comfortable. The cafe sandwiches take one step towards gourmet--the tuna and egg salads are made in-house with a little twist from the same old. All are served with a choice of side; I favor the black bean and corn salad. Breakfast is no exception to Prairie's perfection--my scrambled eggs with spinach and pesto were fresh and filling. And it's hard to go wrong with any of the real fruit smoothies or coffee drinks. Prairie is exactly the way a cafe should be."
1,"Marvelous little breakfast spot. My husband and I spent the weekend in Middleton and came here twice because it was so good! \n\nReally enjoyed the ambience, ordering at the register and having our food come out to the table. The fair-trade coffee was outstanding, as were the oatmeal with berries and breakfast sandwich. I was particularly blown away by the chocolate croissant, which I couldn't imagine could trump my favorite at Bennison's in Evanston IL but it was deliciously buttery, flakey and had the best chocolate filling I've ever had in pain chocolat! My husband swore that his mocha was the best he's had in his life. Kind of makes us want to move out here!"
1,"Catering service review (my previous review was for their local cafes).\n\nI had to host a breakfast meeting for one of my project teams, and had approximately 25 people attending. The original plan involved me making breakfast for the team... but, due to a last minute change of venue, I realized I wouldn't have access to an appropriate cooking environment (stove/ovens/counter space/etc).\n\nIn a panic, I contacted Blue Plate via their website. I filled-out a catering request, and within a few hours, they replied to say, \""No problem - we can take care of this.\""\n\n+ Great website\n+ Excellent communication\n+ Very prompt assistance\n\nThey called to confirm the order and then e-mailed me a contract. I approved both, and the very next morning, they were onsite, exactly on-time, with an amazing breakfast spread.\n\n+ Scrambled eggs: real, fluffy, not over-cooked, not watery, and very flavorful\n+ Bacon: outstanding. Perfectly roasted. Not fatty. Delicious.\n+ Skillet potatoes: cubed potatoes, perfectly fried and seasoned.\n+ Silver-dollar pancakes: perfectly griddled\n+ Assorted pastries: larger than bite-sized, but not so big as to overwhelm\n+ Hot syrup and butter pats\n+ Fresh fruit tray was delicious - everything was perfectly ripe\n+ Coffee and beverages were excellent as well\n\nThey supplied all of the flatware, disposable plates, napkins, cups, condiments, chaffing dishes, etc. They set-up and tore-down promptly and exactly as expected.\n\n+ Superb staff - very helpful, friendly, and professional\n\nThings couldn't have been any easier or better. Truly top-notch in every respect."
1,"Lori's is a great facility with wonderful, confident and friendly staff.  As a veterinarian,  I am comfortable referring my clients with grooming needs to Lori's Pet Agree!  She and her staff do a thorough and professional job.  The pets enjoy the day care and play time that she has available as well.   Lori's Pet Agree is highly recommended! --Dr. Kristine Collins"
1,If you and your dog want to feel at home this is the place to go. My wife and I were walking through a park of John Nolan dr. Seen a beautiful dog. We got talking to the owner. We asked her where she had her dog groomed at lori's was the place. Next day we had our dogs with us. We stopped at Lori's just to meet and greet and ask a lot of question. Lori said she has been doing this for 20 plus years wow. She said she had one cancellation. We felt very welcomed and were happy with all the answers. We did leave one of our dog Angel for a full spa treatment. We were so happy with the shampoo nail and all other cleanings. We are glad we seen Maggie and her owner that day. I have always believed in supporting local businesses and products thanks again
1,This place is so clean! Love the smoking area. The food is absolutely amazing!!! It is not JUST BAR food it is really great! The staff has always been very friendly as well.
1,"BEST.CREME.BRULEE.EVER!!\n\nAnd the food, the piano bar, the service is ABSOLUTELY to die for.\n\nLouisiannes is the kind of place that you can GENUINELY never go wrong.  It's in an underground cave, very \""Adams Family Values\"" (Ok, isn't it bad that I compare it to a movie), their wine list is VERY extensive, and if you go at ~6ish, there's always the piano man, ready to delect you with a rendition of a bluesy jazzy tune...\n\nWhile I think reservation is HIGHLY recommended (there's like 10 tables at MOST), it just so happens that everytime my husband and I go, we can get in.. Lucky us!!!\n\nSeriously, by far one of the BEST restaurants in Madison (whoops Middleton)."
1,"I don't care about \""ambiance\"" or \""decor\"" anymore.  I hit 40 and it doesn't matter to me anymore.\n\nI am more concerned about food.\n\nThis food is awesome.\n\nGo, it is incredible."
1,"I've been to many restaurants in Middleton, but this is by far my favorite, and for a number of reasons. The food was excellent: I had a scallop and shrimp special. The service was excellent: Seated promptly, waitress prompt, professional and spoke very clearly when it came to the specials. The atmosphere is unique: In the basement of a building, but you wouldn't think so when you're there. Piano player, Great Martini! So when you're in Middleton, I suggest you stop here! (And Marnie is correct on the raspberry vinaigrette dressing with actual raspberries in it!!)"
1,"Was visiting Madison for Epic Training last year and came here with some coworkers.\n\nAWESOME!! Everything I had was delicious. Tried escargot for the first time and it was wonderful. It was drenched in some savory buttery sauce and topped with a puff pastry...OMG. We also tried the crab puffs, they were also delicious.\n\nCan't remember exactly what my entree was but it had bacon in it and was great too. The chocolate creme brulee was lovely.\n\nBack in Madison this week and will be going here tomorrow."
1,"Went again and it was AMAZING as usual. Went with a group of coworkers and we started out with escargot, crab puffs and stuffed mushrooms...YUM\n\nFor the entree's I had some pork masterpiece that was a featured dish and it was divine. For dessert I believe I had the dark chocolate creme brulee again. It was another great experience!"
1,"We had a wonderful experience at Louisianne's. We had reservations for dinner, but happened to be seated next to a rather loud group of men. Since the restaurant was completely full, we asked if we might be able to be seated in the bar area instead (which was much quieter). They quickly accomodated our request and we had an enjoyable conversation throughout dinner. The food was excellent and a musician softly played piano in the background. The service was prompt, helpful, and friendly. Terrific night out!"
1,"My husband took me here in our very first date (7years ago) and every year we make a visit. I am absolutely addicted to their crawfish cheesecake and my goodness the crab puffs are amazing. Every visit I contemplate getting a platter of the crab puffs for myself and no one else. The bartenders have always been outstanding with their recommendations and drink specials and extremely friendly when waiting for your table. I love the atmosphere and the waitresses are usually on point and keep our water glasses full which is my biggest pet peeve. Definitely make this a stop if you enjoy and intimate atmosphere with rich food. I am still keeping it 5 stars despite my one issue which is there has rarely (if any) been a menu change in the 7 years of me eating there. Their nightly/weekly specials --when available are delicious, too!"
1,"I can't stand to sit here and read these horrible reviews. \nWhen my son was receiving treatments for spine/ brain cancer, at UW Hospital, we did not  have many choices at that time of where to stay during and between treatments. My son would become so ill from all the radiation plus chemo, and the radiation treatments were at two 6 hour intervals every day, So we couldn't venture far most days.\nAltho we had spent time at the Ronald McDoanld house, after a time I needed to make my son feel less a patient and more like a celebrity for a day. So I decided to take a paycheck, and chose a day between visits to get a suite at the Marriott West. \nAltho my son had to use a mobile IV unit, and was scarred on his  head from radiation burns, this Marriott was most accomodating and incredible.\nWe had a gorgeous suite, exquistie room service and gracious attentions.\nThese attentions were NOT triggered by my sons illness, but sincerely born from true proffesionalism and great training. \nThis is a beautiful establishment, and I personally cannot stand the voices of spoiled whiners on these previous reviews. \nThis Marriott will hold dear to me always and is worthy of your travel time relaxing time, and most of all your needs no matter to what extent.\nStop being so ridiculously spoiled and realize. \nThis Marriott is above average."
1,"Before I booked here, i was about to stay at a crappy hotel off the highway that look like it was about to fall apart. I just happen to browse online on priceline and got this place book. I was already happy at this point that I am staying at a Marriott because I have always had great experiences at all the Marriotts across the country, but what happens next makes me love this location even more. I am extremly happy I didnt let some of the previous reviews deter me from booking here. When i arrived, my check in process was easy, the front desk was friendly, and I was able to check in early (which I was on a 16 hour drive cross country so i was ready to rest). My room was clean, the bathroom is immaculate, and it had everything i needed. Even the smallest things such as hair dryer, ethernet wire, and the ginger orange smell hair products made this stay VERY pleasant. I wanted to bring my work computer up to my room and the front desk gentleman was very helpful in assisting me with all my questions and helping with the cart so i can take it upstairs. When I travel, I dont expect hotel staff to wait on my hand and feet and I am not a needy guest, as long as they are professional and willing to help when i ask for it, I am satisfied with my stay. I asked for a different coffee maker since it wasnt working and they brought me another right to my room within a few minutes, thats what i call attentive and prompt service. All in all, I highly recommend this Marriottt."
1,"When I was a kid I used to love to go to the Hardware store to go looking at stuff and talk to the nice people that worked there.. WHen I visit this location of Ace I feel I go back in time. \nThey are super nice, super helpful but do not smoother you... They know how to make keys that work ( hard to find these days I have learned). I feel comfortable asking questions here as well. They never treat me like \""Oh you are a girl\"". I think their prices are not too bad and you get much better quality like screw that will not strip etc.. \n Parking is awesome here for people who are handicapped or have  a bad back you can park like right near the door practically.."
1,"A 5 star gem!\n\nI echo Jenny D's comment on the hash brown. Super crispy exterior and moist fluffy inside - it's a piece of art.  My friend and I enjoyed the generous portion of scramble egg ($7.50), and 2 layers blueberry pancake ($5.00). Everything tasted like \""mom's food.\"" Made fresh to order, and very satisfying. \n\nNo frou-frou typical Middleton gimmick. The basic decore, and the down to earth service - the perfect spot to watch regulars enjoy the hearty breakfast."
1,"Went there not knowing what I was in for.  I made an appointment same day and had Ka cut my hair.\n\nHe was exceptional and I am very fussy.\n\nHe took his time, listened closely to what I was looking for and nailed the cut.\n\nHe is quiet, soft spoken and very nice.\n\nMost importantly he does an excellent job of cutting a guy's hair.\n\nAnd for $15.00 you can't ask for anything better.\n\nI went to an expensive \""salon\"" in Madison and the woman did a crap job.  I paid 1/2 the price at this spot and Ka was awesome."
1,I have been getting my hair cut every month for the last few years by Ka at Dick and Arnie's Barbershop. He consistently does a great job. He takes his time even if there are people waiting. It is a good idea to make an appointment even though they take drop-ins. Men's Haircuts cost $16 and usually take 30 minutes.
1,Matt at Bennett's Auto is very knowledgable and skilled with BMW's. I brought my car in and he was able to replace the belt along with my driver-side mirror fixed at the perfect timing and good price. I plan on bringing it back to have my breaks and other things done in the future. I highly recommend Bennett's to anyone who needs work done on your BMW.
1,"My 2001 Audi was having a lot of trouble (AC not working, wiper fluid by deploying, trunk hatch broken) and I went to Zimbrick to have it evaluated-- the bill was over $1000 to have everything replaced. I brought my car over to Dunn's and they quickly realized that a few things needed to be adjusted, and nothing needed to be replaced at all! Could have charged me just short of my previous estimate but the bill was tiny. Earned my trust. And they we're incredibly accommodating with my unaccompdaying schedule. Have been bringing my vehicles here, and recommending heavily, ever since."
1,Gotta give a big THANKS! to this Walgreens.  I found myself there shoeless with an overheated dog and they had no problem letting me come in with the dog to buy some water for him.  It is rare for a big chain store to be so dog and barefoot friendly!
1,"If you like fresh, good, normal food check out the Brunch at Fitzgerald's. The restaurant is a nice break from the \""fancy & eccentric\"" food from other places nearby. Food on brunch buffet is fresh, simple and some of the best I've had on a buffet in the Madison area. I would highly recommended a visit to Fitzgerald's any Sunday morning."
1,"Although people joke that physical movie rental stores are extinct and unnecessary, it's actually really awesome to have one nearby for those days/nights when I'm looking for something good to watch but need a bigger selection than Redbox offers and better options than Netflix or Amazon streaming provide.\n\nThe staff here are very friendly and helpful and the number of movies, TV shows, and video games available for rental is almost overwhelming. Oh, and if you need a snack to eat while watching your rental, they have some good options for that, too.\n\nPrices to rent movies range from free (for kids' movies) to a few bucks for a 5-night rental, but I think they are very fair given the service being provided. Many movies are available for $1, and some are even 2 for $1 (although the latter are mostly what you'd find available to stream through an Amazon Prime account).\n\nThe Wife and I just started using Family Video this past week, but we've already been back a few times and will definitely return soon."
1,"Its Friday night...cold and snowing.   What  is there to do? Head to the Village Green.   Enjoy the Friday fish fry and yes, an ice cold beer.   So lets start with the service.   It was very good.   I walked in at 5:06pm, was immediatly greeted and placed my order within a few minutes.        By 5:10pm I had 3 pieces of hot cod, french fries, 2 hush puppies and coleslaw.   The meal was better then expected and exceeded expectations.   The Village Green is a traditional Wisconsin Tavern that has great service.   I am looking forward to next Friday already!   I forgot to mention that they have a decent selection of on tap beer.   I tried the Winter Skull, pretty smooth!"
1,"If you're looking for a super fancy place, keep looking...this is your typical neighborhood tavern and it made me feel like I was back home in the Milwaukee area.  The best burgers in Madison...hands down!  Good fries and cheese curds too...they had a number of other dishes that sounded yummy too.  Super friendly staff.  We will definitely be back!"
1,"My favorite Madison clothing store by far.  I coveted a pair of gold shoes they had over Christmas ($135!)  and managed to save enough to buy them....totally worth it!!  They are italian leather and SO beautiful.  Everything else in the store is the same way....it makes me wish I had unlimited funds and could get one of everything.  The guys clothing is fantastic too, although getting your boyfriend to shell out that kind of money to look \""metrosexual\"" is sometimes a challenge. Something nice to keep in mind as well is that they have free alterations on non-sale clothing....I had a pair of jeans done and they actually put the detailing around the bottom back on....AMAZING!  5 stars."
1,"For those that are interested, GVSS has been the single most influential change on my daily lifestyle I ever decided to make. It was a low risk decision given that it's non-invasive compared to any type of surgery. However, I did not anticipate how quickly I would experience the positive impacts. I was a soft contact lens wearer and alternated with glasses. Since going to GVSS, I have far less worries including dry or tired eyes from frequent computer use and travel. I also have the freedom of feeling I will never need to wear glasses or travel with them as a back-up ever again. Unexpectedly, the clarity of vision amazes me including night vision. I also appreciate the fabulous team at Brandon Eyes who always manages to impress."
1,"This is the best Culver's around because it is company owned (not franchised) and they use this store for training new managers, so everyone really knows their job and they are not miserable like most fast food employees.  And the food is almost always perfect."
1,Exceptionally clean with a helpful attendant. Best laundromat experience I've ever had!
1,"Vin Santo rules!  \n\nThis is a great casual restaurant that is owned/operated a local couple.  She can often be found running the front of the house and he is in the kitchen.  Their passion is reflected in the quality of their food and the high level of service provided to their guests.\n\nTheir food is some of the best in the area - they focus on Northern Italian cusine.  It's simple, fresh, and delicious!  They always offer a variety of specials.  \n\nThe portions are huge!  You definitely feel like you are getting your money's worth.  I have never left without leftovers.  \n\nMy favorite dish is the Scampi Gabriella (jumbo shrimp sauteed with garlic, pancetta, and scallions finished with a white wine cream sauce served over linguini).  Awesome!!"
1,"I went here for a friend's graduation dinner. The seating area was filled. We had reservations and they were right on time. The service and level of professionalism was great. The menu is vegan friendly with a few delicious options. I tried a friend's baked eggplant dish and it was by far the best eggplant course I've ever had. Many people in my party ordered the lasagna and loved it. I ordered the pesto and was disappointed. The homemade noodles were good but the pesto didn't have the pop of basil I was hoping for. Despite the pesto sauce, the experience as a whole was great. I would definitely recommend this establishment."
1,"\""Ummm Good. Yummy. Tasty. What is this delicious piece? Do you wanna try this? It's good.\""\n\nThose are pretty much what my bf and I said to each other during our Valentine's day dinner. No footsies or romantic hand holding but just shuffling forks with an extreme eager to try each other's plate. Vin Santo is THAT good. \n\nI got seafood Ravioli with pine nuts, which completely blew me away. It is by far the best Italian food I've ever had. They made their own bread: crisp and tender. Their Tiramisu will brighten up all of your taste bulbs. Appetizers and desserts are made for sharing, so be friendly to each other, less conservative and share. Go make a reservation now. You'll love this place."
1,"This is a wonderful family-owned Italian restaurant, probably the best Italian food I've ever had. Definitely the best in Dane County! Get the pasta almatriciana, it's to die for."
1,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Middleton. The hostess and servers are friendly, and the food is delicious. Entrees are large and flavorful. Salads are also large and fresh. Salad is not included with an entree, but if you decide to add one to your order, I suggest splitting it. The salad is large enough to be a meal for some folks. \n\nFor an entree, I highly recommend the scampi diavalio. It's a heavenly dish with campanelle pasta, sausage, chicken, shrimp, bell peppers, onions, and olive oil. There are also some red pepper flakes to add a spicy kick, but the spice is definitely not overpowering to my taste. \n\nOverall, this is a wonderful local restaurant with a cozy, friendly atmosphere and great food. I highly recommend it."
1,Visiting town w work.\nWanted a good meal.\nFood and atmosphere were excellent.\nI will visit again when back in town
1,"I took my extended family of 7 here for a special dinner to Vin Santos and it was perfect. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and prompt with our drinks and food. We had mussels as an app., and the only complaint was that we should have ordered 2 of them. Yum. The best meal ordered at the table was a pasta with goat cheese over a tomato base sauce - Fresh campenelli with toamto basil sauce with goat cheese and toasted pine nuts. Lasagna was good, seafood was tasty, and the other pasta dish we ordered was terrific."
1,"C's is a FANTASTIC place for breakfast. Family owned, this restaurant makes all the breads, buns, pies, and bakery in house. I had the eggs benedict and was pleased to be given a choice of ham or turkey, but of course I had to try the more traditional ham. I also made my hashbrowns \""C's hashbrowns\"" by adding cheddar cheese and onions. The eggs benedict was delicious, the hollandaise sauce was also homemade and was the best I have ever had and the freshly thick shredded hashbrowns were very tasty and not greasy! C's was busy on this Sunday morning, but the service was quick, friendly, and delightful. C's has quickly become a favorite for Sunday breakfast."
1,"Get out!\n(No seriously... get out.)\nNothing beats a brew in one of Madison's best beer gardens. With a shady roof overhead (love that newer addition) and tables for you and an army of your friends, this is quickly becoming my fave locale for keeping hydrated."
1,My favorite microbrew that I have ever been to.  Having lived nearby for many years I frequented this place as my favorite in Madison.  \n\nThe beer are all good with my favorites being the Maibock and Autumnal Fire (Eisphyre) if it is available. \n\nFor those that prefer lighter beers the amber or supper club are wonderful too.  \n\nThey don't sell food on site but numerous neighborhood restaurants in the area are available for delivery.  Another option would be to use the grills on the patio which the brewery owns. \n\nLive music nights outside are worth a stop since they are free.  Local bands/people play.
1,"AS far as libraries go, this one is a keeper.  Beautiful building, great selection, and lots of space to work or read.  I can't complain."
1,I love this place. The fried dumplings are to die for.
1,"Every time my boyfriend and I eat here, it has been great. We really enjoy the steamed dumplings and hot and sour soup. The staff is very friendly, too."
1,Best chinese I've found so far. Hot and sour soup and their won ton soup are fantastic. Sometimes I'll go and just get the soup.
1,"Awesome place to go. Their motto says it all, \""little place, big flavors\"" or something like that. It's just really really good."
1,"Food is insanely good.  Fresh meats and very, very tasty.  When you order a sandwich (i recommend the godfather I or II), the owner goes to the fridge and begins slicing cuts for your sub.  Doesn't get much fresher than that.  They have a few tables, but I've never eaten there so I cannot comment on the service but they are always friendly when I order take out.  In addition to a plethora of sandwich options there are italian dishes as well.  I've had the lasagna which was a large, flavorful portion.  Desserts are great too.  Try a Cannoli."
1,"Finally went to Deli Roma yesterday and so glad i did. I've been meaning to go for a while but, always forget about it because of it's location. It's small but cool at the same time. All the Italian nostalgia in there is fun to look at while you wait.\n\nWe got a veggie muffaletta, grilled panini, and a Chicago style Vienna all beef hot dog.\n\nVeggie Muffaletta ($5.25)~ Wow! So much flavor with the olives, 2 kinds of cheese, and the in house olive dressing. Served on a 5\"" round Pane Mariano bread (my new favorite bread). Great price for a huge sandwich.\n\nGrilled Panini ($6.49)~ It was the panini of the week, not sure what it was. It had 2 kinds of meat( ham and salami i believe) and cheese. The focaccia bread was grilled to perfection. We got the order to go and it was still super hot when we got home! Tasty sandwich with a TON of meat in there!\n\nChicago style Vienna all beef hot dog ($2.75)~ Very good dog with all the fixings. Only complaint was that it was not very warm but that's OK with a hot dog i guess.\n\nIf you can find this place you need to go! The mailman was eating lunch when we were there. I always think if the mailman eats there, you know it's good!"
1,Food was amazing!!! Just wish it were open on Sunday :)
1,This place is the best. Americano is ridiculously good.
1,"This is just a tiny restaurant with a real family feel. We came for a late breakfast on a Sunday. The waitstaff were quick to help us. We chose seats at the counter. There were many specials, breakfast, lunch, soups, biscuits and gravy, lots of diner food. We sat among the regulars and were treated like one of the family. The husband had eggs, hashbrowns and toast-all cooked to perfection. I had a pancake that was huge and so delicious-just like dessert for breakfast. The prices are reasonable, the food plentiful and the atmosphere is very friendly. Nothing fancy, just good food.We will be going back."
1,This is a Sun Prairie tradition.\nLocal folks running a local diner.\n\nThe food is good with very down to earth service.
1,"Great shop! They did my flowers for prom, and I was super satisfied. Awesome customer service, affordable for high school students, and they really support local causes. I would totally recommend."
1,"The most family oriented work out place in town.  We love the indoor family and warm water pools. The nursery staff is excellent. I like that when we come in to drop the kids off at the nursery, they greet us by our first names.  I love the infrared sauna they recently put in. \nOne advice I would give to people who are considering of joining is that you don't have to get the most exclusive membership like gold cove, if you are only going to work out on the machines. We have gold cove, the most expensive membership which allows you to have exclusive access to outdoor water park during summer and most of the group fitness classes offered in the club but we hardly go to group fitness class and hardly go to outdoor water park. The water temperature is still cold even it is 80 degrees out. This past summer, we went to the outdoor water park maybe two- three times the most and stayed out no more than half hour. So, it really isn't worth to have a gold cove unless you know you are looking for specific classes with GC membership. \nThe parking and getting the machine to work out can be a problematic during winter months between 4:30-7:00PM. Sometime, you may have to wait 15-20 minutes for the machine to free. If that's the case, you can go sit in the sauna until some people leave. So, I would suggest go there early in the morning or late in the evening but then if you are bringing along your little ones you run into problems with daycare after nursery is closed. They have a restaurant that offers supposedly healthier food but we never had any luck with the food there. The taste is okay and price is a little bit on the high end for the amount you get."
1,"If you want to sweat, exercise, and have fun they have it all.  They have free weights, universal machines, treadmills, stair climbers, elliptical machines, bikes, a running track, basketball courts, volleyball courts, an indoor soccer field, an indoor pool and outdoor water park, aerobic classes, massage services, personal trainers, racquetball courts, a conference room, a full service bar, a flat grill menu, and probably much more."
1,"Let me start off by saying that you get what you pay for at this facility. Are there cheaper places? Absolutely. However, one really neat thing about this gym is that this reward loyalty- if you stay with them, your rate is locked in and will never change unless you add or upgrade to it. \nThey are constantly building on to it. In fact, we joined in May and they are just now finishing up another addition.  They have a huge selection of group classes at all different times.  They have multiple polls, indoor and out. And let's not forget the water park! Who doesn't love that? Plus, it gives me something fun to do when I babysit. :)\nThe equipment is all in great shape and veg updated.  All Of the cardio equipment has a personal tv.  They play background\nMusic, but not loudly so you can actually hear your own.  I love that this have an indoor track, it's a must for me as I get bored on treadmills.  The Locker rooms and showers are nice.  The staff is always friendly.  For those with kids, they have a daycare for while they workout.  Also, they have a bar/restaurant that serves good food.  So far I've had protein shakes and a salad, all of which were good."
1,"My experience at McV Salon was excellent. Staff is professional, shop is cute, and overall great service for a reasonable price."
1,"MCV is an Este Lauder salon. Actually it is an Aveda salon (same thing).  I love Aveda! It's like a cult that I am in. Aveda only.There's only 3 beauty products I let touch my skin and hair. Este Lauder moisturizer, MAC studio finish concealer, and Aveda shampoo and conditioner. Get the point???? I think I should be in charge of the Este Lauder portfolio or a brand ambassador or something. So enough about the Aveda products, the stylists at MCV really do wonders. Since moving to WI, I made myself home at MCV and have a regular hairdresser who makes my life easier and less stressful. Every four weeks for a trim. The convenience and little text message alerts and reminders that MCV send to my phone to remind me of my appointment are helpful. I have a tendency to forget or not write appointments down. Oh and Kirsten does an amazing job. Such talent.  Highly recommend"
1,Great place for great breakfasts and service. Home cooked and friendly competent staff.
1,"Had our wedding here and it was fantastic! Absolutely loved working with Stacey - she answered all our questions and got back to us in a timely manner. They were totally flexible and the servers/bartenders were phenomenal! We have had nothing but compliments about our wedding, I would recommend Windsor in a heartbeat!\n\nBecause we booked our wedding reception on Friday night we were told we would be receiving a \""complimentary\"" champagne toast. After the wedding though we received a bill charging us for the service fee and gratuity for pouring the champagne. We paid it without any grievances, but it would have been nice if they would have informed us of this when we were going over the preliminary invoice. Other than this minor issue, Windsor was wonderful!"
1,Went to check out the Rodeside Grill for breakfast last Saturday with a group. Most of us haven't been there before but we heard good things from friends and saw the Breakfast menu online and thought we should try it out. \n\nGot a super warm greeting at the door and seated immediately. Had a nice dining area separate from the bar area and was clean an spacious. Our group was rather chatty so it took us a while to order but the waitress was very nice and patient. I got the Southwestern Omelet with pancakes - a little spicy but good. Others in our group got the french toast and one got prime rib and eggs. All were happy. Yummy food and good portions. \n\nCost was decent - and we all got $ off for checking in on Facebook! We were very pleased and are planning on coming back again to try dinner.
1,"We always seem to miss these cheese shops passing through the Dells. We stopped here coming back from Des Plaines in Oct., and it's right off the exit. As you enter there is a display of fudge, but they only want to cut it for you on the way out. Next are all the gadgets and gifts. I got some cool reading glasses, a ghost cheese spreader, body shampoo, a WI shot glass, cheese slicer. We were hosting the upcoming fountain pen meeting and bought a great variety of meats and cheeses. One large beef summer sausage I brought to my thanksgiving hostess. Picked up a cranberry jelly, various crackers. I got to sample all the cheese spreads, and settled on the sharp cheddar. I loved the beef and cheese snack pack because they came in small bites. We left with a few sundries, and of course the fudge. Be prepared to drop at least $100. And this was us restraining ourselves."
1,"Free samples of cheese, cheese spreads, and fudge! As good as it gets! \n\nI love this place. We bought about $15 worth of cheese after being pampered and trying about 10 different types of cheese, 5 types of cheese spreads, and 2 types of fudge. \n\nThe store has tons of Wisconsin favorites, which I suppose is in part of attracting tourists to think that they are purchasing purely \""Wisconsin\"" delicacies!"
1,"This particular location helped me out of a potential issue related to closing on my Madison home; the teller, Shaun, was as professional, helpful, and friendly as they come - he's definitely an asset to Summit.\n\nGritty details:\n36 hours before I was due to close on my Madison home, the title company called me to \""remind\"" me that I needed to have a cashier's check at closing to cover the downpayment and closing costs. That was the first I had heard of needing a cashier's check... when I bought my house in AR, I just wrote a check and things were good.\n\nApparently this title company doesn't accept personal checks, which put me in a bind, because my primary bank account is still with a bank in Arkansas. There was absolutely no way I could get a cashier's check from them in less than 36 hours. Eeek!\n\nI have a savings account, a Visa credit card, and an auto loan with this Summit location, so I visited them to ask for ideas/help. They suggested using my debit card (from AR) to do a cash advance into my Summit savings account, at which point they could generate a cashier's check for me.\n\nI called my AR bank and asked them to raise the daily debit limit; they did it immediately. Summit then ran the cash advance, and presto-changeo, things were golden. Total cost? zero-point-zero! So cool.\n\nI've had nothing but great experiences here, and today continued that streak. I was truly stressed, because I stood to lose my earnest money deposit if the closing would've failed. Shaun and Summit saved the day for me. Thanks!"
1,"Love the drive-through concept (SO much better than Starbucks or McD's!), the coffee, the smoothies and the stickers!  I have a little collection of them.  The staff are always super friendly and patient while I'm making up my indecisive Libra mind.\n\nEdit: they were also extremely accommodating when I picked up coffee there with two vegan friends.  They have a lot of non-dairy, soy-based stuff for the vegans and lactose intolerant among us!  Just one  more reason to love this place."
1,"I got a pedicure for $30 and it was exceptional! Great for the price. It included a hot stone massage, calf massage, and the nail technician did excellent work. I love Myles Nails and the other review was not deserved."
1,"We go here religiously whenever we are craving Chinese take-out (which happens a lot!) I could imagine this place is overlooked but it seriously has some of the best food in town. Service is fast and the food comes out consistently great every time. Order the pork fried rice, you won't regret it."
1,"Best take out Chinese in East Madison.  Food is always fresh and well cooked.  Sometimes you have to make sure they didn't forget the rice - mainly when the woman who typically works the front counter is not there.  I have always found the service to be friendly.  Periodically, I have  even received free chicken dumplings or a soda.  By far the best Moo Shu I have found in Madison after living here for 15 years and trying several of the more upscale places in town.\n\nFYI, there is a small seating area here but it is mainly a takeout place."
1,Great service! in and out very plessant service.  wish i lived closer to this store.. the people in this store were wonderful...
1,Perfectly relaxing ambiance with artistic decor. Friendly staff. Tasty food (had the delicious Turkey BLT today). Wonderfully balance cup of cafe latte (soy and vanilla flavor available).\n\nThey also have a drive-thru option if you're in a hurry.
1,Purchased a groupon for this place.  The service was excellent and the deluxe prime rib sandwich and the chipolte burger were fantastic.  You can bet we will visit again wifalsethout
1,"Cute place, very laid back experience, friendly people! Not to mention my girlfriend's hair looks great! :)"
1,Food is always excellent  service is great and staff are friendly. They have great salads and potions are large. The atmosphere is great and the place is clean.
1,"5 stars just based on the Estee lauder counter. The girls Lisa and Ann are extremely professional with their customers. For example I get courtesy calls reminding me of special limited offers for face cleanser and serums. One time I received a call from Ann that they just received a special shipment of only a handful of gift sets for the holidays and that they could put one on hold for me. Since this stuff is pricey, the associates make sure that your money is well spent. They even help with the fragrances too. Got several men's fragrancees (Polo red, Aqua Di Gio, John Paul Gultier, CK Euphoria, Dolce and Gabana Sport) and complimentary body wash, duffle bags, and trial bottles too. The Boston Store charge card is also nice because you can save on luxury items that never go on sale like cosmetics and fragrance. So all in all I base the ratings just on the two departments I visit most often. This is not the typical department store that I am used to for clothes or shoes since it caters mostly to older folks but that's ok. I don't go to Boston Store for clothes or shoes. Home decor isn't too bad either. Saw several glass Santas and nativity sets that would look great if only I had more space"
1,"Madison's great historic small concert venue.  Lot's of great bands play here.  I saw Weezer on their Pinkerton Tour with Nerf Herder (remember them? The Van Halen Song? Yes, I'm that old)."
1,"I love this place, I really do! No rail so front row is right on the stage. The ambiance here is great and there's some cool bars and restaurants to hang at before the show. Waiting for a reason to come back. (Umphrey's!)"
1,"My family and I have appreciated the services available from Body Harmony for over a decade! We have had acupuncture (Amy Regutti) & massage (Jennifer Crye & Todd Harth) and have found the practitioners of the highest quality. Their knowledge of the body, the interrelated issues and of recources for your health are fantastic.  Beware....these aren't light weight 'feel good all over' type of massages. These are deep tissue rehabilitative type massages.  Best I have had.  You certainly can get a 'feel good' one, but if you need a more therapeutic massage or quality acupunture, this is the place to go."
1,"One of my all time favorite places in Madison;  I like it so much that I had them cater my wedding.  I have been eating at NOTO for at least 20 years, and the food is consistently good.  I always have a hard time deciding what to get... the shrimp etouffee?  A shrimp po' boy with Creole sauce?  Or one of the daily specials like the pecan fish or the Cajun meatballs?  The cornbread is also worth noting for its yumminess."
1,"My boyfriend and I discuss food often and he talked about his place with reverence always.  Well OMG.. it REALLY is special.  A simple chicken poboy made right..  Dipping it into certain soups of the day (curry chicken and creole cheeseburger were my favorites).  We call them dipping sauces (lol) and have even gone so far as to plan a trip to Madison based on the soups that day.  And their etouffe labelled \""too hot to eat\"" actually lives up to its name while still retaining seriously good flavor is another rare find indeed."
1,"Good food for a good price...\n\nI finally got to try out the New Orleans Take Out Restaurant and was fairly impressed. The wife and I split an order of etoufee and black beans and rice. It was plenty of food. Nothing too fancy, but it was tasty. I will definitely be going back and will hopefully try out a poboy and some of their other dishes. . \n\nFor the people saying no place to sit. Are you sure you are rating the correct location? They had plenty of tables there complete with copies of the northside news paper, isthmus and the onion."
1,"I've been taking my dog to Dr. Nothnagel for 4 years, and have been consistently impressed with the level of care she receives.  My dog is a relatively high-strung German shepherd, and the vet is always calm and relaxed with her, which helps the dog be calm and relaxed as well.  I have found the cost of services to be reasonable and the office staff always explains the charges if I have questions.  They have even sent prescriptions for human-equivalent medications to Walgreen's for me so that I can save money."
1,"o.k. it is Pedros, but the baked Friday night fish is the best I had in Madison.  Great texture, spices, the rye bread, chipotle sauce and coleslaw were great too.   Of course the freshly baked tortillas were fattening and awesome.  The atmoshpere is a little off, but a great surpise for Friday fish."
1,"Quick, clean no muss no fuss, keeper!"
1,"Really great value! Best fast food burgers in town, better than culvers. Went on a Thursday and thick burger combo was $6 bucks with tax! Burger was big tasty and messy. Fries we're hot and seasoned nicely.  If your thinking red robin burger without the sit down price tag, come here and you'll be pleasantly surprised :)"
1,"By my calculations, it's cheaper to move long distances using an Enterprise van vs a Uhaul van.  The people at this Enterprise were incredibly helpful and friendly. My van had 200 miles on it and still smelled of new vehicle. Moving still sucks but at least my moving van did not."
1,"Went in today for a quick brake adjustment and to fix a ripped tube and despite being VERY busy I was in and out in under 45 minutes. I've been going to this bike shop for 5 years and I only had one bad experience (with someone who appears to be no longer employed by the shop). Everyone who works here is incredibly helpful and they will never push you to buy any services or products that they don't think you need or that they don't think are good quality. They are super woman friendly, despite being staffed by mostly men, and offer their space on some nights for a women's bike mechanics class (that I've heard of and seen, but never gone to). They built my 3-speed bike from scratch when I first moved here, gave me an excellent price for it, and have helped me to keep it well-maintained. I have had only minor problems with the bike and I put it through a lot of hell. I recommend this shop not just for repairs, but especially for anyone looking to get a well-priced custom bike."
1,"We have our bikes tuned up every spring from the friendly folks at Revolution Cycles, and have always been pleased with the service, quality, and value. Being able to walk there from our home is a plus, too.\n\nA few years back, they even gave my wife a milk crate when we were having trouble finding one for her. Long story short, they're good people."
1,"I've been to a lot of bike shops around Madison, and Revolution is my favorite. \n\nThey're approachable and in support of finding you the safest cheap way to stay riding. They also stand by their tune-ups for the whole season. None of the  \""hey we're actually going to charge you another $50 because we didn't tighten your brakes to your liking.\""\n\nI had my touring bike built through them last year, and all along the way they had resources and words of encouragement. The staff is amazing too. My only regret is that I always have work when their maintenance classes are."
1,"Let me preface this by saying that I'm usually a Burger King guy (I like their mascot better, McDonald's is too funny looking).\n\nHowever, my friend was in town, and I thought, \""why the heck not? live a little!\"" so I brought her here.\n\nOn our way to McDonald's, also known as \""Mickey D's\"" in other areas, I begin to worry that maybe I should have called to reserve a table in advance.\n\nHowever, upon arriving, we were pleasantly surprised to find no line!! \n\nWe did wait a minute or two to be seated, but apparently, this is one of those seat yourself places.  \n\nAs I approached the front, I was immediately mesmerized by their huge selection of burgers. Their menu ranged from McSingles to McDoubles to even McTriples!! They also had a dollar menu consisting of items costing $1.07 after tax. \n\nI decided to go with their house special, The Big Mac, and their seasonal Chicken \""McNugget\"" Pieces.\n\nWhen I opened up my box of chicken nuggets, the pale-golden/yellow skin indicated that it had just came out of the storage unit next to the fryer. \n \nAs the freshness evaporated with every bite, I really began to taste all the other kinds of meat that went into making the nuggets. I think I even tasted some pork, but don't take my word for it. \n\nOh my God and then you have the dipping sauces! These little containers held the perfect blend of artificial sweetener and manufactured taste  \n\nAs I eagerly unwrapped my Big Mac, I was slightly disappointed to find that it wasn't as advertised (the picture on the display made it seem a lot bigger!!). Oh well.\n\nI would really like to commend the chef on making the buns just how I like them, extremely soggy. I was even more impressed that the soggy, limp buns were able to maintain their round form. This is some pretty advanced cooking technique!!\n\nAnyways, as I bit into my Big Mac, the first thing I tasted was the mayo. Actually, it was the only thing I tasted, but it was some damn good mayo. \n\nFinally, if you're watching your waistline, they have a plethora of drink options. Choices like Diet Coke, Diet Coke Zero, Sugar-free Diet Coke Zero, etc... ensures that there's a perfect diet drink for everyone. \n\nPS: Perfect date spot for Valentine's Day. Highly recommended!!"
1,Have been here now for three days. Very good breakfast that is included. Very friendly staff. Great location with easy access. Big rooms and comfortable beds. One of the best three star motels I have been in
1,"She is fantastic! I came her to because my boss recomended her...it's always scary taking your wedding dress to someone...especially when you are on a very tight budget. For our wedding there were two brides so we had two dresses, double scary. She had great customer service. She was also fast...one week we did the initial fitting, the next week final touches and later that week, done, eventhough my dress had a lot of beadwork. She was also honest, if something didn't look like it fit, she would let us know and if something was not needed, she didn't suggest things to get more money out of us."
1,"Darlene is awesome. I had to have my bridesmaid dress taken in in the bust and had to have it done in under a week. Darlene did an awesome job on the alteration and had it done in six days. I paid $45, which seems totally reasonable to me. I'll definitely go back to Darlene for my other alterations and repairs."
1,"Great place for all alterations!  I relocated to Madison from Chicago and needed a place to help me with a bridesmaid's dress fitting.  The dress had a lot of lace, making the alterations slightly more complicated than meets the eye.  \n\nDarlene did a GREAT job.  The dress fits like a glove.  Woo hoo!  I will definitely be back with any future alteration needs."
1,"Truly stellar alteration service. I brought my bridal gown in for alterations: the prices are very reasonable, service is fast and professional--and Darlene is a delight. I will be coming here for all my future alteration needs!"
1,"My only source of transportation for the summer is going to be my bike.  I moved back to WI this past Thursday and brought my bike in to be fixed on Friday.   I had a super helpful employee named Sam.  He checked through the computer and told me that they could take it but I probably wouldn't be able to get it back until next Tues. or possibly Wed.  Long story short, I'm going to be living in my final destination in another city and starting work so those days wouldn't work for me.  I explained this to Sam and he told me he would make sure to keep me informed about my situation and he would do all that he could to get it done by Monday.  Needless to say he called me back 3 hours later and told me that he had fixed my bike and that it was ready to be picked up.  I was floored and very much appreciative at the quality of the job as well as the insanely fast amount of time he fixed it in.  Sam, you're the best.  Williamson Bikes & Fitness... THANK YOU!I"
1,"Consistent, professional & reasonable. They do offer pick up & drop off service. The prices are more on par with other urban areas. I've avoided Klinke like the plague! #smallbusinessesrock Thanks Block!"
1,"I'm from out of town and was looking for a place to have some beer and some good food and this place was excellent.  First of all, the waitress was very kind with great service and helpful advice for a couple \""newbies\"".  The beer selection was great and we got a pitcher of a microbrew for $10, which I thought was a great price.  The burgers were huge and very tasty along with the cheesecurds and fries.  I will definitely visit this place again next time we're in town."
1,"I've been frequenting Dexter's quite often over the past few months (to the tune of around twice per week) and am happy to report that every visit has been absolutely STELLAR.\n\nThere's the obviously excellent beer selection - it's constantly rotating, and it always tastes fresh and wonderful.  The staff really know their beer - if you ever have a question, don't hesitate to ask because they will offer a sample, suggestions, and plenty of information.\n\nThe food has been incredible with every visit.  Sure bets: the hummus platter (wow, that IPA hummus is unreal), the waffle fries, any of the burgers, most of the specials, and of course, the fish fry.\n\nI've had several burgers (The Abbey (with tomato garlic sauce), the Defibrillator (onions, ham, bacon, egg, cheese), and the Patty Melt) - each was delicious, and they cook them exactly to order.\n\nI've had the Santa Fe Chicken salad - wow, those roasted veggies are great.  The soups have also been excellent - I recently had the spicy vegetable and the chili; the chili features a spice that slowly crescendos - by the end of the cup, you're feeling a little of that capsaicin love.\n\nI've had several specials, including a turkey melt and a loaded ham and cheese.\n\nAnd of course, I've had the fish fry several more times and am PLEASED to report that it remains excellent.  The hearty, perfectly applied batter and the flaky fresh cod is among Madison's best.  I will be updating my fish fry review with new pictures and details in the near future.\n\nService has markedly improved - the staff is fast, friendly, and as mentioned, super helpful.  I really enjoy their company - it's great to drop by and sit at the bar or to grab a table and chill for a while.\n\nUPDATE: Dexters = MAJOR WIN\n\nFood = 4.75 stars.  Really great, really consistent\nService = 4.75 stars. Fast, helpful, attentive\nValue = 4.5 stars. Quality is there, so the prices are worth it\nMISC = 5 stars.  Great vibe, great crew, good jukebox - love it\n\n\nSummary: \nI now live about 25 miles from Dexter's, and I don't hesitate to make the drive.  If someone asks, \""feel like grabbing a bite tonight?\"" I'm always happy to recommend Dexter's, even if it means a 30+ minute ride.  It's that good."
1,"Had the gulf shrimp po boy for the first time. I knew Dexter's was great, but now I'm planning to go here every Friday I can! And the beer selection is incredible. Great place with friendly service"
1,"Always a family favorite!  Tastes great, cheap, and filling!"
1,I go here all the time (about 4 times a month) and i have never had a bad meal or bad service.
1,"Yum, yum, yum.  I felt the need to update the restaurant.  Nothing has changed and that is what I love!\n\nConsistency is appreciate when the quality is so high.  I appreciate that their burgers are as special, juicy and flavorful as always.  They are not trying to dress up the place or make things so fancy.  The truth is, they stick to good, simply and quality food.  So thank you for staying the same and staying fabulous."
1,Took a clock in to get fixed and knew nothing about it.  Very helpful and informative; 3 week turnaround.
1,"Best meat in Madison. How do I know this? Have you ever had a Bou burger? If yes, then you know. If no, then go to the Caribou on Johnson."
1,I thought Joyce did a fantastic job with my wedding dress.  It was significantly large when I brought it to her and it fit perfect when I picked it up.  I got more than one comment that it fit like a glove.  She was timely and friendly.
1,"I like this place. The service was prompt with a smile. Everytime I went while visiting Madison the coffee was great. They either have an excellent roaster, or train their staff really well (or both). I  like my coffee to taste like coffee. Not the sugary, foo foo, macha frappa jacka whatever. \n\nSo if you believe that coffee roasting is an art and not a fad, check this place out. It has a great energy too. Local art and jewelry designers are supported there and there is a cozy fireplace! Good post movie date spot"
1,"We really like this place.  Cozy, fireplace, really good coffee.  Some nice paintings on the wall but the one is a myth.  It shows Monona Terrace with the sun setting nearby.  ( I think it is the sun- I forget)  Anyway, the terrace sits toward the north and it would be pretty tough to paint the sun there.  Other than that it is a good painting.  The painting of downtown Madison in the rain is fantastic.   I wonder if I could buy that one?\nEnjoy the coffee."
1,"Absolutely best coffee in Madison, topped with a healthy serving of excellent service. Ambiance is perfect for studying (this is, in fact, my second home), hanging out with friends, reading a book by the fire, or conducting a business meeting. They have an excellent assortment of drinks (caffeinated and not) and food.\nSkip the poor-tasting, cookie-cutter Starbucks and experience some real coffee made by people who actually take pride in their job... and check out the latte art before you put your lid on--they're getting good! :)"
1,"I was on the east side for the evening and saw Cool Beans. I remembered I had a coupon and decided to try them out. The staff was helpful in making my choice of drink, I got the Turtle latte. It was so amazing and the girl and the guy who were working there were friendly as could be. I will be going back! Worth checking out."
1,"I've never been even remotely let down by Monty's.  Is it busy a lot?  Yes.  Are you probably going to have to wait 30 minutes to sit down?  Yes.  Is the service slow because it's so busy?  Yes.  I've never been under the impression that the service is slow because they're incompetent, but just because they're busy.  Besides that, I've never noticed it being *especially* slow... just kind of slow, which doesn't really bother me.\n\nLet me take a moment here to recommend the Meatloaf Sandwich: Get it served cold.  Just trust me here.  Do not get it hot.  I've had it served both ways: Cold, it is a sandwich so delicious that fireworks go off in your head; Warm, it is an open-faced abomination with gravy and mashed potatoes poured all over it.\n\nTheir cheeseburger was surprisingly good (I'd even go so far to say that it's one of the best burgers I've had in Madison).  They had a special entree one evening, \""Cheeseburger Mac & Cheese,\"" which was out of this world.  It really tasted like a cheeseburger over noodles!  They serve a great chef salad, have awesome spicy waffle fries, and I would die 100 times over for the buttermilk biscuits they serve with breakfast.  Their expansive dessert case is as tasty as it is impressive looking.\n\nI was beyond sold on this place one time when I ordered a piece of german chocolate cake for dessert.  It wasn't a piece so much as it was a towering slab.  It was so tall, in fact, that it wasn't until I'd eaten enough of it that I noticed that the waiter (who was wearing a mohawk and kilt) had written, \""Das ist Deutsch\"" in chocolate on the plate.  \n\nI've had questionable service twice: Once was when I reserved a pie for a dinner I was going to and they did not have it when I got there, but tried to placate me by selling me a larger, more expensive pie.  That was after I approached the counter and saw several staff members stare at me for 20 minutes before I was finally helped.  The other time was when I was there for coffee and dessert with friends, and we paid with a card.  The waiter told us, upon picking up the card, \""You know, if you can, you should really give me my tip in cash.  We don't see it on our paychecks for another 2 weeks otherwise.\""  Um...thanks for the advice on how we should tip you.  How about we don't tip you at all?\n\nBut those two experiences aside, nothing has been able to lessen my love of Monty's and all its glory."
1,"Dear Monty's,\n\nI miss you so, so much out here in Boston. We've had quite the long-term relationship: from late-night pie after high school dances, to my stint as a busgirl/counter in the ever-important Sunday brunch rush, your old blue tshirts with \""World's Best Coffee\"" on the back, to dinner before a show at the Barrymore, to my going back each time I'm in town to run into familiar faces. \n\nFor years, Tim and Roma and a large posse have made this tiny former gas station a stalwart in the Madison dining scene. Monty's, you and the Barrymore have rejuvenated Atwood Ave. You, and your vegetarian comfort food, zucchini-potato pancakes, scrambled something-or-other, andes mint cheesecake, chocolate malts (don't ask how much ice cream goes into those, btw. but it's all from the Chocolate Shoppe), muffins, pumpkin bars. I could go on and on. And how. \n\nFor all of you lucky enough to reside around this place, please take advantage. There's nothing like it anywhere else.\n\nSincerely,\nAngelina"
1,"Corned beef hash, please marry me. You come with eggs, fruit, and a delicious biscuit. You are potatoey and oniony and wonderful. \n\nCoconut cream pie, you make my booty more bootylicious. Mmm."
1,"Monty's is obviously a popular and beloved place, judging by the number of reviews, and rightly so. Hard to beat the combination of an old-school setting and really good food. The only knock against it is the crowds, especially for weekend breakfast. But do make an effort to have breakfast there sometime - the donut French toast is fantastic. They also have great pies and desserts, and they do all the diner standards really well."
1,"I have returned again and again for Monty's eggs mornay. When I first ordered it I thought I was getting a typical eggs benedict for breakfast but then something so much better came out. Eggs mornay is eggs benedict made with a mornay sauce instead of hollondaise sauce. The mornay sauce is creamier and peppery! It is so good. I once met a man who ordered a different breakfast but asked for a side of the mornay sauce to dip his potatoes in...that's my kind of breakfast!\n\nI've had their burgers and meatloaf as well, both are equally good but I keep coming back for the eggs mornay! I've also had their red velvet cupcakes which are pretty great too!"
1,"It was our first time visiting Monty's Blue Plate Diner and we will be going back our next time in Madison!\n\nFun atmosphere, great food, nice variety on the menu and not overwhelming, excellent service, AWESOME desserts, great prices...we only wish there was another one close to where we live :)"
1,"I haven't been to Monty's in at least 15 years, so it was really nice to visit Madison and return to find it just as great as I remember.  Great atmosphere and excellent service.  Really excellent service. I had the Blackened Salmon Salad, which was great - I love that they have some healthy options.  My kids opted for pancakes, eggs and bacon - all good.  My husband, who usually comments on how expensive a meal outside McDonald's is, actually made a \""hey reasonable price\"" sort of comment.  That's sayin' something for the value!"
1,"The meatloaf in every form is superb. There are three options, meatless, sandwich, and entree, and they are all 'of the gods.' Absolute favorite place."
1,"I recently visited Madison and went to Monty's.  Monty's is honestly such a great diner.  I especially love their chicken pot pie...very filling and so, so good.  The turkey soup is really yummy as well.  And the pies...absolutely amazing!!  \n\nI really like the feel of the restaurant.  It's a great a place to go to and meet up with friends for sure.  Great service as well!  (Leslie is an awesome server:-)\n\nOverall, a great diner all around.  Highly suggest (especially the desserts!)"
1,"Super Vegan/Vegetarian friendly, and can will accommodate any and all tastes!\n\nThe menu is pretty much impossible to choose from, since there are so many delicious items on it. I usually break down and get one of their awesome burgers. I only travel to Madison once every couple years to visit family, and I frequently think back to how yummy their Walnut veggie patties are.\nMy Grammy always orders a chocolate malt and the waffle fries (which are top-notch). She's 93, and she knows what's up.\nThis is the place to be."
1,"I really loved this restaurant! Homestyle, diner food with a twist - including lots of options for vegetarians. The service was outstanding, as people beyond my primary server helped ensure that my drink was full and needs addressed.\n\nI had the Ultimate Mac, and it sure was ultimate! The best mac n' cheese I've ever had. The portion size was definitely enough for two to share. I tried not to think about the calories that I was consuming when I downed the entire bowl plus the two pieces of garlic bread that came with it."
1,I always try and get here at least once when I go to Madison.  The food is always good.  I love the tofu scramble.  A great mix of traditional diner food with some great healthy alts.
1,"My table ordered: and I sampled it all.\n\n- chicken pot pie with mashed potatoes\n(fantastic, but a bit heavy on the rosemary)\n\n- BLT with red fried potatoes\n(came with Guacamole. Nice surprise and flavor)\n\n- Chicken soup with side salad\n(good homemade taste & look)\n\n- Blueberry Pancakes with bacon\n(Fluffy, moist, loads of berries, crisp bacon)\n\n- French toast with sausage\n(great cinamon sugar, smaller portion, tasty sausage)"
1,"I had attempted to go to Monty's Blue Plate Diner the last time I was in town, but it was so crowded that I was deterred and ended up at Ella's Deli for possibly the worst omelet of my life.  This time, I was determined to wait it out at Monty's for as long as it took - which ended up being only ten minutes at around 11:30 a.m. on a Sunday.  The wait was well worth every second.  My breakfast companion and I had the meatless meatloaf - a melange of carrots and other vegetables, covered in a cashew and sage gravy - and a caponata omelet, filled with a stew of perfectly-cooked, still-easily-recognizable vegetables and a pesto sauce made from basil grown out back.  Each bite of each dish was a delight.  I took home a slice of Reese's peanut butter cheesecake which I am hoping my son will find to be too rich for him because, uh huh!  That means I get to polish it off.  Can't wait to get back to Madison for another go-round at Monty's!"
1,One of my favorite places to eat.   Zucchini Pancakes are awesome!!!  We mostly eat breakfast here but I'm sure lunch and dinner are just as good.
1,"Great food, GREAT service. Highly recommend!"
1,"Great diner with a very creative menu.  You can certainly get your traditional eggs-and-bacon breakfast, or you can opt for a tofu scramble or zucchini potato pancakes.  What more could you ask for?  I have only eaten here for breakfast, but the desserts are tempting, too."
1,"Their banana pie and carrot cake are SUPER!!!!!!!\nand if you happen to buy the whole container, you are required to give a 5-dollar deposit which will be returned if you bring it back.\n\nOh Monty, finally!\nThis morning, though I am still a little bit ill, I came only for you :) (and for me:))\nWaiting for less than 10 minutes, we were seated by the window. A very nice spot. \n\nI decided quickly: I wanted to have a dish of scramble \""something\"" (hahaha, I found this funny, I was wondering what \""something\"" meant. I asked the server and she said it is for broccoli, pepper, some cheese (and God knows what else!-- too many to list! :D) and has no meat (yay!)\nHubby ordered a dish of pesto omelet! Both came with homemade biscuit- I'm in love with this biscuit right away! We enjoyed our brunch soooooooooooo much. \nI told the waiter: The food is excellent! I wanna come back soon!\n\nThe food is a five.\nThe service is a five.\nYes, full score for you, Monty. \n\nSshhhhh, don't forget to also order their coffee and the donut.\nThe coffee is really an eye opener and the donut is ridiculously huge but so GOOD.\n\nMonty has made my Saturday happy! and I really need that after one week of my illness :(\nMahalo, Monty!"
1,"Fabulous, just fabulous. Service is spectacular and food is beyond amazing. The wait was awhile, maybe half an hour or so but totally worth it. The breakfast burrito, salmon hash and potato and zucchini pancakes are delectable."
1,"Meatloaf with red wine gravy and amazing mashed potatoes, followed by the best bumbleberry pie ever. Best place for comfort food. Did I mention the pie??"
1,"Best. Place. EVEEER. \nbeen going there for years and never had a single bad experience. everytime I go there i have higher expectations and they are always met. People here go out of their way to make sure that you like your food, waiters know evrything that goes on a sandwich down to the ingredients of the dressing. Best of all the prices are very reasonable and the atmosphere is so Willy-like. \ndo yourself a favor and try the veggie sandwich, your life will never be the same again! I pretend not to like meatloaf but if someone I'm with orders it, I make sure they don't have any leftovers. that's how good this place is..."
1,"Nice atmosphere and fantastic food!  And I love their gluten free options.  They made things as we ordered them and the service was prompt and friendly.  This is a really nice \""diner\"" with nice decor and a very friendly atmosphere.  The line was very long on Sunday morning but that's the sign of anything good because everyone wanted to eat there.  Nom nom, we'll be back! :)"
1,"Shut your mouth!  Meatloaf of the Gods!  There are three types of meat rolled into this meatloaf.  It comes with a red wine gravy, mashed potatoes and veggies.  All of this for $10.  Yup, a complete, well-rounded, mouth watering meal for just $10.  \n\nThe broccoli was blanched rather than steam.  So it was not mushy.  \n\nThe service is incredible.  The people are friendly and the food comes up fast.  I have nothing but good things to say.  On a date?  With family?  Have a small child?  Check this place out.  \n\nThey get desserts from a local bakery.  The carrot cake is ridiculous.  Are you full from your meal?  Take cake or pie to go.  Seriously, you will not regret a snack for later."
1,"Came in for brunch today and had a very nice experience.  I really like their d\u00e9cor, classic diner style.  I got the Meatloaf and oh my goodness it was so AMAZING! The homemade gravy was to die for!  My friend got the Egg Mornay I didn't try it but it looked delicious.  Our server Eric was also amazing! I will definitely be returning soon, for a first time experience I give five stars! \n\nAs a side note as we were walking out every single employee that we passes said, \""Thank you, have a great day.\"""
1,"Went here last night after an exhausting day taking care of a newborn. Thankfully my baby slept through our entire dinner despite how loud the place is. The decor is simple but spacious and the service is really good and fast. We were seated immediately (on a Saturday night! ) and were served water by the waitress right away. She was friendly and always nearby her customers. My husband had the Mediterranean omelet  (can't remember what It's called). It had feta cheese,  mushrooms and spinach with potatoes on the side and a biscuit.  It was so good I wanted to steal his plate.  I got the meatless meatloaf.  It was very filling and the gravy was good but the  portion was way too big. By the time we were done we had no room for the amazing looking cheesecake. I guess we will have to come back to try dessert.  Oh and the couple next to us ordered an ice cream Sundae, it was ridiculously huge and looked awesome. Good for sharing!  I definitely recommend this once for simple diner food done well."
1,"Big plates of food. Awesome staff. So, so many shake/malt options. \n\nThis is the place I usually come after my flight has landed in Madison. The food isn't aiming to be some crazy, new, cutting edge concoction. It's homey and it's familiar. \n\nI've been to a lot of diners. Not every diner does it right, but this one does. If you want tasty food, and ample servings of it, at a good place then this is the place to go."
1,"Everyone already knows how awesome Monty's Blue Plate Diner is, so I don't have to tell you that. Your carnivore and herbivore friends will love the menu. They source local ingredients, cook \""real\"" food and even bring in local products such as YumButter and create extra, super-duper healthy menu items by partnering with Jon Hinds at Monkey Bar Gym.\n\nHowever, I write this review because I recently ate the most amazing curry dish there. I've been craving it ever since and cannot wait to return. I'm serious, it was a hot, steaming bowl of freshly steamed vegetables with rice and a fantastic curry sauce. I want to eat this every day! Our server even told me that she actually DOES eat this every day and has since they put it on their menu. It was a huge bowl, so I took half of it home with me so I could enjoy a second meal of leftovers. \n\nNow drop everything and order this curry!\n\nAnd order a piece of pie or enjoy an iced sugar cookie, too."
1,"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome!\n\nI had stopped here before just for some desert awhile back, this time it was for some good food.  Stopped here right after work, and was extremely hungry. \n\nOur group of four sat down in a cozy corner booth. A few of us got some seasonal specialty drinks, I tasted each, all were fantastic. I ended up getting the Blue Plate Burger with Fries, so great! Blue Cheese, caramelized onions, lettuce,  and tomato..yum! I was so hungry I ate the whole thing...which is so abnormal for me to finish a whole plate of food..but it was too fantastic to put down. \n\nAfter the filling meal, we ended up getting some desert, a few of us got some ice cream, pie, or a shake...I ended up getting the Orange Cream Shake. It really was great. Not too over overpoweringly orangey, or sweet. It was a perfect balance of both. \n\nThe atmosphere here is great, 50's diner feel, this time of year they had Christmas music playing. Staff all fantastic, our host was so sweet, and our waiter was extremely attentive, and personable."
1,"Jim's completely rocks! John (part owner & tall, friendly guy behind the counter) will take time to talk with you about your wants & needs, and will special order anything you wish. I say this because he did it for me many times over the years that I lived walking distance from the store. Their fresh, Amish turkeys are the best you can get for Thanksgiving. You do need to order those in advance, however. If you don't see what you're looking for in the display case, just ask. He would custom cut a chunk of center sirloin for me - he always had a primal in stock, not frozen. \n\nHe would let me hang out in the lobby and talk meat on Saturday mornings, between customers. I wanted to help out behind the counter, just to learn from the team, but they hire young people to work the counter, and I couldn't take a job as a hobby that someone else needed to get thru school, etc. \n\nLong story short - If you like/love meat, but can't tell a ribeye from a strip, this is the place to go. They will help you make a decision, and how to treat the meat if need be. \n\nRemember - the only stupid question is the one that never gets asked. You needn't worry that you will be looked down upon if you ask a novice grilling question. This is not a pretentious boutique. It's a friendly, helpful business that truly values your business, and they will help you make some killer meat!"
1,I should have left this review back in November when I stayed here with my parents - every time I look through our vacation photos I think about how much fun I had showing them Madison... and how we enjoyed where we stayed just as much.  Pat and Bob and Happy (their dog) were wonderful and their food was amazing.  They make many of the ingredients on their property (fresh maple syrup anyone?).  Would go back in a heartbeat.
1,"This place was wonderful all around. I would return and I would recommend. It is a bit higher price point, but it is such a great space it is worth it. If you are looking to get away, relax, have a romantic weekend, enjoy nature, this is a great place. If you just need a place to sleep you might want something less expensive (unless you can afford it). \n\nThe first floor of the house is very clean and neat, but has a very comfortable and cozy feel. There is a small kitchenette stocked with coffee, tea, cold drinks and lite snacks. If we stayed longer I could see relaxing down there enjoying a glass of wine, playing a game or reading. There is a nice selection of wine available to purchase so you don't even have to go out. \n\nOur room was very nice. King sized bed, robes, our own deck with a great view of the sheep. The bathroom had a big Jacuzzi tub and a large duel-head shower. We enjoyed glasses of champagne on the deck before heading out to explore and hike around their land. \n\nHe had dinner downtown Madison which was an easy drive to and from. When we returned we were happy to have the fireplace in our room and cozied up with some of freshly baked cookies left out for guests. \n\nBreakfast was delicious. Farm fresh eggs from their hen's, herbs from the garden and all the other ingredients were local. We had good conversation with the other couple staying there as well as the owners.\n\nGreat place!"
1,"When I think of \""Hampton Inn,\"" I think budget hotel. The decor at this Hampton Inn certainly did not suggest this. With the dark wood furniture, white sheets, classy black & white photographs accompanying the room numbers, and modern lobby, I felt like I was at a Sheraton or Westin. The staff was friendly and considerate too - we asked for a room that wasn't facing the highway and she took it a step further by giving us a room away from the area with lots of kids.\n\nThe free breakfast was also a step up from your usual continental breakfast - it included sausage and eggs that you can make a biscuit sandwich with, among a variety of other usual items. We didn't get to use their pool but it looked nice from afar. The base price was $119 but we had a 20% off coupon through Orbitz."
1,"The burgers are amazing and ridiculously reasonable! The staff is friendly and attentive. The place is super clean! They do everything right at Players! Good drinks, great lunch specials and awesome service!"
1,"So I've been hearing this joint has one of the \""Best\"" burgers in town. I'm generally reluctant to order a bar burger - they are generally frozen and then cooked to well done. Not at Players - hand pattied in view of the customer. Meat is from the Jennifer Street Market - Right around the corner. \n\nYou want your burger rare - Fine... It's rare... Sha- Freaking- Zam! I think perhaps the only Burger Joint in town that is capable of cooking a burger properly to order. \n\nSandwiches come with pub chips - you can upgrade to fries for a buck... Other stuff like onion rings for $2.  The sides are frozen and then dropped in the fryer. But you are here for the burgers - they are fresh, as is everything on them. The tomato on my burger was actually tasty. My only complaint is the burgers could use a more robust bun... But the fact that Players can properly cook a burger makes this discretion forgivable.\n\nSo go to this locals joint blue collar bar - have a beer, get the drink special and order a freaking burger!"
1,"I have always been a home depot fan, myself, but have recently started to visit Menards more frequently in recent months per request of my handy-man boyfriend. They have always had the products we are in search of and often have great sales that I have taken advantage of from time to time. Recently we went shopping for a project and I picked up a poinsettia for the holidays. When we were checking out the woman at the register asked if I have a cat (I do!) and let me know that poinsettias are very poisonous to cats if they eat them and she would have for my cat to get sick..or worse..because of my holiday decorating. I couldn't be more appreciative! She truly went above and beyond the assistance I usually find at hardware/home improvement stores. Thank you, Thank you!"
1,"The donuts are amazing and super-fattening of course, but then I guess you shouldn't be eating donuts if you are concerned with your weight.\n\nI agree it is by far the best gyros in town, I am originally from Chicago and am used to the quality of gyros found all over Chicagoland, this is cut the same, same thickness, same style, the flavor is similar, but has it's own thing going on. Either way, that Parthenon in Madison is crap, people rave about it, what a joke, they have no clue what good gyros is, take a road trip and go eat at Hubs in Chicago, then you will know finally what great gyros is. In the meantime, if you are stuck in Madison, this is by far the best you will find, don't waste your money and calories elsewhere.\n\nFalafel is good, has it's own unique recipe, works for me.\n\nTan Tan Chicken is very good too, highly spiced, which I like, although not spicy as far as heat is concerned. Comes with an awesome garlic dip, which I've only found in Los Angeles at Zankou Chicken, which by the way is the most incredible middle-eastern chicken ever. They even made a \""Curb Your Enthusiasm\"" episode about it in 2011. If you get out to LA ever, you must go to Zankou and get the Chicken Tarna with the garlic dip, the hummus is also the best ever. Almost enough to make me want to move back to LA. In fact...\n\nAnyway, People's Bakery is truly a gem in Madison, amongst all the questionable eateries, which some say are great, others say bad, this one is clearly a huge winner. And it is a real Mom & Pop, literally they made all the food for me, super friendly, down to Earth, real people who deserve to have your business. Go there now!\n\nP.S. I also liked a bunch of other stuff there, the hummus, side dishes, veggie mezza, etc. Probably can't go wrong with anything there."
1,"great donuts. great gyros.\nand the most adorable owners ever.\njust make sure you aren't in any rush, if you think about ordering food here. still worth visiting."
1,Stopped here a few times for the yummy baklava. I've eaten lunch here once and it was fabulous. I had the tan-tan chicken and it was amazing! Moist chicken and lovely flavors.
1,"I like the food and donuts, but and more importantly, I really like the people who run this place and the people who hang out there."
1,"I haven't been here too many times, but the place is great! It has a really nice atmosphere and looks a lot nicer than the clubs I've been to before. The floors weren't sticky and overall the place was actually really clean. I really wasn't expecting that especially since I went to one of the fetish nights. It's a lot smaller than I was expecting. I guess that's probably the difference between clubs in smaller cities and big cities. It's not that big of a deal to me, but I imagine they can't hold a really big crowd. The drinks are fairly strong and aren't too expensive. The bathrooms are very clean and well lit. The staff are all amazingly nice and friendly. I enjoyed taking a drink outside to the smoking area and chatting. The people I met were lovely and I'm excited to meet new people at future events!"
1,"I am a semi-regular customer here, as I live in the neighborhood. Other than the typical music as background noise, the place is relatively quiet and, for me, an ideal study spot on Sundays. Just enough sunlight comes through the rear doors. Past those doors is the popular outdoor seating. There are a few \""Little Free Libraries.\"" Bikers can appreciate the location, as it lies adjacent to the Capital City Trail. Electrical outlets are usually easy to access except during the busy hours when the seating along the wall is taken."
1,"The most chill, relaxing, artistic coffee shop in Madison. Love the outdoor seating watching the bikers go by sipping on an iced tea. Their drinks are great. Service is nice, very polite staff. I also love that it's next to Absolutely Art."
1,I have been a food fight customer and visit all of there restaurants on a regular basis. My favorite is Monty's blue plate. The meatless loaf of the gods is my favorite. Have tried other things and have always been happy. Every year they sell gift certificates and for every one hundred dollars they give you a twenty five dollar certificate. Can't beat that. I load up a gift card with five hundred and eat all year. I would never agree with the people that have bashed their places. Try it you will like it.
1,"They have great discounted used appliances. I got a stove for my parents here and they wanted a different one, so Kirch switched it out. They delivered the stove in the snow storm and took the old one away. Great local company!"
1,"Thank you, thank you, Madison Mallards, for inviting the community to the fireworks on July 5. I hope this becomes a new tradition for Madison's Northside neighborhoods.\n\nThe run-down:\n- I was glad to see you open the stadium for fireworks viewing after the game. Everyone was welcome, even if they did not attend the game.\n- The concessions were still open and serving beer and snacks.\n- Attendees could sit in the stands or have a blanket on the outfield grass (which is soft as carpet, by the way).\n- There was a live band playing great, American rock songs from the 1980s and 1990s. Thank you for not playing that Lee Greenwood song!!!\n- The fireworks were great. They were large, didn't last too long and the right distance from the stadium for viewing.\n\nSpectacular!"
1,"One of the most wonderful places in the world. Great to go in the winter to feel some humidity and feel better, great for summer to see all the flowers. The gift shop is excellent for any (particularly female) gift occasion. Just a great place to go. Would be great for a date."
1,"Note to guys everywhere: Olbrich is a great place to take a date!  You get to walk around in semi-secluded areas and look at beautiful things.  It's romantic without even trying.\n\nI love seeing how both the outdoor gardens and indoor conservatory flowers change at different times of the year.  Plus, the conservatory is so nice and warm during the winter!"
1,"Welcome to my backyard.  \n\nOh wait, I'm hallucinating again.\n\nBut seriously, this place is wonderful.  I love going here, and I do wish my backyard looked like this.\n\nUnfortunately for me, I brought a minor with me.  Minor claims to love nature and wants to see it up close and personal, but at the same time is deathly afraid of bees and butterflies.  Most people can understand being fearful of bees and their stings, but butterflies?  \n\nIt's the kind of irrational fear I can only compare to being terribly frightened by a marshmallow.\n\nIf you were there today, you probably saw the minor racing through the gardens like they were on fire, screaming and crying and begging for mercy from the winged feigns of fiery death and destruction, otherwise known as butterflies.  \n\nI thought I could convince minor to hold my hand and \""trust\"" that I wouldn't let anything bad happen, but apparently I'm a lousy saleswoman and/or my evil plot to feed innocent children to flying insects was all too apparent.  Dang!!!\n\nMinor covered the grounds in record time and was back at the lobby begging to leave.  A wave of relief washed over minor's face when we were safely back in the confines of the car, far far away from the flying death stingers and soul crushing, face smashing butterflies of satan.\n\nBut other than that, this is a lovely place when we are not there.  \n\nThank you and goodnight."
1,Wonderful space. I cannot believe it is free. It is truly a gem of Madison. The history and story behind the Thai Pavilion is remarkable and it's a can't miss. Just keep your grubby little paws off of it if you want it to stick around...
1,"Free and much larger than I expected, this botanical garden was a pleasant surprise.  There are a few corners that are particularly nice, like the Rose Tower and Temple. Meander throughout and try to get lost. Sit a spell on a bench and enjoy the scenery."
1,"I love this place! I cannot believe it took me nearly five years to finally visit after moving to Wisconsin. This is a wonderful place! I love that it's free. I went because I wanted to seethe Thai Pavilion, while it was my favorite thing there, the rest of the gardens were very impressive. I would highly recommend it."
1,"The staff here make the experience. Since I am not a fan of buffets, I can only tell you about the meals here. DELICIOUS. I don't eat meat, my boyfriend almost only eats meat, we both found things we loved. it was the best! We liked to eat here once a week since it was so amazing."
1,"Great for takeout.  They threw in extras for us, which was a nice touch."
1,"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet. This is one of the better Chinese places in Madison, although it can be a little spendy (not too bad, though) compared to your run-of-the-mill Chinese take-out joint. It's worth it, though.\n\nThe menu here is huge, and the portions match. I've never come here and not had leftovers to reheat the next day. \n\nThe food itself is almost always excellent. The wonton soup and anything with duck in it, in particular, are really well-flavored. \n\nThis is also one of the few Chinese restaurants I've been to that does an equally good job of catering the adventurous eaters and people who are a little bit less comfortable with something out of the ordinary. \n\nService is also always friendly and quick, especially considering how big the restaurant is."
1,"Love!   We will be back, and back often.  As our summer Saturday dining trek continues this is the epitome of what we want.  A local joint, that just makes you comfortable and glad to be out.\n\nArrived about 6:30 on a Saturday, and found our way to the new back patio.  A couple of larger groups, but plenty of choice of seating.  Found our table, and service was immediate-friendly, attentive, and just exceptional.  KR had barely ordered and couldn't stop gushing about her love of this place.  \nWe started with the fried pickles, based on previous reviews, and they were perfectly done.\nKR had the Rooster sandwich and enjoyed it so much, she only offered me a tiny bite, As I'm unable to order the same, I was forced to the Tip Top burger, and was not disappointed.  Perfectly done, and flavor throughout.\nAfter another beverage, and just enjoying the evening, we got our check and headed out.\nThanks to other reviews, we knew CASH only, but there is an ATm, so heads up!\n\nPerfect, exactly what we wanted, and this sets the bar for us for the balance of our summer Saturday dining trek."
1,"Finally go to the Tip Top last night for dinner and had a great experience.  Great job with the remodel, and the outdoor patio is very nice as they put up a high enough fence to block the street and make it private, but it is lareg enough to be fun.\n  Excellent liquor and beer selections at reasonable prices.  Food was way better than expected - huge portions, excellent quality, and nicely different than the usual Madtown fare.  \n\nWe had fried pickles which were done with tempura batter so they were not heavy and the slight sweetness of the batter nicely offset the brininess of the pickles.  Huge basket with a great home made dipping sauce ( a remoulade) as well.   Then, thank God cause it is also big, we split a plate of two pepper mac 'n cheese, which was cooked perfectly and the jalapenos were offset perfectly by the poblanos for a flavorful balance.  \n\nTwelve taps, good cocktails, great service and a friendly atmosphere.  Hope you do well Tip Top!"
1,"I live about four blocks from the Tip Top.  I am so happy with this establishment.  I have been going to this place since it has opened under new owners.   Ben and Co. are very amiable and will go well out of their way to make your visit worthwhile.\nCash is King...no credit/debit cards.  Everything is delicious and reasonably priced.  I have made it a point to try everything on their menu.  So far my favorite dish was a \""man maker\"" walleye sandwich (Saturday special) with their own in house remoulade sauce.  You will require extra napkins.  The fried pickles are really good too... you may need to get some extra Tip Top sauce.  Bloodies and Brunch on the patio are a must.  They also have several specialty adult beverages... I would highly recommend the Ghost Mary.  The tap list caters to my ever changing palate... with Nitro on tap as well.  Overall, this is a fantastic little neighborhood tavern that has a terrific atmosphere and is a welcome amenity to the local area."
1,"The food is a cut above most bars. I don't give many reviews, but I needed to give my favorite place one.   Not sure if you want breakfast or lunch?  Have the rooster. It's basically a BLT with 2 fried eggs on a grilled cheese sandwich. What more could you want!?  The burgers are made with very high quality meat, and the bun is soft without falling apart. They're also doing a nice Fish Fry on Fridays. \nThe place looks great. If you were ever in before the renovation, it's hard to believe your in the same bar. I really thought they took down a wall or something. I've found the staff friendly and have had many fun conversations at the bar."
1,"Some of the best bar food in the state.  Burgers and Pizza are always a fantastic choice.  Entertainment is hit or miss, but at least they have some.  However, my favorite reason to go here is it serves the coldest tap beer ever!!!"
1,"The perfect place for the near-east side. Good to very good drinks (depending on the bar tender) and yummy pub food -- especially the walnut burger. It has a workaday feel, with a side of liberal politics and an accepting and welcoming attitude. Somehow it's not overpopulated with posers which makes it just about my favorite place in town."
1,"The Harmony hours listed are dead wrong and they are open, not closed. Makes me wonder about the fact-checkers at yelp... do they have any?"
1,this place has a shuffleboard table and a nice dive bar ambiance.  Don the weeknight bartender was voted best bartender in Madison by the Isthmus' reader's choice poll.
1,"Now that I live next door, I've really come to appreciate this place. Want a pizza? They'll cook it to your exact specifications. Want a drink? Don and/or Ted will mix you up right. Prices are super reasonable. Crowd is always fantastic. Such a great neighborhood joint!"
1,"My first ever trip to Woody-Anne's involved a lady at the bar a) showing off a pic that proved ghosts exist cuz of an \""orb\"" that is inexplicably present(?), b) flashing me her boobs for a drink that she never actually took me up on, and c) giving me an epicly gross (DRIPPING) wet willy, all in the span of Fleetwood Mac's \""Landslide\"" which soundtracked the whole experience.\n\nThe evening ended with me and the bartender watching a M.A.S.H. rerun in what was by then an otherwise empty bar.\n\nNeedless to say, this is my New Favorite Place."
1,A great family business. They are a pleasure to work with and very good at problem solving.
1,"I'm not a die hard BBQ fan nor do I normally spring for it when I'm hungry but after eating here I may change my tune.\nThe ribs are amzaing, the meat practically falls off the bone and is so tender!! The pulled pork sandwich is equally delicious and the serving size is more than generous. The sweet bisquits are a nice way to end the meal, served piping hot and covered in powdered sugar; although ordering them serperate is recommended as the baked beans and fries are a must have!!"
1,"BEST SWEET MEAT IN MADISON! The sauce is unique and fantastic with tiny onion pieces in it contributing a bite to the sweetness of the base with it's slight tang. The meat is prepared exactly how you'd expect--falling off the bone with a slight resistance. I'd kill for these ribs! ...I'm serious... For take out, I find the ribs to be a little under sauced. I bought a bottle of Smoky Jon's Sauce to take home to load up the ribs."
1,"We tried to go to this place on a Monday; oops, not open. After 10 months of living in the Madison area, we have found THE RIB PLACE. The ribs are great, so is the brisket, the corn, beans...you get the idea. The restaurant is a little small but the service was amazing. Watching my family eat was almost as good as the food, almost. I highly recommend Smoky Jon's #1 BBQ."
1,I now know what you get when you pray to baby Jesus... these ribs. SO GOOD!!!!!!!
1,best bbq in madison
1,"Smoky Jon's is absolutely the best barbeque joint in Madison, bar-none. \n\nThe ribs are fall-off-the-bone tender and cooked to perfection, but their brisket is a real treat - slightly smokey with a seasoning that compliments their barbeque sauce amazingly.  Their meats are served with your choice of all the classic barbeque joint sides that you would expect - my favorites are the beans and the coleslaw, the latter of which is rich and creamy (not oily and bland like the \""Creamy Coleslaw\"" at Brickhouse).\n\nI'm astounded by the reviewers who prefer the likes of  Brickhouse BBQ or Famous Dave's to Smoky Jon's and can only assume that they have never had real Kansas City or Texas barbeque.  If you want authentic barbeque, nothing beats Smoky Jon's."
1,Tucked away on the north side of Madison. I've driven past it thousands of times but went there yesterday on a recommendation from a friend of mine who knows his BBQ. Soooooo gooooooood. I had the pork shoulder sandwich. The baked beans were pure flavor country. I wish everything I ate from here on out could be drizzled in that BBQ sauce. Service was pretty quick and the prices were not bad either. I'll be coming back again.
1,"When thinking BBQ you do not think of Madison,WI.  This is the one exception to that rule.  The food here is by hands down the best BBQ in Southern Wisconsin, there is nothing on the menu that you can go wrong with.  What is even better the award winning sauce does not mask or cover bad meat but creates an even better experience.  \n\nSeating is limited and parking is even more so, you can park on the side road (Manley St)  off of Packers Ave."
1,"The ribs are the best BBQ in Madison by far and have never disappointed in many visits. The rest of the menu is inconsequential -- trust me, just get the ribs."
1,"This was our first time trying Smokey Jons.  It is a new favorite for sure.  The space was small but cozy, and the food definitely deserves best in Madison (or the universe).  Patanne (the lovely lady who took our order) was friendly and made us feel right at home.  We will be back."
1,WwoOOW!  It is really that good here!  If u don't stop u are missing out BIG TIME!  Great food!
1,"Stopped in for the first time today, couldn't be more happy with the experience. Ribs were excellent,  service was great and very attentive.  Highly recommend Smoky Jon's and will be visiting again soon."
1,"I bought a spaghetti dinner and it was really good food. Hot, tasted good, and decent sized serving for the price. I liked that I got my food quickly and the staff was friendly. There is a drive-thru."
1,"Helpful, friendly staff. Great selection of food and supplies for dogs, cats, birds, fish, rodents and amphibians. They sell cats (many roam the store, so watch your step!), birds, fish and other little beasts, too! They also offer fantastic dog obedience classes and pet grooming -actually, I give them an extra high rating because of the great job they did shaving my cat! Half as expensive as most places and they let me witness/help out as needed, which is much less stressful for my mankitty than the places that require you to drop off your pet for a few hours (or the day)."
1,"I've been going to this interdependently owned video game store since the owner's first location in the early 90's! This definitely is the best video game shop in Madison! I mean, the only other places I can think of are PrePlayed or Half-Price Books for older cartridge based games. I usually hang around to talk and bring in super random gaming goods to sell or trade! Highly recommended! Believe It!"
1,"It' where you should go to buy and sell games.  Avoid Gamestop and the other chains.  Keep this guy in business.  He isn't always able to buy your stuff, so call ahead of time if you have something specific to sell."
1,"It's hard to find a good auto repair place where you won't get taken advantage of.  Because of the great reviews on Yelp, I drove out of my way to take my car to Chet's.  I'm a young woman with an old car that I didn't want to put a lot of money into.  I just need my car to last me another year or so until I can afford a new one.  I dropped by Chet's without an appointment or anything, and one of the mechanics came out to the parking lot to take a look at my car right away (free of charge).  He actually got on the ground to peak under my car, and he knew what the problem was in less than a minute.  He answered all my questions, and I arranged to bring my car back the next day to get fixed.  When I brought my car in to get fixed, the guy at the front desk recognized me right away and slipped me a coupon from their ad for 10% off my services because he knew that I didn't want to put a lot of money into my car.  I was taken aback by his thoughtfulness.  The mechanics kept me informed as they were working on my car, gave me the estimate, gave me their opinion, and answered all my questions.  All around great service at a reasonable price."
1,"I called today when I was in a frenzy because my car was acting up, and I was not in my neck of the woods.  \n\nI received a caring voice on the other end.  Unfortunately, he was not able to service my car because they were booked solid, but he gave me suggestions and recommended another establishment.  \n\nI truly think this must be a good place that cares about its customers.\n\nThank you!"
1,"We've taken several different cars to Chet's over the years, and have always found the service to be honest, reasonably-priced, and very friendly! They've changed our oil, jumped our battery, fixed several mechanical issues, and never insisted that we go in for more expensive services (even when those have been recommended). And just today, a kindly fellow installed our front license plate at no charge! Doesn't get much better than this."
1,"Best car place I know, recommend to everyone.\n\nJust picked up my car, it came in *under* the estimate they gave me. \n\nBeen driving for oh 30 years now, in 3 different states, and this is by far my favorite car place."
1,"Chet is an old school stand up guy with professional integrity that you don't see so much of anymore. My storage rental experience could not have been better. He let me use as many of his pallets as I needed with no extra charge; he was extremely kind about every interaction. My deposit was returned immediately with a hand written thank you note from Chet. I mean, who does that? I had zero moisture or mold issues with the storage unit itself, although everything was in there for 2+ months thru the hot, wet, humid end of summer. Extremely pleased. Can I give six stars?"
1,"I'm a big fan of eating Midwest brunches and I can tell quality vs. quantity.\n\nMy boyfriend took me here on a surprise date because he is a big fan of watching planes take off, so I thought it was novel to have brunch there.\n\nThe quality of the food blew me away as well as the friendly service. \n\nWe ordered crab cakes benedict with hollandaise sauce and the 2x2x2 (pancakes, 2 eggs, bacon, and fruit cup OR hashbrowns).  The other reviewers down below are correct that their pancakes are TDF light airy and buttery delicious. \n\nThe crab cakes benedicts were perfect - not too rich, and not too heavy and very nicely presented.  The waitress was a middle aged woman who was very attentive to us.\n\nThe price is also very reasonable for brunches in Madison. I would highly recommend this place, and I believe it is one of Madison's best kept secret diners.  It wasn't as cheap as the Come Back Inn located near the Essen Haus nor Plaka's Mediterranean meat intensive style brunches, however, the quality was far superior (and don't get me wrong, I adore the Come Back Inn!)\n\nYou'll also be interested in the proudly presented amateur photos of Air Force One from when President Obama visited Madison in Nov 2009, the staff were happy to give the run down of his landing at the private airstrip."
1,"One of my favorite places in town for breakfast. \nIt's quick (once you're seated).\nIt's greasy (like breakfast from a skillet should be).\nIt's no-nonsense (hash, taters, eggs).\nIt's served with a smile (and usually some awesome conversation).\nIs it super local? Super sustainable?\nNo.\nIt's a diner. \nBut a delicious one.\nAnd there are planes!"
1,"Thanks for making a great trip even better - quick, caring service and a free upgrade to a great Jeep Patriot that we really enjoyed. Enterprise is all I've used for years and I don't see myself ever changing. Rare that service in your business is this good."
1,Awesome breakfast!
1,"I love breakfast, and at Cottage Cafe, they really get it right.  The food is the biggest hit with lots of basic American breakfast fare options.  Expect to leave stuffed as the portion sizes are pretty big.  The coffee service is awesome and the whole staff is quite friendly and efficient.  You get all of this at a super reasonable price."
1,"First of all, how has no one reviewed Michael's yet?  They have the best everything!  The best frozen yogurt, certainly the best fried cheese curds EVER, and the best root beer.  Michael's is open kind of later than you might expect, and has a nice patio to sit outside in the summer.  They now offer K-9 custard, so you can bring your dog too!  \n\nMy cat likes ice cream, I wonder if K-9 custard could be good for felines?"
1,"In Madison to watch some club soccer at the park down the road. Skipped breakfast and needed to fill my belly with some lip lickin food that comes fast. \n\nMichael's looked like a gimmick, but was the closest place I could find. They're going for a 50s nostalgia drive-thru and for the most part it works! I recommend going inside to also taste the retro ambiance. \n\nFood? Happy to report significantly better than your average fast food joint. My bacon cheeseburger was dripping with just off the grill grease. It's a quality burger with fresh veggies to boot. And you won't find fries like this even at a sitdown restaurant. Holy delicious.\n\nNext time I'll try the shake."
1,"Terri was an amazing find to do our flowers in Madison. She did a great job helping a bride that knew very litter about flowers and wanted to keep the budget down with a 250 person wedding and a huge wedding party. At the consultation Terri took the few ideas I had, and created a list of flowers both wild in her own gardens and that she could get from other local vendors to help me reach the vision I wanted at the budget I wanted. The flowers turned out to be beautiful and Terri was a pleasure to work with. I would highly recommend her"
1,"Everyone here is very nice. You can really tell they all absolutely love animals. I called and they got my cat in the next day. They couldn't get a urine sample, so they gave me another appointment the next day for no charge. The facility is clean and up to date. I'm coming here from now on!"
1,"I can count on Dave.   He is HONEST.  A trait hardly seen in the car repair business these days.  I am afraid to buy anything other than a VW because I would never want to lose \""my mechanic.\""  He's simply the best.  - Bob M & Sile S."
1,Awesome BBQ.
1,"I love this place!\n\nMy son and I were driving back from the Wisconsin Dells and decided to pull off for lunch and we found Fat Jacks on my GPS.\n\nThe outside of the place isn't very impressive, but some of the best bbq places I've ever been to have been dumps.  The inside is much nicer, decorated with local Wisconsin artifacts and pictures.  My favorite was the old beer bottle collection by the entrance.\n\nAnyway, we got sat and our waitress came over right away....super friendly and super nice lady.  We asked for a recommendation and she basically went over the whole menu and said everything was great, and after eating there, I believe her.\n\nI ordered the pulled pork lunch and my son got the fish fry.  When she brought over the plates, I knew we were in trouble...there was sooo much food! \n\nMy son's fish was very good, not greasy but light and flaky.  My pork was excellent.  The waitress asked if we wanted a hotter bbq sauce, I love spicy, so she brought it.  Excellent!  Smokey, spicy flavor.  The sauces on the table were really good too.\n\nIf you are looking for some good, casual, non-pretentious BBQ, Fat Jack's is the place for you!  Don't let the outside fool you, the inside is clean and the food is excellent and they give you a ton of it!"
1,Best BBQ in madison. The best night is Thursday. All you can eat chicken and ribs. Their coleslaw is the vinegar oil kind. Not creamy. I love it. Some of the staff has worked there for years - a nod to this awesome locally/family owned eatery.
1,"I was in search of a new refrigerator, I did a lot or searching online. I found that Brothers Main promises low prices.  I went in one evening to look around and was hoping to settle on something that evening.  The gentleman working the floor was extremely nice, wasn't pushy at all. He was very patient with me (I think I looked over some refrigerators like 20 times!). He was very knowledgeable and if he didn't know something, he looked it up or consulted with another colleague. Once I found the refrigerator that I wanted to purchase, he showed me that they were indeed the lowest price (he brought up other competitor's prices via internet), and he even knocked off additional money to be sure. He discussed that within 30 days if the price became lower somewhere else, they would refund me the difference. I had my refrigerator delivered and the two gentleman who installed it were VERY nice and a pleasure to work with.  My whole experience with Brothers Main was a very positive one. It's always a pleasure to support local businesses, and they do show their appreciation for their customers.  Will definitely be getting future appliances through them."
1,I went in to get my Viper remote replaced because my other two stopped working and instead of just selling me a new one right away the owner tried to see if it was battery or something else. I like the honesty of that and he was very friendly and fast and replacing the remote and re-programming it to my car. I highly recommend this place!
1,One of our family's favorite choices for pizza...staff has always been very friendly and helpful at this location even when we have to customize their specialty pizzas for the kids. Over the summer we have also tried their s'mores pizza and it was a big hit.  Our favorite right now is the  Herb Chicken Mediterranean....would definitely recommend giving it a try.
1,"I love this place, have been going to \""Poppas\"" for years, started back when they were on the corner of Milwaukee and Stoughton. Best place to get Dogs and Gyros.  The building may be run down, the booths maybe hard plastic, but the Gyros and Chicago dogs are worth the trip for a great lunch!"
1,I grew up on this food. I even worked here at one point in time. This place is amazing. Eat here or else...
1,"This is not only a grocery store, it's a staple in the community. Tim and Kevin Metcalfe have kept the tradition alive! Yes, this store is pricier than others but you do indeed get what you pay for. The Metcalfes also give back more to the community that all the rest of the grocery retailers combined!  This is a good hearted family running an excellent local grocery store."
1,"One of the coolest grocery stores I've ever seen. Between a variety of self-service bars and posting how many food miles the items are, this location is definitely ahead of the curve with grocery stores, without charging out the wazoo like Whole Foods."
1,"Built out of an old Country Kitchen, this friendly neighborhood bar and grill has lots of room.  Great food at a reasonable price too I might add.  If you are a sports fan, this is a great bar...several TV sets with your favorite games.  If it's your birthday, you'll get to drink free tap beer all night long too.  The employees are very friendly and attentive.  Visti the website: http://www.silvereaglebar.net/"
1,"My sister and I decided to give our mom a complete \""makeover\"" as a gift. I called multiple salons to inquire if they would be able to strip color out of my mom's hair. (She decided to stop coloring her hair and let her hair grow out, so she had grey/white on top and dark brown a few inches down.)\nMany of the salons said that it could not be done. When I spoke with someone at the Ultimate Spa Salon, they stated that they would be able to lighten the color so it would blend better with her natural hair color. \nThe stylist was very nice, discussed what she was going to be doing.  She put lightener on my mom's hair a few times. I was nervous that it wasn't going to work.  \nShe got a new hairstyle, and when it was all done, she looked FABULOUS!  I was very pleased with how it came out.  It was pricey to have it done, but when it comes to a drastic change, I'd say it's worth it!"
1,"If you love steak, you'll love Ken's.  I take that back.  If you love meat PERIOD, you'll love Ken's.  They have the best steaks ever, and the chicken breasts are huge.  Their brats are really good, as are the rubbed pork grillers.\nThey have a variety of other picnic staples like potato salads and macaroni salads and some produce.  Then, add to all that, they have a convenience store attached so you can buy some pop or beer or whatever.\n\nMy personal favorites are the burgandy pepper steaks.  It just doesn't get any better."
1,"Only been there once and been wanting go back again soon. We used to go to that side of town once a month and I would wonder about this place with my husband's name. So one day, stopped there to see if they have anything quick to eat. Fresh sandwiches were great....made the way we wanted. The place was clean and very friendly. Too bad,found it after I no longer live on that side of town."
1,The best meat market in Madison. It has great gresh chicken brests. Get the burgundy marinaded steak. Check it out.
1,"I stop here for the meats and fresh made sandwiches. It is a convenience store with a very nice meat case. There are reviews on here complaining that they don't have an actual butcher shop. There are not that many around anymore so deal with it or butcher your own. Burgundy Pepper Steaks are marvelous. I tried to marinate my own, but have not been able to match these. Reasonable prices."
1,I stop in often to pick up things for craft projects. The people are always friendly and I can almost always find what I need. Often times for less than the big box craft stores. I grew up going to this store and love the location. Easy to stop in and pick up a few things. Love it here!
1,"Best pizza I've found in Madison.  I love thin crust and this is thin and crispy!  Not fancy gourmet,  but delicious pizza!  Great deals online,  $5 off 2 large and the guys that are usually working are pretty chill.  Save your receipts for even more savings! Glad I found this place,  reminds me of pizza back home even the bags they come in!"
1,"Best Jamaican food in the whole state!! And they're even FROM Jamaica! How's that for authenticity! It's a family run business and I got that sense of family by just eating there.\n\nUnfortunately I moved from Madison and my tummy cries for their food all the time! Whenever I am in town though, I stop there --especially for their all you can eat buffet on Fridays. They get kinda nervous when I walk in because I eat all their food. I can't help it! It's all so tasty. They use the perfect amount of seasonings and their meat, like their chicken and ribs, is so succulent meat falls off the bone and melts in your mouth. Plus it doesn't have that \""chain restaurant\"" type feeling. You go in there, you eat great food and they let you enjoy yourself.\n\nWhen they first opened, I asked the owners why they didn't open up other locations because their food was so darn good. And they said they didn't want to get too big and compromise the food. That kind of dedication in what they do really spoke to me. It spoke to my belly too.\n\nPineapple Salmon--awesome! Jerk tofu--awesome! Meat patties--awwww yeeaahhh! You have GOT to try this place! Stop reading this and go now! Do it!!"
1,"I love it!  The Jerk chicken is fantastic, with authentic flavor.  The veggies are amazing, I love the spicey kick to them, personally I always get the potato salad cause I am not a fan of beans and rice but they usually are out of the potato salad, so I just get extra veggies!  The food is great."
1,"This place is amazing for their lunch buffet! I love their mango chicken and banana cake! I'm not sure if it's just the food or what, but the Pepsi seems to taste different. In a good way, though. I usually hate Pepsi. The environment of the place is really relaxed. I love going here."
1,"One of my favorite spots in Madison. It is a hidden gem, serving delicious, authentic Jamaican cuisine. The owners are originally from Jamaica and having visited the island several times myself, it's about as good as you can get outside of Jamaica. The curried goat is amazing and the prices are very reasonable. The owners are very charming. I never leave the establishment disappointed."
1,"Great food, . fast.  We carry out from there at least once a month, sometimes more."
1,Old packer is now chiefs tavern. Cleaned up remodeled.great food and beer! Very clean.
1,"Great place in Madison to find top notch wines and cigars.  The cigar humidor is huge with a fantastic selection.  And when you find the one you want, sit down, light it up and enjoy!  About the only place in Madison you can do that at.  They also have some really nice tasting events where you can try out a variety of wine, scotch and cigars."
1,"Probably THE best place to get cigars in the area. I've only been here twice, but I will definitely be going here again soon. They know their stuff and are very helpful. After a short chat about what types of cigars I've had the recommendations came flowing. There's a huge selection, so if you do know what you're looking for they will probably have it."
1,"This paddle sport supply store is stocked to the rafters with a staggering selection of everything you could possibly ever need to get your crazy paddle on.  Owners, Jeff and Darren, are friendly and quick to answer even silly newbie questions."
1,"Amazing selection of product, and very knowledgable staff. Location is great because you can paddle right from the back door."
1,"Baby it's cold outside. \nBut I'm so prepared for snow it's not even funny! \nNow here's the thing...\n\nI was a desert dweller for close to seven years, so when I moved to Madison in autumn 2012 I refused to believe that temps drop as low as people proclaimed. And my first winter here was mild. Last year, however, was rough stuff. I remember being told to stay indoors and was warned not to go outside without my face covered by several reputable weather peeps. It was brisk... rull brisk. \n\nSo this year I decided I was going to do winter right! And for me that meant paying a premium for a base layer (top and bottom) that I plan to live in until May. There are several websites that offer an insane amount of information comparing and contrasting fiber counts and materials and weight and oder retention, and then there's Rutabaga. Where owner Darren has his equipped team of outdoorsmen and outdoors-women are prepared to answer pretty much any question about any product they carry. And what's more, they've all been there... in the great outdoors. \n\nThe gent going back and forth with me today talked up the IceBreaker Merino Wool tight and crew, explaining that to him, nothing feels better. (And he wears the stuff on the daily.) He also led me to another option, super.natural, which comes in at a lower price-point but doesn't have the fab feel of the more expensive option. He also mentioned that super.natural tends to fit a bit closer to the body. At this point it was time to try things on. And even though they have a generous return policy, I wanted to leave with something I knew I'd love. \n\nSo I'm in the fitting room with both brands' top and bottom and just as described, the IceBreaker felt great but the super.natural fit great. And at the end of the day, knowing I wanted to take home two sets, I went with the super.natural for fit and price, and picked up a pair of socks to complete my ensemble. They carry Smart Wool in every solid, pattern, stripe and polka dot, and an interesting brand made in the US called FITS, which has a cool heel lock that's supposed to keep the sock in place. I thought I was going to walk out of there with some Smart Wool as friends talk it up like it's gold for your feet, but after hearing about the quality going downhill since inception, FITS is what I was feeling.\n\nI can't remember the last time I spent so much on underwear. I'm going to say never. But it'll be worth the money when later this month everyone else feels like a popsicle and I'm warm but not toast, breathable and not damp. \n\nRutabaga also has a stellar selection of snow shoes, and I'm eying a pair from a company based in Denver that uses 95% recycled material to make a Cadillac-like kick. If you're not up for the investment, they also rent winter equipment, and a big part of their business is paddlesports come summer."
1,"Phenomenal locally owned store for outdoor enthusiasts. I like to buy local whenever I can and this store reminds me a lot of REI but with the added bonus of being locally owned. I've always received outstanding customer service and found the staff to go out of their way to find a solution for me. I just finished my holiday shopping here because they have a ton of little things that make great stocking stuffers for anyone like balms, solar lights for camping, doggy gear, kid stuff, etc. \n\nI often like to gauge a business by the happiness of its employees and when I talk with them about working at Rutabaga, they never hesitate to sing the praises of this very cool store. Looking forward to my next visit!"
1,"First of all, this is Culvers.  I love the mushroom and swiss burger, delicious, I crave it and I am not a fast food person!   They custards are to die for and I am glad that I do not live by a culvers because I would probably try to eat there every day!  I love their food, service has always been great here!"
1,"Kicking it up a star because draaaanks are cheap, service it bomb and food is consistently tay-hay-sty."
1,"We've been bringing our two Treeing Walker Coonhounds here since we added the second dog to our family.  We'd been using a different, more expensive kennel when we had only one dog but needed a more reasonably-priced option with 2.  Hickory Hills has been fantastic for us!\n\nIt's a great value, our dogs are EXTREMELY high energy and VERY social with other dogs.  The play times while boarding are perfect and we know they have a GREAT time by how exhausted they are for 2 days afterwards!\n\nWe usually end the stay with a bathing.  Coonhounds have short, straight-haired coats but shed terribly.  Baths usually don't hold their good smell on our dogs for long, but usually with these, the smell lasts about a week and shedding is much better in the days immediately following their stay.  They do a good job.\n\nOne last instance of AWESOME customer service: we got stuck in traffic on I-94 today but had specifically departed early so as to make it to Suter's by 6 to pick up the dogs.  We knew we'd be late, called ahead to beg them to wait for us, and the girl at the desk agreed to stay 30 minutes after her shift so we could pick up our dogs tonight rather than tomorrow morning.  This has happened on two occasions.\n\nThe staff knows our dogs, their quirks and characteristics, and you can tell they love what they do.  We'll be bringing them here for YEARS down the road!!"
1,"Now these guys take coffee drinking to a whole new level! I usually add cream and sugar to coffee to knock off the acidity but I drink this brew black and pure. It's phenomenal! \n\nI also love the fact that they are into sustainable farming practices and they're educating people all over the world in regard to coffee quality, sustainable farming practices, and coffee service. \n\nDo yourself a huge favor and try it! I know Rosie's Coffee Bar & Bakery on Monona Drive serves it. You'll have a brand new experience in coffee drinking."
1,"This review is for Oakhouse @ the Capitol Square Farmers' Market (CSFM) location.\n\nThey are not exactly an underground bakery at the Farmers' Market,  but they certainly don't get their deserved props.  Oakhouse's delights include breads, donuts, scones and specialties are loaded.\n\nThere are other bakeries at the market including Stella's.  Based on the crowds and the number of reviewers on Yelp, Stella's gets all the love.   However, based on my consumption of their breads and pastries while also comparing prices and customer service, Oakhouse backhands Stella's with a silicone pastry brush (granted, Stella's has the moistest and most flavorful cheese danishes in the area).\n \nI have always appreciated Oakhouse's efficiency and consistency.  They are very organized package bakery perfectly.  I never had anything smushed by being jammed in (like other places).  They rarely struggle with stocking or maintaining an attractive display.  I have never felt ignored or frustrated by cash handlers.  These are amazing accomplishments factoring in the madness of the CSFM.\n\nMy change your life recommendation is their Napoleon. It is the eclair's hotter sibling. Oakhouse's offering is a ginormous & gorgeous pile of puff pastry, vanilla cream and vanilla/chocolate glaze decadence.  The layer offers dynamic and perfect flavor combinations vs. the eclair's often disappointing cream to pastry ratio.\n\nNext time you go to the CSFM... sting Stella's and make a beeline to Oakhouse.  They may be -1 on product marketing, but more thank make up for it on their delicious delivery.  Once you save time, a little cash and make your sweet tooth sparkle, you can thank me later."
1,"I'm a Madison native and usually stay with my parents. But this trip for a family funeral called for a hotel. We figured we might end up staying a week (eventually did eight nights) so wanted something more homelike with a separate bedroom and living area. And we wanted to do it economically. The Grandstay was perfect and well under neighboring Staybridge, Residence Inn and others.\n\nWe had never heard of the chain before and found it on Expedia. It was perfect. Every single staff person we encountered all week made us feel at home. Anything we needed was taken care of. \n\nBeing primarily a longstay hotel, you don't see a lot of the guests. We actually went a few days before seeing anyone else on our schedule. We felt like we owned the place. \n\nThe lobby became our living room, with a nice fireplace and overstuffed chairs. The breakfast room was perfect for gathering with friends who also came in for a few nights. The pool was the highlight for our local grandaughter who came to visit.\n\nWe stayed in a one-bedroom suite. I also checked out the two-bedroom and one-room suites. The rooms were all decent size and very comfortable. Kitchenettes featured a full-sized refrigerator, cooktop, dishwasher and microwave.\n\nRooms include a complimentary breakfast with a wide range of choices including hot waffles.\n\nThe location is outstanding, with easy access to the freeway. It was 10 minutes to the airport, 15 minutes to downtown. There are lots of really good restaurant choices at nearby East Towne, and a fabulous sports bar (Pooleys) just a block away.\n\nThanks to the management for a great stay. We would absolutely make this our permanent stop in Madison next time."
1,"After finding this hotel during a crisis a few years ago, we've continued to make it our home away from home in Madison on several trips. I still can't believe that for $70 you can get such a great suite with a full breakfast."
1,"This review is a long time coming since I've been to Pooley's for pinball an embarrassing number of times in the last couple months. There's good reason - they have 4 pinball games!\n\nFirst of all, Pooley's is home to Mad Rollin Pinball (AKA Madison Pinball) - I haven't made it out for a tournament but it's exciting that they host. Madison Pinball is a group of local collectors and enthusiasts and the games you see at Pooley's come from them. Currently they have: Addams Family, Space Shuttle, Star Trek, and Fun House.\n\nI love Addams Family, in fact it's my second favorite pinball in Madison! It's a very fun game with some cool magnet effects, including a seance mode (you just have to check it out). Space Shuttle is really fascinating for an older game but may be slow-moving for folks who are interested in more modern pinball. Star Trek - variations of this game are common around Madison but its still a favorite game of mine. I first began to understand pinball strategy playing Star Trek and think its a great game to start a pinball obsession for anyone. Fun House is frustrating but a classic as well, another solid game. Next to Rossi's, I think this is the best place to bring a group for pinball. \n\nOutside of the games, Pooley's gets a win because the bartenders are always kind and a few of them are pinball nuts too."
1,Keep up all the good work at the Humane Society.
1,"Great little sushi place worth trying. I'm vegetarian so I can only speak for the vegetarian dishes but its tasty, fresh, and easy."
1,Sushi Box has been consistently great!! I love the small space and the owner is very friendly. Most of the sushi is very affordable. We will continue to be regular customers =)
1,"They do a fantastic job here- fast, efficient and inexpensive. My car is always sparkling. They sell booklets of basic washes plus some extra (rain-x, under flush, matt cleaning, etc) that my dad always gets my brother, me, and our significant others for Christmas- it's really useful for getting the salt off in the winter"
1,"They continue to impress me! I finally remembered to ask them at the end of the wash to take a sticker off my window that I had partially stuck there for 2+ years. They had me pull forward and used a little scraper and some cleaner and it came right off!\n\nThe only annoying thing is the guy who 'takes your order' always tries to up-sell. I'm pretty sure he works on commission though and usually doesn't push it when I tell him, \""No, no thank you- no underflush this time. I know you really think I need it and maybe I'll get it next time\"""
1,"Took my fianc\u00e9es car to the Octopus as little get well present from an untimely mirror vs garage accident.\n\nAt first you may feel some sticker shock when you see the prices however, you need to have an idea before you pull up if you want either a full service wash or the pricier fast detail service.  Don't worry, the friendly service advisors are not on the hustle. The staff is very honest and even handed me the iPhone I forgot on the seat as I got out of the car.\n\nThe Diamond Package is your best bet and unless you are have a real messy car, your sure to get a good, through wash.  The staff works endlessly from the time you pull into the wash bay to the time they help with the doors when you get back in to pullout into the street.  They even wipe down the dash and clean the insides of the windows.\n\nThe only thing I forgot to mention is that the Octopus is kid friendly for all ages (myself included). Make sure to let the little ones blast the cars with the \""sudszilla\"" as they roll  by but, don't be shy about taking a turn yourself =)"
1,"They were flexible, got us in quickly (on a Tues.)  and even corrected a mistake they made when they estimated the price.  We just had the rear brakes and rotor replaced for a 2008 Volkwagen Jetta SEL2.5, as well as an oil change.  They found a secondary problem due to us taking so long to get the brakes fixed.  Due to work schedules and having to get the work done on a Tuesday, they drove me to and from work so I could drop off the car and pick it up when it was done.  They also were very friendly and helpful during the entire process.   I would very much recommend their work in the future."
1,"The staff and the vets are always very friendly, helpful, and compassionate. I see Rebecca and Curt for my cats, and recommend them both. I have never had a problem getting an appointment. I really like that they both explain thoroughly everything they are doing and why they re doing it. \n\nOne thing I really appreciate is the separate entrances for cats and dogs. This reduces my cats' stress considerably.\n\nWhen I had to put down one of my cats, everyone was very caring and sympathetic and gave me plenty of information so that I could make a good decision."
1,"It took a little time for me to find a nail salon that I like and is affordable...but I finally found one that exceeds my expectations!  I always come for pedicures and occasionally manicures.  I am going to try acrylics in the spring, so an update is coming.  The prices are very reasonable.\n\nMy favorite part of this salon is the leg and foot massages that you get with your pedi.  The first give you a hot stone rub with oil, THEN a standard massage with lotion.  OHMYGOD, it is so relaxing."

Maybe it'd be better in Texas, but I think they'd even say this was pretty good.\nI really miss it now that I'm in California. Just been disappointed by about every BBQ place out here. They definitely don't match up to Hickory River."
1,"Dear Hickory River,\nI miss you so much.  I live in San Francisco now and I still look back fondly on my college years and Hickory River was a big part of it.  I went to U of I for 9 years and probably ate here 80 times, and loved it maybe 78 of them.  I've never had a more consistently good restaurant experience than this one.  My mouth is watering every time I think of the sliced beef brisket with hot sauce and hot link sausage.... soooooooooo fricken good.  off the charts... the only bbq I've ever had that was better was Sam's in Austin.  \n\nFee free to send me some sauce and brisket and I'll send you some warm winter thoughts when it's not snowing here."
1,"OMG!  This place just gets better and better.  We are having to make excuses to go to Urbana from rural Tolono.  Wish they would bring one to the Savoy area.  \n\nMy husband got the 3 meat, 2 sides platter.  He was sooo happy with his choices. sliced Beef Brisket,,(so tender!) sliced  Polish,, and a pile of sliced smoked ham.  The meat was pleantiful to say the least....he scarffed the whole platter down; smacking his lips after every bite.  I'm afraid I wasn't much different.  I got the smoked humongus baked potato with pulled pork and hot sauce and then proceeded to the potato topping bar for lots of butter, onions, shredded cheddar, halapeno's with a smidge of habenaro sauce on the side.  I have enough left over for lunch tomorrow and dinner tomorrow night and still share some with hubby. \n\nThis place is the best.  The employees are friendly, helpful and have great attitudes.  Probably because they're looking forward to their next break so they can partake of some of these lipsmacking great smoked delicasies!\n\nW and S \nTolono, IL"

1,"This place is awesome.\nIt's tucked away next to the County Market in Urbana (I drove around looking for it and almost missed it), and it was hopping when I was there (I think a Thursday evening around 6 or 7). They have a full takeout menu and then on the side of the wall they've stapled cardboard to the wall and written specials on it. I don't know how often these change, but they are very reasonably priced ($4-6 and come with rice). I ordered the subgum wonton soup and the hunan vegetables (special). The subgum wonton soup was huge and had vegetables, plump wontons, the most tender white meat chicken I've ever had, slices of roast pork, and big succulent shrimp. The broth was very nicely flavored and I will definitely get it again. The hunan vegetables had snow peas, baby corn, water chestnuts, carrots, broccoli, peppers, and tofu in the delectable hunan sauce (my favorite). This food fed me for two meals, and could feed anyone with a normal appetite more. I will be back many many times."
1,"I just realized that I have been eating here for years, driving from the other side of town even, but I had never written a review.  Well here it is.  I have gotten food from First Wok for the last 8 or 9 years, on a regular basis, and I can't remember a time where I was not happy.  I lived in Chicago for 6 years, but came back to visit family a lot and always made sure to get it while I was here.  The pot stickers are like 4 or 5 bucks and they are enough for a meal for one.  They have your typical fried appetizers and they are not greasy.  I am not going to try to remember every dinner or lunch that I have ordered, but they were all good.  It is totally worth going to sunnycrest to get it."
